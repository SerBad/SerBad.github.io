反思\n\n说起来我不太会谈恋爱，谈恋爱有那么多的小心思，那么多的浪漫，那么多的惊喜，那么多的意外去创造，我其实不太会去创造这些，所以一直很认同你说我难怪没有女朋友。我对谈恋爱中的那些不如意会不知所措，我对恋爱中的那些美好却没有感同身受过，所有的快乐与美好都是我自己为自己带来的，我总感觉，追你的时候给你的东西，都是我自己想要但却没有得到的。\n\n所以，我一直问自己爱情到底是什么？是举案齐眉，是轰轰烈烈，是琴瑟和鸣，是油盐酱醋，还是什么别的东西？也许应该这么说，爱情是两个人来创造的，不存在什么必要的条件，只有两个人舒服的相处才是爱情。我想一直以来，最喜欢的一句情话就是“我想和你一起浪费那个午后的时光”，静静地陪伴在一个阳光洒满的窗台，看着相爱的彼此，感觉世界充满了温暖。\n\n这次，你说出来放弃之后，我就在犹豫是不是我表达的太多，而忽视了某些细节，细细想来，也许是我忽视了你的感受，那些微妙的感受，也正是爱情中美好的部分。谈恋爱说到底就是寻找两个人都舒服的相处方式，灵魂伴侣也好，精神伴侣也好，肉体伴侣也好，只有在相处之后才会知道是否合适。我现在希望能够说服你陪我一起走下去，一起度过漫漫人生，一起携手相伴。\n\n你从来没有表达过对我的喜欢之情，这就是你的性格，你总觉得表达会难为情，我能理解。我唯一不能理解的是，你总是隔段时间就会消失一段时间，是联系不上的那种消失，大概真的是因为我没有谈过恋爱所以不能理解这种行为吧。如果是因为法考消失，那还好，法考的次数是有限的。如果是因为国考消失，那也还好，国考的次数也是有限的。可是因为生理期消失，虽然不知道你是不是真的因为这个，但是生理期可是每月一次的，难道你要每个月都消失一次，一年算起来有四分之一的时间会消失？想想都觉得可怕。这才是让我奔溃的原因，再加上，你从来没有表达过对我的喜欢，我就陷入了深深的怀疑，是不是我哪儿做错了，是不是我哪儿做的不对，是不是还发生了什么别的事情，那个时候，我可是在热情地思念着你的，热烈的期盼你也能对我表达一次爱意，就这样，热情的火遇到了凛冽的寒冰，也不知道有多少人是能坚持的住的。\n\n就在我以为我坚持了下来的时候，我却被告知，某人对我不满意，要解除合约，有那么好几刻，我是恨你的，回头冷静下来，我该开始反思自己过去的行为了，错并不在你，我也是参与方，我也有错，甚至也许错全在我这里。是我贸然对你表达的喜欢，是我贸然拉近了我们的距离，是我对你作出了那么多的承诺，是我在明知异地的情况下还要那么热烈地追求着你，一切都是起于我。\n\n# 回忆\n\n记得刚开始的时候，你对我是拒绝的，也算是经过了蛮长的拉扯，我也说过要放弃的话。现在我可以坦诚地说，那些要放弃的话，只是一种策略，一种让你放下包袱来认真理解彼此的一种策略。否则，一个多年不见的老同学，见了一次面就跑去说喜欢这种话，搁我身上，我也不会信的，一个随便就说出我喜欢你这种话的人，又能有多大的信任度呢？那天表白的时候，本来打算电话表白的，可是你总是选择不接我电话，是啊，从那个时候，你就喜欢不接我的电话，也经常消失。也想过跑去西安对你表白，你也总是拒绝我的出现，我怕贸然跑过去，会显得很尴尬。所以，最后是在微信上表白的，到现在我都还是觉得蛮遗憾的，我欠你一个浪漫的开场，一度想补上，机会就溜走了那么多，那么多。\n\n我跑去找你的次数，依然屈指可数，正因为屈指可数，才显得弥足珍贵，可是你总是“凶巴巴”地拒绝我的出现，我连吵架都不会，所以之前你每次凶我的时候，我都选择避让，然后旁边配一个可怜巴巴地表情。现在，我渐渐开始理解，其实凶巴巴，那并不是真的你，那只是你的一部分，那只是你的一种表达方式，只要是表达方式就无关好坏，对方理解了就行，我想我现在开始理解你了。还记得那个我误机的夜晚吗？在分别前特别想抱一下你，当我靠近你的时候，你一句“不要碰我”，把我吓回去了，所以到最后都没有给你一个结实的拥抱，特别后悔为什么不强行抱你一下，我想我是怕被当作流氓被打一顿吧。所以那晚在我误机之后，我又跑回市区去了，打了那个假装要放弃的电话。\n\n你是我遇见的第一个对对方有异性朋友那么在意的人，这也是你一度想答应我，但是又没有答应我的原因。我不太确定我能够能否足够理解这种想法，我一直认为有这种想法的人，只要给予足够多的信任，分享相互的朋友圈，随时报备，多表达，多沟通，给你看我的手机，你就会放下这种芥蒂，但现在看来是失败的方式。这些行为并没有打消你的顾虑，反而加重了你对我的不信任感，这的确让我意外。难道这些行为并不是因为不自信，而是因为控制欲？不是因为害怕对方被异性朋友抢走，而是证明对方为自己一人所有？可是我的心也的确是为你一个人所拥有啊？我甚至在你还没有明确答应我的时候，遇到异性我会宣称我有女朋友，冒着有可能丢脸的风险，也要帮你宣誓主权。可说到底，你没有对我说过“你只想一个人拥有我”这种话，所以我很困惑，我又该怎么办呢？\n\n这个世界上没有人可以解答我的困惑，除了你。除了你没有别人，只有你把你的心中所想表达出来，如果我做的不对，也只有你才能为我指出来，这个世界没有人不会犯错，携手才能共进，同步才有共创美好。你总是轻易地说出放弃这种话，是啊，痛苦的爱情谁愿意坚持下去。但是我们之间为什么就一定是痛苦的爱情，出了问题为什么不是通过沟通来解决的呢？为什么第一选项就一定要是放弃呢？过去几个月，我努力展现的是多样的我自己，我有很多面，我想你也有所发现了，来谈恋爱吧，在这里你可以体验那么多的恋爱。\n\n人都是分阶段成长的，爱情也是。当初你的那种直率，纯真，可爱依然吸引着我，我也坚信我并没有选错，只是在中间有些细节跑偏了。不知道我给你留下的好感，还存在多少，无论存在多少，我都希望能够继续增加这种好感，而不是抹杀这些好感，恋爱就是要一起共同成长。我记得和你说过，喜欢就要表达出来，那是因为我害怕不表达出来，就错失了表达的机会。我每天的“我喜欢你”就是对平白开场的一种弥补，也是一种爱意溢出来的真诚。\n\n我喜欢你，只要有机会，我就想对你说一次，如果可以的话，我希望能够对你说千万次，亿万次，希望能够在余生的光辉中对你的喜欢永不停止。\n\n友情提示，本公众号，可以在后台回复单字“冉”获取精彩回答。\n","source":"_drafts/告白.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

过去几个月的阅读内容\n本来在去年年底（即2017年）的时候，打算写一篇过去一年的总结的，但是写了一半，戛然而止，写不下去，这就是对那段时间自己心态的完美总结，在仔细思索了两个月后，虽然中间也让自己放纵了一段时间，我决定在年后（今天是2018年2月26，节后正式上班的第一天）写点儿什么东西，否则郁积在心中又会被我拖延下去，了无尽头。本来打算分好几篇文章来写的，但是最近两个月读的几本书，都没有足够的精力去把他们变成一篇很长的文章，所以就简短地介绍一些自己看完这几本书之后想到的一些问题吧，后面想到了不错的主题再单独另开一篇文章吧。\n\n今年1月份，看了两本书，一本书是《繁荣的代价》，一本书是《以读攻读》。\n\n第一本举了一些例子来证明繁荣所导致的通病，通篇提供的都是描述繁荣所引发的现象，我原本以为，我会在这本书中看到关于儒家文化的思考，但是很遗憾，他只举了一个日本明治维新的例子，日本在明治维新之后，依然保存了大娘原本的文化，观察现象本来就是好的，虽然本书没有提供关于这些现象很深入的探究，但是总结观察到的现象也的确是能够帮我们去引发思考。繁荣的通病总是有那么多，比如繁荣导致低生育率，低生育率导致人口减少，人口减少之后就需要移民来填充，移民多了之后就无法保持国家民族的向心力，虽然这个现象貌似在我们过往的岁月里出现的少，但是这就是繁荣有可能导致，比如日本现在的人口就在减少，但是他们没有奔溃，有关键的一点，觉得应该是因为移民少，所以民族的向心力还在，虽然青壮年的劳动力减少，但是经济增长的点依然存在，所以他们现在依然是GDP第三。所以关于我们自己今后的走向，是否有所启迪呢？再看。\n\n第二本书是一个英文教授[但汉松](https://weibo.com/p/1005051769741763)写过的一些书评，然后出了一个总的合集，写的蛮不错的，关于文学理论方面于我而言可能也就是稍稍涉足一下吧。\n\n2月，很遗憾，只读完了一本书《春之祭-第一次世界大战和现代的开端》，因为过年回家，所以补了很多旧番，比如《少女终末旅行》、《狂赌之渊》、《东京食尸鬼》、《野良神》，不再次赘述。\n\n《春之祭》，原本是一部芭蕾舞剧，首演于1913年（也就是第一次大战的前一年），当即引发了巨大的争议和褒奖，批判与内省就成了一个现代艺术的一个巨大引子，德国的宣战也不是为了侵犯别人的土地，只是为了防御别人的进攻，并且打击英法（是那种瞧不起的争斗，而不是为了攫取利益），他们相互鄙视，但是也会有在开战后相互跑到对方的阵地去庆祝圣诞节。这就是一战，存在主义，虚无主义，达达主义，一切关于现代主义的开始都来自那个时代的斗争中，一战结束后，英国的工党开始强大起来，很多我们现在所熟悉观念开始诞生与演化，德国极权下的无政府主义开始生根发芽，开始有了法西斯主义，开始有了二战。历史总是有迹可循的，历史总是背离我们，也总是在影响我们，我们究竟是不是还要走一样的路呢？我们现在这个国家不是和二战后的德国的政府形式很像吗，也许只是我才疏学浅，看不透吧。\n\n# 关于职业发展的问题\n除此之外，便是关于现在自己的职业生涯路怎么走的问题。我究竟要做什么，如何做，没人会给我一个良好的回答，这个回答究竟是什么，每每想到这里我就宁愿停笔不写，可是问题依然还是存在的，并不会因为我不作为就不存在了。\n\n互联网是什么呢？在我的理解中，互联网本质上是人的连接，打破这种连接，缔结新的连接，这就是互联网。要做好一个互联网产品，产品、技术、运营、交互设计，缺一不可，现在已经过了随随便便就能获取大量用户的时代了，这些东西就显得尤为重要了。如果做好一个公司呢？公司的组织架构、薪酬体系、舵手的魄力与远见、合适的工作氛围，这些东西能够帮助公司走的很远，做的很大，究竟该如何去做，做到何种程度，依然没有一个思考的结果，坐而论道不如起而远行。如何才是一个良好的做事方式呢？期望管理、问题分析方法等等，又有那些是适合我自己的呢？说到底，于我而言，这些东西还是不存在一个是否合适的问题，因为能够完全由我决定的东西还是太少了，如论如何，走下去，也便只能言尽于此了。\n","source":"_posts/2018-02-26.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

He was a boy then, and bastard born, no fit consort for a princess of Dorne, he should have known better.  And it was my father’s will, not mine.  The rest of her companions she hardly knew at all.    \n\nArianne missed her friends.  Drey and Garin and her sweet Spotted Slyva had been a part of her since she was little, trusted confidants who had shared her dreams and secrets, cheered her when she was sad, helped her face her fears.  One of them had betrayed her, but she missed them all the same.  It was my own fault.  Arianne had made them part of her plot to steal off with Myrcella Baratheon and crown her queen, an act of rebellion meant to force her father’s hand, but someone’s loose tongue had undone her.  The clumsy conspiracy had accomplished nothing, except to cost poor Myrcella part of her face, and Ser Arys Oakheart his life.\n\nArianne missed Ser Arys too, more than she ever would have thought.  He loved me madly, she told herself, yet I was never more than fond of him.  I made use of him in mybed and in my plot, took his love and took his honor, gave him nothing but my body.  In the end he could not live with what we’d done.  Why else would her white knight have charged right into Areo Hotah’s longaxe, to die the way he did?  I was a foolish willful girl, playing at the game of thrones like a drunkard rolling dice.  \n\nThe cost of her folly had been dear.  Drey had been sent across the world to Norvos, Garin exiled to Tyrosh for two years, her sweet silly smiling Slyva married off to Eldon Estermont, a man old enough to be her grandsire.  Ser Arys had paid with his life’s blood, Myrcella with an ear.  \n\nOnly Ser Gerold Dayne had escaped unscathed.  Darkstar.  If Myrcella’s horse had not shied at the last instant, his longsword would have opened her from chest to waist instead just taking off her ear.  Dayne was her most grievous sin, the one that Arianne most regretted.  With one stroke of his sword, he had changed her botched plot into something foul and bloody.  If the gods were good, by now Obara Sand had treed him in his mountain fastness and put an end to him.\n\nShe said as much to Daemon Sand that first night, as they made camp.  \"Be careful what you pray for, princess,\" he replied.  \"Darkstar could put an end to Lady Obara just as easily.\"\n\n\"She has Areo Hotah with her.\"  Prince Doran’s captain of guards had dispatched Ser Arys Oakheart with a single blow, though the Kingsguard were supposed to be the finest knights in all the realm.  \"No man can stand against Hotah.\"\n\n\"Is that what Darkstar is?  A man?\"  Ser Daemon grimaced.  \"A man would not have done what he did to Princess Myrcella.  Ser Gerold is more a viper than your uncle ever was.  Prince Oberyn could see that he was poison, he said so more than once.  It’s just a pity that he never got around to killing him.\"\n\nPoison, thought Arianne.  Yes.  Pretty poison, though.  That was how he’d fooled her.  Gerold Dayne was hard and cruel, but so fair to look upon that the princess had not believed half the tales she’d heard of him.  Pretty boys had ever been her weakness, particularly the ones who were dark and dangerous as well.  That was before, when I was just a girl, she told herself.  I am a woman now, my father’s daughter.  I have learned that lesson.\n\nCome break of day, they were off again.  Elia Sand led the way, her black braid flying behind her as she raced across the dry, cracked plains and up into the hills.  The girl was mad for horses, which might be why she often smelled like one, to the despair of her mother.  Sometimes Arianne felt sorry for Ellaria.  Four girls, and every one of them her father’s daughter.  \n\nThe rest of the party kept a more sedate pace.  The princess found herself riding beside Ser Daemon, remembering other rides when they were younger, rides that often ended in embraces.  When she found herself stealing glances at him, tall and gallant in the saddle, Arianne reminded herself that she was heir to Dorne, and him no more than her shield.  \"Tell me what you know of this Jon Connington,\" she commanded.\n\n\"He’s dead,\" said Daemon Sand.  \"He died in the Disputed Lands.  Of drink, I’ve heard it said.\"      \n\n\"So a dead drunk leads this army?\"\n\n\"Perhaps this Jon Connington is a son of that one.  Or just some clever sellsword who has taken on a dead man’s name.\"\n\n\"Or he never died at all.\"  Could Connington have been pretending to be dead for all these years?  That would require patience worthy of her father.  The thought made Arianne uneasy.  Treating with a man that subtle could be perilous.  \"What was he like before he… before he died?\"\n\n\"I was a boy at Godsgrace when he was sent into exile.  I never knew the man.\"\n\n\"Then tell me what you’ve heard of him from others.\"\n\n\"As my princess commands.  Connington was Lord of Griffin’s Roost when Griffin’s Roost was still a lordship worth the having.  Prince Rhaegar’s squire, or one of them.  Later Prince Rhaegar’s friend and companion.  The Mad King named him Hand during Robert’s Rebellion, but he was defeated at Stoney Sept in the Battle of the Bells, and Robert slipped away.  King Aerys was wroth, and sent Connington into exile.  There he died.\"\n\n\"Or not.\"  Prince Doran had told her all of that.  There must be more.  \"Those are just the things he did.  I know all that.  What sort of man was he?  Honest and honorable, venal and grasping, proud?\"\n\n\"Proud, for a certainty.  Even arrogant.  A faithful friend to Rhaegar, but prickly with others.  Robert was his liege, but I’ve heard it said that Connington chafed at serving such a lord.  Even then, Robert was known to be fond of wine and whores.\"\n\n\"No whores for Lord Jon, then?\"\n\n\"I could not say.  Some men keep their whoring secret.\"\n\n\"Did he have a wife?  A paramour?\"\n\nSer Daemon shrugged.  \"Not that I have ever heard.\"\n\nThat was troubling too.  Ser Arys Oakheart had broken his vows for her, but it did not sound as if Jon Connington could be similarly swayed.  Can I match such a man with words alone?\n\nThe princess lapsed into silence, all the while pondering what she would find at journey’s end.  That night when they made camp, she crept into the tent she shared with Jayne Ladybright and Elia Sand and slipped the bit of parchment out of her sleeve to read the words again.\n\n>*To Prince Doran of House Martell,*  \n{% centerquote %}\nYou will remember me, I pray.I knew your sister well,and was a leal servant of your good-brother.I grieve for them as you do.I did not die, no more than did your sister’s son.To save his life we kept him hidden,but the time for hiding is done.  A dragon has returned to Westeros to claim his birthright and seek vengeance for his father, and for the princess Elia, his mother.In her name I turn to Dorne.Do not forsake us.{% endcenterquote %}\n>Jon Connington  \n>Lord of Griffin’s Roost  \n>Hand of the True King\n\n\nArianne read the letter thrice, then rolled it up and tucked it back into her sleeve.  A dragon has returned to Westeros, but not the dragon my father was expecting.  Nowhere in the words was there a mention of Daenerys Stormborn… nor of Prince Quentyn, her brother, who had been sent to seek the dragon queen.  The princess remembered how her father had pressed the onyx cyvasse piece into her palm, his voice hoarse and low as he confessed his plan.  A long and perilous voyage, with an uncertain welcome at its end, he had said.  He has gone to bring us back our heart’s desire.  Vengeance.  Justice.  Fire and blood.\n\nFire and blood was what Jon Connington (if indeed it was him) was offering as well.  Or was it?  \"He comes with sellswords, but no dragons,\" Prince Doran had told her, the night the raven came.  \"The Golden Company is the best and largest of the free companies, but ten thousand mercenaries cannot hope to win the Seven Kingdoms.  Elia’s son… I would weep for joy if some part of my sister had survived, but what proof do we have that this is Aegon?\"  His voice broke when he said that.  \"Where are the dragons?\" he asked.  \"Where is Daenerys?\" and Arianne knew that he was really saying, \"Where is my son?\"\n\nIn the Boneway and the Prince’s Pass, two Dornish hosts had massed, and there they sat, sharpening their spears, polishing their armor, dicing, drinking, quarreling, their numbers dwindling by the day, waiting, waiting, waiting for the Prince of Dorne to loose them on the enemies of House Martell.  Waiting for the dragons.  For fire and blood.  For me.  One word from Arianne and those armies would march… so long as that word wasdragon.  If instead the word she sent was war, Lord Yronwood and Lord Fowler and their armies would remain in place.  The Prince of Dorne was nothing if not subtle; here warmeant wait.  \n\nAt mid-morning on the third day Ghost Hill loomed up before them, its chalk-white walls shining against the deep blue of the Sea of Dorne.  From the square towers at the castle’s corners flew the banners of House Toland; a green dragon biting its own tail, upon a golden field.  The sun-and-spear of House Martell streamed atop the great central keep, gold and red and orange, defiant.\n\nRavens had flown ahead to warn Lady Toland of their coming, so the castle gates were open, and Nymella’s eldest daughter rode forth with her steward to meet them near the bottom of the hill.  Tall and fierce, with a blaze of bright red hair tumbling about her shoulders, Valena Toland greeted Arianne with a shout of, \"Come at last, have you?  How slow are those horses?\"\n\n\"Swift enough to outrun yours to the castle gates.\"    \n\n\"We will see about that.\"  Valena wheeled her big red around and put her heels into him, and the race was on, through the dusty lanes of the village at the bottom of the hill, as chickens and villagers alike scrambled out of their path.  Arianne was three horse lengths behind by the time she got her mare up to a gallop, but had closed to one halfway up the slope.  The two of them were side-by-side as they thundered towards the gatehouse, but five yards from the gates Elia Sand came flying from the cloud of dust behind them to rush past both of them on her black filly.\n\n\"Are you half horse, child?\" Valena asked, laughing, in the yard.  \"Princess, did you bring a stable girl?\"\n\n\"I’m Elia,\" the girl announced.  \"Lady Lance.\"\n\nWhoever hung that name on her has much to answer for.  Like as not it had been Prince Oberyn, though, and the Red Viper had never answered to anyone but himself.\n\n\"The girl jouster,\" Valena said.  \"Yes, I’ve heard of you.  Since you were the first to the yard, you’ve won the honor of watering and bridling the horses.\"\n\n\"And after that find the bath house,\" said Princess Arianne.  Elia was chalk and dust from heels to hair.  \n\nThat night Arianne and her knights supped with Lady Nymella and her daughters in the great hall of the castle.  Teora, the younger girl, had the same red hair as her sister, but elsewise could not have been more different.  Short, plump, and so shy she might have passed for a mute, she displayed more interest in the spiced beef and honeyed duck than in the comely young knights at the table, and seemed content to let her lady mother and her sister speak for House Toland.  \n\n\"We have heard the same tales here that you have heard at Sunspear,\" Lady Nymella told them as her serving man poured the wine.  \"Sellswords landing on Cape Wrath, castles under siege or being taken, crops seized or burned.  Where these men come from and who they are, no one is certain.\"\n\n\"Pirates and adventurers, we heard at first,\" said Valena.  \"Then it was supposed to be the Golden Company.  Now it’s said to be Jon Connington, the Mad King’s Hand, come back from the grave to reclaim his birthright.  Whoever it is, Griffin’s Roost has fallen to them.  Rain House, Crow’s Nest, Mistwood, even Greenstone on its island.  All taken.\"\n\nArianne’s thoughts went at once to her sweet Spotted Slyva.  \"Who would want Greenstone?  Was there a battle?\"\n\n\"Not as we have heard, but all the tales are garbled.\"\n\n\"Tarth has fallen too, some fisherfolk will tell you,\" said Valena.  \"These sellswords now hold most of Cape Wrath and half the Stepstones.  We hear talk of elephants in the rainwood.\"\n\n\"Elephants?\"  Arianne did not know what to think of that.  \"Are you certain?  Not dragons?\"\n\n\"Elephants,\" Lady Nymella said firmly.\n\n\"And krakens off the Broken Arm, pulling under crippled galleys,\" said Valena.  \"The blood draws them to the surface, our maester claims.  There are bodies in the water.  A few have washed up on our shores.  And that’s not half of it.  A new pirate king has set up on Torturer’s Deep.  The Lord of the Waters, he styles himself.  This one has real warships, three-deckers, monstrous large.  You were wise not to come by sea.  Since the Redwyne fleet passed through the Stepstones, those waters are crawling with strange sails, all the way north to the Straights of Tarth and Shipbreaker’s Bay.  Myrmen, Volantenes, Lyseni, even reavers from the Iron Islands.  Some have entered the Sea of Dorne to land men on the south shore of Cape Wrath.  We found a good fast ship for you, as your father commanded, but even so… be careful.\"\n\nIt is true, then.  Arianne wanted to ask after her brother, but her father had urged her to watch every word.  If these ships had not brought Quentyn home again with his dragon queen, best not to mention him.  Only her father and a few of his most trusted men knew about her brother’s mission to Slaver’s Bay.  Lady Toland and her daughters were not amongst them.  If it were Quentyn, he would have brought Daenerys back to Dorne, surely.  Why would he risk a landing on Cape Wrath, amongst the stormlords?  \n\n\"Is Dorne at risk?\" Lady Nymella asked.  \"I confess, each time I see a strange sail my heart leaps to my throat.  What if these ships turn south?  The best part of the Toland strength is with Lord Yronwood in the Boneway.  Who will defend Ghost Hill if these strangers land upon our shores?  Should I call my men home?\"\n\n\"Your men are needed where they are, my lady,\" Daemon Sand assured her.  Arianne was quick to nod.  Any other counsel could well lead to Lord Yronwood’s host unravelling like an old tapestry as each man rushed home to defend his own lands against supposed enemies who might or might not ever come.  \"Once we know beyond a doubt whether these be friends or foes, my father will know what to do,\" the princess said.\n\nIt was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the creamcakes on her plate.  \"It is dragons.\"      \n\n\"Dragons?\"  said her mother.  \"Teora, don’t be mad.\"\n\n\"I’m not.  They’re coming.\"\n\n\"How could you possibly know that?\" her sister asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.\n\n\"One of your little dreams?\"\n\nTeora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling.  \"They were dancing.  In my dream.  And everywhere the dragons danced the people died.\"\n\n\"Seven save us.\"  Lady Nymella gave an exasperated sigh.\n\n\"If you did not eat so many creamcakes you would not have such dreams.  Rich foods are not for girls your age, when your humors are so unbalanced.  Maester Toman says — \"\n\n\"I hate Maester Toman,\" Teora said.  Then she bolted from the table, leaving her lady mother to make apologies for her.\n\n\"Be gentle with her, my lady,\" Arianne said.  \"I remember when I was her age.  My father despaired of me, I’m sure.\"  \n\n\"I can attest to that.\"  Ser Daemon took a sip of wine and said, \"House Toland has a dragon on its banners.\"  \n\n\"A dragon eating its own tail, aye,\" Valena said.  \"From the days of Aegon’s Conquest.  He did not conquer here.  Elsewhere he burned his foes, him and his sisters, but here we melted away before them, leaving only stone and sand for them to burn.  And round and round the dragons went, snapping at their tails for want of any other food, till they were tied in knots.\"\n\n\"Our forebears played their part in that,\" Lady Nymella said proudly.  \"Bold deeds were done, and brave men died.  All of it was written down by the maesters who served us.  We have books, if my princess would like to know more.\"\n\n\"Some other time, perhaps,\" said Arianne.\n\nAs Ghost Hill slept that night, the princess donned a hooded cloak against the chill and and walked the castle battlements to clear her thoughts.  Daemon Sand found her leaning on a parapet and gazing out to sea, where the moon was dancing on the water.  \"Princess,\" he said.  \"You ought to be abed.\"\n\n\"I could say the same of you.\"  Arianne turned to gaze upon his face.  A good face, she decided.  The boy I knew has become a handsome man.  His eyes were as blue as a desert sky, his hair the light brown of the sands they had just crossed.  A close-cropped beard followed the thin of a strong jaw, but could not quite hide the dimples when he smiled.  I always loved his smile.\n\nThe Bastard of Godsgrace was one of Dorne’s finest swords as well, as might be expected from one who had been Prince Oberyn’s squire and had received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself.  Some said that he had been her uncle’s lover too, though seldom to his face.  Arianne did not know the truth of that.  He had been her lover, though.  At fourteen she had given him her maidenhead.  Daemon had not been much older, so their couplings had been as clumsy as they were ardent.  Still, it had been sweet.  \n\nArianne gave him her most seductive smile.  \"We might share a bed together.\"\n\nSer Daemon’s face was stone.  \"Have you forgotten, princess?  I am bastard born.\"  He took her hand in his.  \"If I am unworthy of this hand, how can I be worthy of your cunt?\"\n\nShe snatched her hand away.  \"You deserve a slap for that.\"  \n\n\"My face is yours.  Do what you will.\"\n\n\"What I will you will not, it seems.  So be it.  Talk with me instead.  Could this truly be Prince Aegon?\"\n\n\"Gregor Clegane ripped Aegon out of Elia’s arms and smashed his head against a wall,\" Ser Daemon said.  \"If Lord Connington’s prince has a crushed skull, I will believe that Aegon Targaryen has returned from the grave.  Elsewise, no.  This is some feigned boy, no more.  A sellsword’s ploy to win support.\"\n\nMy father fears the same.  \"If not, though… if this truly is Jon Connington, if the boy is Rhaegar’s son… \"\n\n\"Are you hoping that he is, or that he’s not?\"\n\n\"I… it would give great joy to my father if Elia’s son were still alive.  He loved his sister well.\"\n\n\"It was you I asked about, not your father.\"\n\nSo it was.  \"I was seven when Elia died.  They say I held her daughter Rhaenys once, when I was too young to remember.  Aegon will be a stranger to me, whether true or false.\"  The princess paused.  \"We looked for Rhaegar’s sister, not his son.\"  Her father had confided in Ser Daemon when he chose him as his daughter’s shield; with him at least she could speak freely.  \"I would sooner it were Quentyn who’d returned.\"\n\n\"Or so you say,\" said Daemon Sand.  \"Good night, princess.\"  He bowed to her, and left her standing there.\n\nWhat did he mean by that?  Arianne watched him walk away.  What sort of sister would I be, if I did not want my brother back?  It was true, she had resented Quentyn for all those years that she had thought their father meant to name him as his heir in place of her, but that had turned out to be just a misunderstanding.  She was the heir to Dorne, she had her father’s word on that.  Quentyn would have his dragon queen, Daenerys.\n\nIn Sunspear hung a portrait of the Princess Daenerys who had come to Dorne to marry one of Arianne’s forebears.  In her younger days Arianne had spent hours gazing at it, back when she was just a pudgy flat-chested girl on the cusp of maidenhood who prayed every night for the gods to make her pretty.  A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace.  Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort.King Quentyn.  Why did that sound so silly?  \n\nAlmost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.  Her brother was an earnest boy,well-behaved and dutiful, but dull.  And plain, so plain.  The gods had given Arianne the beauty she had prayed for, but Quentyn must have prayed for something else.  His head was overlarge and sort of square, his hair the color of dried mud.  His shoulders slumped as well, and he was too thick about the middle.  He looks too much like Father.\n\n\"I love my brother,\" said Arianne, though only the moon could hear her.  Though if truth be told, she scarcely knew him.  Quentyn had been fostered by Lord Anders of House Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, the son of Lord Ormond Yronwood and grandson of Lord Edgar.  In his youth her uncle Oberyn had fought a duel with Edgar, had given him a wound that mortified and killed him.  Afterward men called him ‘the Red Viper,’ and spoke of poison on his blade.  The Yronwoods were an ancient house, proud and powerful.  Before the coming of the Rhoynar they had been kings over half of Dorne, with domains that dwarfed those of House Martell.  Blood feud and rebellion would surely have followed Lord Edgar’s death, had not her father acted at once.  The Red Viper went to Oldtown, thence across to the narrow sea to Lys, though none dared call it exile.  And in due time, Quentyn was given to Lord Anders to foster as a sign of trust.  That helped to heal the breach between Sunspear and the Yronwoods, but it had opened new ones between Quentyn and the Sand Snakes… and Arianne had always been closer to her cousins than to her distant brother.\n\n\"We are still the same blood, though,\" she whispered.  \"Of course I want my brother home.  I do.\"  The wind off the sea was raising gooseprickles all up and down her arms.  Arianne pulled her cloak about herself, and went off to seek her bed.\n\nTheir ship was called the Peregrine.  They sailed upon the morning tide.  The gods were good to them, the sea calm.  Even with good winds, the crossing took a day and a night.  Jayne Ladybright grew greensick and spent most of the voyage spewing, which Elia Sand seemed to find hilarious.  \"Someone needs to spank that child,\" Joss Hood was heard to say… but Elia was amongst those who heard him say it.\n\n\"I am almost a woman grown, ser,\" she responded haughtily.  \"I’ll let you spank me, though…  but first you’ll need to tilt with me, and knock me off my horse.\"\n\n\"We are on a ship, and without horses,\" Joss replied.\n\n\"And ladies do not joust,\" insisted Ser Garibald Shells, a far more serious and proper young man than his companion.\n\n\"I do.  I’m Lady Lance.\"\n\nArianne had heard enough.  \"You may be a lance, but you are no lady.  Go below and stay there till we reach land.\"\n\nElsewise the crossing was uneventful.  At dusk they spied a galley in the distance, her oars rising and falling against the evening stars, but she was moving away from them, and soon dwindled and was gone.  Arianne played a game of cyvasse with Ser Daemon, and another one with Garibald Shells, and somehow managed to lose both.  Ser Garibald was kind enough to say that she played a gallant game, but Daemon mocked her.  \"You have other pieces beside the dragon, princess.  Try moving them sometime.\"\n\n\"I like the dragon.\"  She wanted to slap the smile off his face.  Or kiss it off, perhaps.  The man was as smug as he was comely.  Of all the knights in Dorne, why did my father chose this one to be my shield?  He knows our history.  \"It is just a game.  Tell me of Prince Viserys.\"\n\n\"The Beggar King?\"  Ser Daemon seemed surprised.  \n\n\"Everyone says that Prince Rhaegar was beautiful.  Was Viserys beautiful as well?\"\n\n\"I suppose.  He was Targaryen.  I never saw the man.\"\n\nThe secret pact that Prince Doran had made all those years called for Arianne to be wed to Prince Viserys, not Quentyn to Daenerys.  It had all come undone on the Dothraki sea, when he was murdered.  Crowned with a pot of molten gold.  \"He was killed by a Dothraki khal,\" said Arianne.  \"The dragon queen’s own husband.\"\n\n\"So I’ve heard.  What of it?\"      \n\n\"Just… why did Daenerys let it happen?  Viserys was her brother.  All that remained of her own blood.\"\n\n\"The Dothraki are a savage folk.  Who can know why they kill?  Perhaps Viserys wiped his arse with the wrong hand.\"\n\nPerhaps, thought Arianne, or perhaps Daenerys realized that once her brother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest of her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse.  \"She is the Mad King’s daughter,\" the princess said.  \"How do we do know — \"\n\n\"We cannot know,\" Ser Daemon said.  \"We can only hope.\"\n","source":"_posts/ARIANNE.md","raw":"---\ntitle: ARIANNE\ndate: 2016-03-31 23:07:07\ntags: 冰与火之歌\ncomments: false\n---\n## ARIANNEE\\--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\n\nThey struck out north by northwest, across drylands and parched plains and pale sands toward Ghost Hill, the stronghold of House Toland, where the ship that would take them across the Sea of Dorne awaited them.  \"Send a raven whenever you have news,\" Prince Doran told her, \"but report only what you know to be true.  We are lost in fog here, besieged by rumors, falsehoods, and traveler’s tales.  I dare not act until I know for a certainty what is happening.\"\n\nWar is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be spared.  \"Doom and death are coming,\" Ellaria Sand had warned them, before she took her own leave from Prince Doran.  \"It is time for my little snakes to scatter, the better to survive the carnage.\"  Ellaria was returning to her father’s seat at Hellholt.  With her went her daughter Loreza, who had just turned seven.  Dorea remained at the Water Gardens, one child amongst a hundred.Obella was to be dispatched to Sunspear, to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of the castellan, Manfrey Martell.\n<!-- more -->\nAnd Elia Sand, oldest of the four girls that Prince Oberyn had fathered on Ellaria, would cross the Sea of Dorne with Arianne.  \"As a lady, not a lance,\" her mother said firmly, but like all the Sand Snakes, Elia had her own mind.\n\nThey crossed the sands in two long days and the better part of two nights, stopping thrice to change their horses.  It was a lonely time for Arianne, surrounded by so many strangers.  Elia was her cousin, but half a child, and Daemon Sand… things had never been the same between her and the Bastard of Godsgrace after her father refused his offer for her hand.  He was a boy then, and bastard born, no fit consort for a princess of Dorne, he should have known better.  And it was my father’s will, not mine.  The rest of her companions she hardly knew at all.    \n\nArianne missed her friends.  Drey and Garin and her sweet Spotted Slyva had been a part of her since she was little, trusted confidants who had shared her dreams and secrets, cheered her when she was sad, helped her face her fears.  One of them had betrayed her, but she missed them all the same.  It was my own fault.  Arianne had made them part of her plot to steal off with Myrcella Baratheon and crown her queen, an act of rebellion meant to force her father’s hand, but someone’s loose tongue had undone her.  The clumsy conspiracy had accomplished nothing, except to cost poor Myrcella part of her face, and Ser Arys Oakheart his life.\n\nArianne missed Ser Arys too, more than she ever would have thought.  He loved me madly, she told herself, yet I was never more than fond of him.  I made use of him in mybed and in my plot, took his love and took his honor, gave him nothing but my body.  In the end he could not live with what we’d done.  Why else would her white knight have charged right into Areo Hotah’s longaxe, to die the way he did?  I was a foolish willful girl, playing at the game of thrones like a drunkard rolling dice.  \n\nThe cost of her folly had been dear.  Drey had been sent across the world to Norvos, Garin exiled to Tyrosh for two years, her sweet silly smiling Slyva married off to Eldon Estermont, a man old enough to be her grandsire.  Ser Arys had paid with his life’s blood, Myrcella with an ear.  \n\nOnly Ser Gerold Dayne had escaped unscathed.  Darkstar.  If Myrcella’s horse had not shied at the last instant, his longsword would have opened her from chest to waist instead just taking off her ear.  Dayne was her most grievous sin, the one that Arianne most regretted.  With one stroke of his sword, he had changed her botched plot into something foul and bloody.  If the gods were good, by now Obara Sand had treed him in his mountain fastness and put an end to him.\n\nShe said as much to Daemon Sand that first night, as they made camp.  \"Be careful what you pray for, princess,\" he replied.  \"Darkstar could put an end to Lady Obara just as easily.\"\n\n\"She has Areo Hotah with her.\"  Prince Doran’s captain of guards had dispatched Ser Arys Oakheart with a single blow, though the Kingsguard were supposed to be the finest knights in all the realm.  \"No man can stand against Hotah.\"\n\n\"Is that what Darkstar is?  A man?\"  Ser Daemon grimaced.  \"A man would not have done what he did to Princess Myrcella.  Ser Gerold is more a viper than your uncle ever was.  Prince Oberyn could see that he was poison, he said so more than once.  It’s just a pity that he never got around to killing him.\"\n\nPoison, thought Arianne.  Yes.  Pretty poison, though.  That was how he’d fooled her.  Gerold Dayne was hard and cruel, but so fair to look upon that the princess had not believed half the tales she’d heard of him.  Pretty boys had ever been her weakness, particularly the ones who were dark and dangerous as well.  That was before, when I was just a girl, she told herself.  I am a woman now, my father’s daughter.  I have learned that lesson.\n\nCome break of day, they were off again.  Elia Sand led the way, her black braid flying behind her as she raced across the dry, cracked plains and up into the hills.  The girl was mad for horses, which might be why she often smelled like one, to the despair of her mother.  Sometimes Arianne felt sorry for Ellaria.  Four girls, and every one of them her father’s daughter.  \n\nThe rest of the party kept a more sedate pace.  The princess found herself riding beside Ser Daemon, remembering other rides when they were younger, rides that often ended in embraces.  When she found herself stealing glances at him, tall and gallant in the saddle, Arianne reminded herself that she was heir to Dorne, and him no more than her shield.  \"Tell me what you know of this Jon Connington,\" she commanded.\n\n\"He’s dead,\" said Daemon Sand.  \"He died in the Disputed Lands.  Of drink, I’ve heard it said.\"      \n\n\"So a dead drunk leads this army?\"\n\n\"Perhaps this Jon Connington is a son of that one.  Or just some clever sellsword who has taken on a dead man’s name.\"\n\n\"Or he never died at all.\"  Could Connington have been pretending to be dead for all these years?  That would require patience worthy of her father.  The thought made Arianne uneasy.  Treating with a man that subtle could be perilous.  \"What was he like before he… before he died?\"\n\n\"I was a boy at Godsgrace when he was sent into exile.  I never knew the man.\"\n\n\"Then tell me what you’ve heard of him from others.\"\n\n\"As my princess commands.  Connington was Lord of Griffin’s Roost when Griffin’s Roost was still a lordship worth the having.  Prince Rhaegar’s squire, or one of them.  Later Prince Rhaegar’s friend and companion.  The Mad King named him Hand during Robert’s Rebellion, but he was defeated at Stoney Sept in the Battle of the Bells, and Robert slipped away.  King Aerys was wroth, and sent Connington into exile.  There he died.\"\n\n\"Or not.\"  Prince Doran had told her all of that.  There must be more.  \"Those are just the things he did.  I know all that.  What sort of man was he?  Honest and honorable, venal and grasping, proud?\"\n\n\"Proud, for a certainty.  Even arrogant.  A faithful friend to Rhaegar, but prickly with others.  Robert was his liege, but I’ve heard it said that Connington chafed at serving such a lord.  Even then, Robert was known to be fond of wine and whores.\"\n\n\"No whores for Lord Jon, then?\"\n\n\"I could not say.  Some men keep their whoring secret.\"\n\n\"Did he have a wife?  A paramour?\"\n\nSer Daemon shrugged.  \"Not that I have ever heard.\"\n\nThat was troubling too.  Ser Arys Oakheart had broken his vows for her, but it did not sound as if Jon Connington could be similarly swayed.  Can I match such a man with words alone?\n\nThe princess lapsed into silence, all the while pondering what she would find at journey’s end.  That night when they made camp, she crept into the tent she shared with Jayne Ladybright and Elia Sand and slipped the bit of parchment out of her sleeve to read the words again.\n\n>*To Prince Doran of House Martell,*  \n{% centerquote %}\nYou will remember me, I pray.I knew your sister well,and was a leal servant of your good-brother.I grieve for them as you do.I did not die, no more than did your sister’s son.To save his life we kept him hidden,but the time for hiding is done.  A dragon has returned to Westeros to claim his birthright and seek vengeance for his father, and for the princess Elia, his mother.In her name I turn to Dorne.Do not forsake us.{% endcenterquote %}\n>Jon Connington  \n>Lord of Griffin’s Roost  \n>Hand of the True King\n\n\nArianne read the letter thrice, then rolled it up and tucked it back into her sleeve.  A dragon has returned to Westeros, but not the dragon my father was expecting.  Nowhere in the words was there a mention of Daenerys Stormborn… nor of Prince Quentyn, her brother, who had been sent to seek the dragon queen.  The princess remembered how her father had pressed the onyx cyvasse piece into her palm, his voice hoarse and low as he confessed his plan.  A long and perilous voyage, with an uncertain welcome at its end, he had said.  He has gone to bring us back our heart’s desire.  Vengeance.  Justice.  Fire and blood.\n\nFire and blood was what Jon Connington (if indeed it was him) was offering as well.  Or was it?  \"He comes with sellswords, but no dragons,\" Prince Doran had told her, the night the raven came.  \"The Golden Company is the best and largest of the free companies, but ten thousand mercenaries cannot hope to win the Seven Kingdoms.  Elia’s son… I would weep for joy if some part of my sister had survived, but what proof do we have that this is Aegon?\"  His voice broke when he said that.  \"Where are the dragons?\" he asked.  \"Where is Daenerys?\" and Arianne knew that he was really saying, \"Where is my son?\"\n\nIn the Boneway and the Prince’s Pass, two Dornish hosts had massed, and there they sat, sharpening their spears, polishing their armor, dicing, drinking, quarreling, their numbers dwindling by the day, waiting, waiting, waiting for the Prince of Dorne to loose them on the enemies of House Martell.  Waiting for the dragons.  For fire and blood.  For me.  One word from Arianne and those armies would march… so long as that word wasdragon.  If instead the word she sent was war, Lord Yronwood and Lord Fowler and their armies would remain in place.  The Prince of Dorne was nothing if not subtle; here warmeant wait.  \n\nAt mid-morning on the third day Ghost Hill loomed up before them, its chalk-white walls shining against the deep blue of the Sea of Dorne.  From the square towers at the castle’s corners flew the banners of House Toland; a green dragon biting its own tail, upon a golden field.  The sun-and-spear of House Martell streamed atop the great central keep, gold and red and orange, defiant.\n\nRavens had flown ahead to warn Lady Toland of their coming, so the castle gates were open, and Nymella’s eldest daughter rode forth with her steward to meet them near the bottom of the hill.  Tall and fierce, with a blaze of bright red hair tumbling about her shoulders, Valena Toland greeted Arianne with a shout of, \"Come at last, have you?  How slow are those horses?\"\n\n\"Swift enough to outrun yours to the castle gates.\"    \n\n\"We will see about that.\"  Valena wheeled her big red around and put her heels into him, and the race was on, through the dusty lanes of the village at the bottom of the hill, as chickens and villagers alike scrambled out of their path.  Arianne was three horse lengths behind by the time she got her mare up to a gallop, but had closed to one halfway up the slope.  The two of them were side-by-side as they thundered towards the gatehouse, but five yards from the gates Elia Sand came flying from the cloud of dust behind them to rush past both of them on her black filly.\n\n\"Are you half horse, child?\" Valena asked, laughing, in the yard.  \"Princess, did you bring a stable girl?\"\n\n\"I’m Elia,\" the girl announced.  \"Lady Lance.\"\n\nWhoever hung that name on her has much to answer for.  Like as not it had been Prince Oberyn, though, and the Red Viper had never answered to anyone but himself.\n\n\"The girl jouster,\" Valena said.  \"Yes, I’ve heard of you.  Since you were the first to the yard, you’ve won the honor of watering and bridling the horses.\"\n\n\"And after that find the bath house,\" said Princess Arianne.  Elia was chalk and dust from heels to hair.  \n\nThat night Arianne and her knights supped with Lady Nymella and her daughters in the great hall of the castle.  Teora, the younger girl, had the same red hair as her sister, but elsewise could not have been more different.  Short, plump, and so shy she might have passed for a mute, she displayed more interest in the spiced beef and honeyed duck than in the comely young knights at the table, and seemed content to let her lady mother and her sister speak for House Toland.  \n\n\"We have heard the same tales here that you have heard at Sunspear,\" Lady Nymella told them as her serving man poured the wine.  \"Sellswords landing on Cape Wrath, castles under siege or being taken, crops seized or burned.  Where these men come from and who they are, no one is certain.\"\n\n\"Pirates and adventurers, we heard at first,\" said Valena.  \"Then it was supposed to be the Golden Company.  Now it’s said to be Jon Connington, the Mad King’s Hand, come back from the grave to reclaim his birthright.  Whoever it is, Griffin’s Roost has fallen to them.  Rain House, Crow’s Nest, Mistwood, even Greenstone on its island.  All taken.\"\n\nArianne’s thoughts went at once to her sweet Spotted Slyva.  \"Who would want Greenstone?  Was there a battle?\"\n\n\"Not as we have heard, but all the tales are garbled.\"\n\n\"Tarth has fallen too, some fisherfolk will tell you,\" said Valena.  \"These sellswords now hold most of Cape Wrath and half the Stepstones.  We hear talk of elephants in the rainwood.\"\n\n\"Elephants?\"  Arianne did not know what to think of that.  \"Are you certain?  Not dragons?\"\n\n\"Elephants,\" Lady Nymella said firmly.\n\n\"And krakens off the Broken Arm, pulling under crippled galleys,\" said Valena.  \"The blood draws them to the surface, our maester claims.  There are bodies in the water.  A few have washed up on our shores.  And that’s not half of it.  A new pirate king has set up on Torturer’s Deep.  The Lord of the Waters, he styles himself.  This one has real warships, three-deckers, monstrous large.  You were wise not to come by sea.  Since the Redwyne fleet passed through the Stepstones, those waters are crawling with strange sails, all the way north to the Straights of Tarth and Shipbreaker’s Bay.  Myrmen, Volantenes, Lyseni, even reavers from the Iron Islands.  Some have entered the Sea of Dorne to land men on the south shore of Cape Wrath.  We found a good fast ship for you, as your father commanded, but even so… be careful.\"\n\nIt is true, then.  Arianne wanted to ask after her brother, but her father had urged her to watch every word.  If these ships had not brought Quentyn home again with his dragon queen, best not to mention him.  Only her father and a few of his most trusted men knew about her brother’s mission to Slaver’s Bay.  Lady Toland and her daughters were not amongst them.  If it were Quentyn, he would have brought Daenerys back to Dorne, surely.  Why would he risk a landing on Cape Wrath, amongst the stormlords?  \n\n\"Is Dorne at risk?\" Lady Nymella asked.  \"I confess, each time I see a strange sail my heart leaps to my throat.  What if these ships turn south?  The best part of the Toland strength is with Lord Yronwood in the Boneway.  Who will defend Ghost Hill if these strangers land upon our shores?  Should I call my men home?\"\n\n\"Your men are needed where they are, my lady,\" Daemon Sand assured her.  Arianne was quick to nod.  Any other counsel could well lead to Lord Yronwood’s host unravelling like an old tapestry as each man rushed home to defend his own lands against supposed enemies who might or might not ever come.  \"Once we know beyond a doubt whether these be friends or foes, my father will know what to do,\" the princess said.\n\nIt was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the creamcakes on her plate.  \"It is dragons.\"      \n\n\"Dragons?\"  said her mother.  \"Teora, don’t be mad.\"\n\n\"I’m not.  They’re coming.\"\n\n\"How could you possibly know that?\" her sister asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.\n\n\"One of your little dreams?\"\n\nTeora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling.  \"They were dancing.  In my dream.  And everywhere the dragons danced the people died.\"\n\n\"Seven save us.\"  Lady Nymella gave an exasperated sigh.\n\n\"If you did not eat so many creamcakes you would not have such dreams.  Rich foods are not for girls your age, when your humors are so unbalanced.  Maester Toman says — \"\n\n\"I hate Maester Toman,\" Teora said.  Then she bolted from the table, leaving her lady mother to make apologies for her.\n\n\"Be gentle with her, my lady,\" Arianne said.  \"I remember when I was her age.  My father despaired of me, I’m sure.\"  \n\n\"I can attest to that.\"  Ser Daemon took a sip of wine and said, \"House Toland has a dragon on its banners.\"  \n\n\"A dragon eating its own tail, aye,\" Valena said.  \"From the days of Aegon’s Conquest.  He did not conquer here.  Elsewhere he burned his foes, him and his sisters, but here we melted away before them, leaving only stone and sand for them to burn.  And round and round the dragons went, snapping at their tails for want of any other food, till they were tied in knots.\"\n\n\"Our forebears played their part in that,\" Lady Nymella said proudly.  \"Bold deeds were done, and brave men died.  All of it was written down by the maesters who served us.  We have books, if my princess would like to know more.\"\n\n\"Some other time, perhaps,\" said Arianne.\n\nAs Ghost Hill slept that night, the princess donned a hooded cloak against the chill and and walked the castle battlements to clear her thoughts.  Daemon Sand found her leaning on a parapet and gazing out to sea, where the moon was dancing on the water.  \"Princess,\" he said.  \"You ought to be abed.\"\n\n\"I could say the same of you.\"  Arianne turned to gaze upon his face.  A good face, she decided.  The boy I knew has become a handsome man.  His eyes were as blue as a desert sky, his hair the light brown of the sands they had just crossed.  A close-cropped beard followed the thin of a strong jaw, but could not quite hide the dimples when he smiled.  I always loved his smile.\n\nThe Bastard of Godsgrace was one of Dorne’s finest swords as well, as might be expected from one who had been Prince Oberyn’s squire and had received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself.  Some said that he had been her uncle’s lover too, though seldom to his face.  Arianne did not know the truth of that.  He had been her lover, though.  At fourteen she had given him her maidenhead.  Daemon had not been much older, so their couplings had been as clumsy as they were ardent.  Still, it had been sweet.  \n\nArianne gave him her most seductive smile.  \"We might share a bed together.\"\n\nSer Daemon’s face was stone.  \"Have you forgotten, princess?  I am bastard born.\"  He took her hand in his.  \"If I am unworthy of this hand, how can I be worthy of your cunt?\"\n\nShe snatched her hand away.  \"You deserve a slap for that.\"  \n\n\"My face is yours.  Do what you will.\"\n\n\"What I will you will not, it seems.  So be it.  Talk with me instead.  Could this truly be Prince Aegon?\"\n\n\"Gregor Clegane ripped Aegon out of Elia’s arms and smashed his head against a wall,\" Ser Daemon said.  \"If Lord Connington’s prince has a crushed skull, I will believe that Aegon Targaryen has returned from the grave.  Elsewise, no.  This is some feigned boy, no more.  A sellsword’s ploy to win support.\"\n\nMy father fears the same.  \"If not, though… if this truly is Jon Connington, if the boy is Rhaegar’s son… \"\n\n\"Are you hoping that he is, or that he’s not?\"\n\n\"I… it would give great joy to my father if Elia’s son were still alive.  He loved his sister well.\"\n\n\"It was you I asked about, not your father.\"\n\nSo it was.  \"I was seven when Elia died.  They say I held her daughter Rhaenys once, when I was too young to remember.  Aegon will be a stranger to me, whether true or false.\"  The princess paused.  \"We looked for Rhaegar’s sister, not his son.\"  Her father had confided in Ser Daemon when he chose him as his daughter’s shield; with him at least she could speak freely.  \"I would sooner it were Quentyn who’d returned.\"\n\n\"Or so you say,\" said Daemon Sand.  \"Good night, princess.\"  He bowed to her, and left her standing there.\n\nWhat did he mean by that?  Arianne watched him walk away.  What sort of sister would I be, if I did not want my brother back?  It was true, she had resented Quentyn for all those years that she had thought their father meant to name him as his heir in place of her, but that had turned out to be just a misunderstanding.  She was the heir to Dorne, she had her father’s word on that.  Quentyn would have his dragon queen, Daenerys.\n\nIn Sunspear hung a portrait of the Princess Daenerys who had come to Dorne to marry one of Arianne’s forebears.  In her younger days Arianne had spent hours gazing at it, back when she was just a pudgy flat-chested girl on the cusp of maidenhood who prayed every night for the gods to make her pretty.  A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace.  Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort.King Quentyn.  Why did that sound so silly?  \n\nAlmost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.  Her brother was an earnest boy,well-behaved and dutiful, but dull.  And plain, so plain.  The gods had given Arianne the beauty she had prayed for, but Quentyn must have prayed for something else.  His head was overlarge and sort of square, his hair the color of dried mud.  His shoulders slumped as well, and he was too thick about the middle.  He looks too much like Father.\n\n\"I love my brother,\" said Arianne, though only the moon could hear her.  Though if truth be told, she scarcely knew him.  Quentyn had been fostered by Lord Anders of House Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, the son of Lord Ormond Yronwood and grandson of Lord Edgar.  In his youth her uncle Oberyn had fought a duel with Edgar, had given him a wound that mortified and killed him.  Afterward men called him ‘the Red Viper,’ and spoke of poison on his blade.  The Yronwoods were an ancient house, proud and powerful.  Before the coming of the Rhoynar they had been kings over half of Dorne, with domains that dwarfed those of House Martell.  Blood feud and rebellion would surely have followed Lord Edgar’s death, had not her father acted at once.  The Red Viper went to Oldtown, thence across to the narrow sea to Lys, though none dared call it exile.  And in due time, Quentyn was given to Lord Anders to foster as a sign of trust.  That helped to heal the breach between Sunspear and the Yronwoods, but it had opened new ones between Quentyn and the Sand Snakes… and Arianne had always been closer to her cousins than to her distant brother.\n\n\"We are still the same blood, though,\" she whispered.  \"Of course I want my brother home.  I do.\"  The wind off the sea was raising gooseprickles all up and down her arms.  Arianne pulled her cloak about herself, and went off to seek her bed.\n\nTheir ship was called the Peregrine.  They sailed upon the morning tide.  The gods were good to them, the sea calm.  Even with good winds, the crossing took a day and a night.  Jayne Ladybright grew greensick and spent most of the voyage spewing, which Elia Sand seemed to find hilarious.  \"Someone needs to spank that child,\" Joss Hood was heard to say… but Elia was amongst those who heard him say it.\n\n\"I am almost a woman grown, ser,\" she responded haughtily.  \"I’ll let you spank me, though…  but first you’ll need to tilt with me, and knock me off my horse.\"\n\n\"We are on a ship, and without horses,\" Joss replied.\n\n\"And ladies do not joust,\" insisted Ser Garibald Shells, a far more serious and proper young man than his companion.\n\n\"I do.  I’m Lady Lance.\"\n\nArianne had heard enough.  \"You may be a lance, but you are no lady.  Go below and stay there till we reach land.\"\n\nElsewise the crossing was uneventful.  At dusk they spied a galley in the distance, her oars rising and falling against the evening stars, but she was moving away from them, and soon dwindled and was gone.  Arianne played a game of cyvasse with Ser Daemon, and another one with Garibald Shells, and somehow managed to lose both.  Ser Garibald was kind enough to say that she played a gallant game, but Daemon mocked her.  \"You have other pieces beside the dragon, princess.  Try moving them sometime.\"\n\n\"I like the dragon.\"  She wanted to slap the smile off his face.  Or kiss it off, perhaps.  The man was as smug as he was comely.  Of all the knights in Dorne, why did my father chose this one to be my shield?  He knows our history.  \"It is just a game.  Tell me of Prince Viserys.\"\n\n\"The Beggar King?\"  Ser Daemon seemed surprised.  \n\n\"Everyone says that Prince Rhaegar was beautiful.  Was Viserys beautiful as well?\"\n\n\"I suppose.  He was Targaryen.  I never saw the man.\"\n\nThe secret pact that Prince Doran had made all those years called for Arianne to be wed to Prince Viserys, not Quentyn to Daenerys.  It had all come undone on the Dothraki sea, when he was murdered.  Crowned with a pot of molten gold.  \"He was killed by a Dothraki khal,\" said Arianne.  \"The dragon queen’s own husband.\"\n\n\"So I’ve heard.  What of it?\"      \n\n\"Just… why did Daenerys let it happen?  Viserys was her brother.  All that remained of her own blood.\"\n\n\"The Dothraki are a savage folk.  Who can know why they kill?  Perhaps Viserys wiped his arse with the wrong hand.\"\n\nPerhaps, thought Arianne, or perhaps Daenerys realized that once her brother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest of her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse.  \"She is the Mad King’s daughter,\" the princess said.  \"How do we do know — \"\n\n\"We cannot know,\" Ser Daemon said.  \"We can only hope.\"\n","slug":"ARIANNE","published":1,"updated":"2017-04-15T14:05:43.000Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck9met64r000isltpu895bknm","content":"<h2 id=\"ARIANNEE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\"><a href=\"#ARIANNEE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ARIANNEE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\"></a>ARIANNEE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER</h2><p>They struck out north by northwest, across drylands and parched plains and pale sands toward Ghost Hill, the stronghold of House Toland, where the ship that would take them across the Sea of Dorne awaited them.  “Send a raven whenever you have news,” Prince Doran told her, “but report only what you know to be true.  We are lost in fog here, besieged by rumors, falsehoods, and traveler’s tales.  I dare not act until I know for a certainty what is happening.”</p>\n<p>War is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be spared.  “Doom and death are coming,” Ellaria Sand had warned them, before she took her own leave from Prince Doran.  “It is time for my little snakes to scatter, the better to survive the carnage.”  Ellaria was returning to her father’s seat at Hellholt.  With her went her daughter Loreza, who had just turned seven.  Dorea remained at the Water Gardens, one child amongst a hundred.Obella was to be dispatched to Sunspear, to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of the castellan, Manfrey Martell.<br><a id=\"more\"></a><br>And Elia Sand, oldest of the four girls that Prince Oberyn had fathered on Ellaria, would cross the Sea of Dorne with Arianne.  “As a lady, not a lance,” her mother said firmly, but like all the Sand Snakes, Elia had her own mind.</p>\n<p>They crossed the sands in two long days and the better part of two nights, stopping thrice to change their horses.  It was a lonely time for Arianne, surrounded by so many strangers.  Elia was her cousin, but half a child, and Daemon Sand… things had never been the same between her and the Bastard of Godsgrace after her father refused his offer for her hand.  He was a boy then, and bastard born, no fit consort for a princess of Dorne, he should have known better.  And it was my father’s will, not mine.  The rest of her companions she hardly knew at all.    </p>\n<p>Arianne missed her friends.  Drey and Garin and her sweet Spotted Slyva had been a part of her since she was little, trusted confidants who had shared her dreams and secrets, cheered her when she was sad, helped her face her fears.  One of them had betrayed her, but she missed them all the same.  It was my own fault.  Arianne had made them part of her plot to steal off with Myrcella Baratheon and crown her queen, an act of rebellion meant to force her father’s hand, but someone’s loose tongue had undone her.  The clumsy conspiracy had accomplished nothing, except to cost poor Myrcella part of her face, and Ser Arys Oakheart his life.</p>\n<p>Arianne missed Ser Arys too, more than she ever would have thought.  He loved me madly, she told herself, yet I was never more than fond of him.  I made use of him in mybed and in my plot, took his love and took his honor, gave him nothing but my body.  In the end he could not live with what we’d done.  Why else would her white knight have charged right into Areo Hotah’s longaxe, to die the way he did?  I was a foolish willful girl, playing at the game of thrones like a drunkard rolling dice.  </p>\n<p>The cost of her folly had been dear.  Drey had been sent across the world to Norvos, Garin exiled to Tyrosh for two years, her sweet silly smiling Slyva married off to Eldon Estermont, a man old enough to be her grandsire.  Ser Arys had paid with his life’s blood, Myrcella with an ear.  </p>\n<p>Only Ser Gerold Dayne had escaped unscathed.  Darkstar.  If Myrcella’s horse had not shied at the last instant, his longsword would have opened her from chest to waist instead just taking off her ear.  Dayne was her most grievous sin, the one that Arianne most regretted.  With one stroke of his sword, he had changed her botched plot into something foul and bloody.  If the gods were good, by now Obara Sand had treed him in his mountain fastness and put an end to him.</p>\n<p>She said as much to Daemon Sand that first night, as they made camp.  “Be careful what you pray for, princess,” he replied.  “Darkstar could put an end to Lady Obara just as easily.”</p>\n<p>“She has Areo Hotah with her.”  Prince Doran’s captain of guards had dispatched Ser Arys Oakheart with a single blow, though the Kingsguard were supposed to be the finest knights in all the realm.  “No man can stand against Hotah.”</p>\n<p>“Is that what Darkstar is?  A man?”  Ser Daemon grimaced.  “A man would not have done what he did to Princess Myrcella.  Ser Gerold is more a viper than your uncle ever was.  Prince Oberyn could see that he was poison, he said so more than once.  It’s just a pity that he never got around to killing him.”</p>\n<p>Poison, thought Arianne.  Yes.  Pretty poison, though.  That was how he’d fooled her.  Gerold Dayne was hard and cruel, but so fair to look upon that the princess had not believed half the tales she’d heard of him.  Pretty boys had ever been her weakness, particularly the ones who were dark and dangerous as well.  That was before, when I was just a girl, she told herself.  I am a woman now, my father’s daughter.  I have learned that lesson.</p>\n<p>Come break of day, they were off again.  Elia Sand led the way, her black braid flying behind her as she raced across the dry, cracked plains and up into the hills.  The girl was mad for horses, which might be why she often smelled like one, to the despair of her mother.  Sometimes Arianne felt sorry for Ellaria.  Four girls, and every one of them her father’s daughter.  </p>\n<p>The rest of the party kept a more sedate pace.  The princess found herself riding beside Ser Daemon, remembering other rides when they were younger, rides that often ended in embraces.  When she found herself stealing glances at him, tall and gallant in the saddle, Arianne reminded herself that she was heir to Dorne, and him no more than her shield.  “Tell me what you know of this Jon Connington,” she commanded.</p>\n<p>“He’s dead,” said Daemon Sand.  “He died in the Disputed Lands.  Of drink, I’ve heard it said.”      </p>\n<p>“So a dead drunk leads this army?”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps this Jon Connington is a son of that one.  Or just some clever sellsword who has taken on a dead man’s name.”</p>\n<p>“Or he never died at all.”  Could Connington have been pretending to be dead for all these years?  That would require patience worthy of her father.  The thought made Arianne uneasy.  Treating with a man that subtle could be perilous.  “What was he like before he… before he died?”</p>\n<p>“I was a boy at Godsgrace when he was sent into exile.  I never knew the man.”</p>\n<p>“Then tell me what you’ve heard of him from others.”</p>\n<p>“As my princess commands.  Connington was Lord of Griffin’s Roost when Griffin’s Roost was still a lordship worth the having.  Prince Rhaegar’s squire, or one of them.  Later Prince Rhaegar’s friend and companion.  The Mad King named him Hand during Robert’s Rebellion, but he was defeated at Stoney Sept in the Battle of the Bells, and Robert slipped away.  King Aerys was wroth, and sent Connington into exile.  There he died.”</p>\n<p>“Or not.”  Prince Doran had told her all of that.  There must be more.  “Those are just the things he did.  I know all that.  What sort of man was he?  Honest and honorable, venal and grasping, proud?”</p>\n<p>“Proud, for a certainty.  Even arrogant.  A faithful friend to Rhaegar, but prickly with others.  Robert was his liege, but I’ve heard it said that Connington chafed at serving such a lord.  Even then, Robert was known to be fond of wine and whores.”</p>\n<p>“No whores for Lord Jon, then?”</p>\n<p>“I could not say.  Some men keep their whoring secret.”</p>\n<p>“Did he have a wife?  A paramour?”</p>\n<p>Ser Daemon shrugged.  “Not that I have ever heard.”</p>\n<p>That was troubling too.  Ser Arys Oakheart had broken his vows for her, but it did not sound as if Jon Connington could be similarly swayed.  Can I match such a man with words alone?</p>\n<p>The princess lapsed into silence, all the while pondering what she would find at journey’s end.  That night when they made camp, she crept into the tent she shared with Jayne Ladybright and Elia Sand and slipped the bit of parchment out of her sleeve to read the words again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>To Prince Doran of House Martell,</em><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote-center\"><p>You will remember me, I pray.I knew your sister well,and was a leal servant of your good-brother.I grieve for them as you do.I did not die, no more than did your sister’s son.To save his life we kept him hidden,but the time for hiding is done.  A dragon has returned to Westeros to claim his birthright and seek vengeance for his father, and for the princess Elia, his mother.In her name I turn to Dorne.Do not forsake us.</p>\n</blockquote><br>Jon Connington<br>Lord of Griffin’s Roost<br>Hand of the True King</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Arianne read the letter thrice, then rolled it up and tucked it back into her sleeve.  A dragon has returned to Westeros, but not the dragon my father was expecting.  Nowhere in the words was there a mention of Daenerys Stormborn… nor of Prince Quentyn, her brother, who had been sent to seek the dragon queen.  The princess remembered how her father had pressed the onyx cyvasse piece into her palm, his voice hoarse and low as he confessed his plan.  A long and perilous voyage, with an uncertain welcome at its end, he had said.  He has gone to bring us back our heart’s desire.  Vengeance.  Justice.  Fire and blood.</p>\n<p>Fire and blood was what Jon Connington (if indeed it was him) was offering as well.  Or was it?  “He comes with sellswords, but no dragons,” Prince Doran had told her, the night the raven came.  “The Golden Company is the best and largest of the free companies, but ten thousand mercenaries cannot hope to win the Seven Kingdoms.  Elia’s son… I would weep for joy if some part of my sister had survived, but what proof do we have that this is Aegon?”  His voice broke when he said that.  “Where are the dragons?” he asked.  “Where is Daenerys?” and Arianne knew that he was really saying, “Where is my son?”</p>\n<p>In the Boneway and the Prince’s Pass, two Dornish hosts had massed, and there they sat, sharpening their spears, polishing their armor, dicing, drinking, quarreling, their numbers dwindling by the day, waiting, waiting, waiting for the Prince of Dorne to loose them on the enemies of House Martell.  Waiting for the dragons.  For fire and blood.  For me.  One word from Arianne and those armies would march… so long as that word wasdragon.  If instead the word she sent was war, Lord Yronwood and Lord Fowler and their armies would remain in place.  The Prince of Dorne was nothing if not subtle; here warmeant wait.  </p>\n<p>At mid-morning on the third day Ghost Hill loomed up before them, its chalk-white walls shining against the deep blue of the Sea of Dorne.  From the square towers at the castle’s corners flew the banners of House Toland; a green dragon biting its own tail, upon a golden field.  The sun-and-spear of House Martell streamed atop the great central keep, gold and red and orange, defiant.</p>\n<p>Ravens had flown ahead to warn Lady Toland of their coming, so the castle gates were open, and Nymella’s eldest daughter rode forth with her steward to meet them near the bottom of the hill.  Tall and fierce, with a blaze of bright red hair tumbling about her shoulders, Valena Toland greeted Arianne with a shout of, “Come at last, have you?  How slow are those horses?”</p>\n<p>“Swift enough to outrun yours to the castle gates.”    </p>\n<p>“We will see about that.”  Valena wheeled her big red around and put her heels into him, and the race was on, through the dusty lanes of the village at the bottom of the hill, as chickens and villagers alike scrambled out of their path.  Arianne was three horse lengths behind by the time she got her mare up to a gallop, but had closed to one halfway up the slope.  The two of them were side-by-side as they thundered towards the gatehouse, but five yards from the gates Elia Sand came flying from the cloud of dust behind them to rush past both of them on her black filly.</p>\n<p>“Are you half horse, child?” Valena asked, laughing, in the yard.  “Princess, did you bring a stable girl?”</p>\n<p>“I’m Elia,” the girl announced.  “Lady Lance.”</p>\n<p>Whoever hung that name on her has much to answer for.  Like as not it had been Prince Oberyn, though, and the Red Viper had never answered to anyone but himself.</p>\n<p>“The girl jouster,” Valena said.  “Yes, I’ve heard of you.  Since you were the first to the yard, you’ve won the honor of watering and bridling the horses.”</p>\n<p>“And after that find the bath house,” said Princess Arianne.  Elia was chalk and dust from heels to hair.  </p>\n<p>That night Arianne and her knights supped with Lady Nymella and her daughters in the great hall of the castle.  Teora, the younger girl, had the same red hair as her sister, but elsewise could not have been more different.  Short, plump, and so shy she might have passed for a mute, she displayed more interest in the spiced beef and honeyed duck than in the comely young knights at the table, and seemed content to let her lady mother and her sister speak for House Toland.  </p>\n<p>“We have heard the same tales here that you have heard at Sunspear,” Lady Nymella told them as her serving man poured the wine.  “Sellswords landing on Cape Wrath, castles under siege or being taken, crops seized or burned.  Where these men come from and who they are, no one is certain.”</p>\n<p>“Pirates and adventurers, we heard at first,” said Valena.  “Then it was supposed to be the Golden Company.  Now it’s said to be Jon Connington, the Mad King’s Hand, come back from the grave to reclaim his birthright.  Whoever it is, Griffin’s Roost has fallen to them.  Rain House, Crow’s Nest, Mistwood, even Greenstone on its island.  All taken.”</p>\n<p>Arianne’s thoughts went at once to her sweet Spotted Slyva.  “Who would want Greenstone?  Was there a battle?”</p>\n<p>“Not as we have heard, but all the tales are garbled.”</p>\n<p>“Tarth has fallen too, some fisherfolk will tell you,” said Valena.  “These sellswords now hold most of Cape Wrath and half the Stepstones.  We hear talk of elephants in the rainwood.”</p>\n<p>“Elephants?”  Arianne did not know what to think of that.  “Are you certain?  Not dragons?”</p>\n<p>“Elephants,” Lady Nymella said firmly.</p>\n<p>“And krakens off the Broken Arm, pulling under crippled galleys,” said Valena.  “The blood draws them to the surface, our maester claims.  There are bodies in the water.  A few have washed up on our shores.  And that’s not half of it.  A new pirate king has set up on Torturer’s Deep.  The Lord of the Waters, he styles himself.  This one has real warships, three-deckers, monstrous large.  You were wise not to come by sea.  Since the Redwyne fleet passed through the Stepstones, those waters are crawling with strange sails, all the way north to the Straights of Tarth and Shipbreaker’s Bay.  Myrmen, Volantenes, Lyseni, even reavers from the Iron Islands.  Some have entered the Sea of Dorne to land men on the south shore of Cape Wrath.  We found a good fast ship for you, as your father commanded, but even so… be careful.”</p>\n<p>It is true, then.  Arianne wanted to ask after her brother, but her father had urged her to watch every word.  If these ships had not brought Quentyn home again with his dragon queen, best not to mention him.  Only her father and a few of his most trusted men knew about her brother’s mission to Slaver’s Bay.  Lady Toland and her daughters were not amongst them.  If it were Quentyn, he would have brought Daenerys back to Dorne, surely.  Why would he risk a landing on Cape Wrath, amongst the stormlords?  </p>\n<p>“Is Dorne at risk?” Lady Nymella asked.  “I confess, each time I see a strange sail my heart leaps to my throat.  What if these ships turn south?  The best part of the Toland strength is with Lord Yronwood in the Boneway.  Who will defend Ghost Hill if these strangers land upon our shores?  Should I call my men home?”</p>\n<p>“Your men are needed where they are, my lady,” Daemon Sand assured her.  Arianne was quick to nod.  Any other counsel could well lead to Lord Yronwood’s host unravelling like an old tapestry as each man rushed home to defend his own lands against supposed enemies who might or might not ever come.  “Once we know beyond a doubt whether these be friends or foes, my father will know what to do,” the princess said.</p>\n<p>It was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the creamcakes on her plate.  “It is dragons.”      </p>\n<p>“Dragons?”  said her mother.  “Teora, don’t be mad.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not.  They’re coming.”</p>\n<p>“How could you possibly know that?” her sister asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.</p>\n<p>“One of your little dreams?”</p>\n<p>Teora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling.  “They were dancing.  In my dream.  And everywhere the dragons danced the people died.”</p>\n<p>“Seven save us.”  Lady Nymella gave an exasperated sigh.</p>\n<p>“If you did not eat so many creamcakes you would not have such dreams.  Rich foods are not for girls your age, when your humors are so unbalanced.  Maester Toman says — “</p>\n<p>“I hate Maester Toman,” Teora said.  Then she bolted from the table, leaving her lady mother to make apologies for her.</p>\n<p>“Be gentle with her, my lady,” Arianne said.  “I remember when I was her age.  My father despaired of me, I’m sure.”  </p>\n<p>“I can attest to that.”  Ser Daemon took a sip of wine and said, “House Toland has a dragon on its banners.”  </p>\n<p>“A dragon eating its own tail, aye,” Valena said.  “From the days of Aegon’s Conquest.  He did not conquer here.  Elsewhere he burned his foes, him and his sisters, but here we melted away before them, leaving only stone and sand for them to burn.  And round and round the dragons went, snapping at their tails for want of any other food, till they were tied in knots.”</p>\n<p>“Our forebears played their part in that,” Lady Nymella said proudly.  “Bold deeds were done, and brave men died.  All of it was written down by the maesters who served us.  We have books, if my princess would like to know more.”</p>\n<p>“Some other time, perhaps,” said Arianne.</p>\n<p>As Ghost Hill slept that night, the princess donned a hooded cloak against the chill and and walked the castle battlements to clear her thoughts.  Daemon Sand found her leaning on a parapet and gazing out to sea, where the moon was dancing on the water.  “Princess,” he said.  “You ought to be abed.”</p>\n<p>“I could say the same of you.”  Arianne turned to gaze upon his face.  A good face, she decided.  The boy I knew has become a handsome man.  His eyes were as blue as a desert sky, his hair the light brown of the sands they had just crossed.  A close-cropped beard followed the thin of a strong jaw, but could not quite hide the dimples when he smiled.  I always loved his smile.</p>\n<p>The Bastard of Godsgrace was one of Dorne’s finest swords as well, as might be expected from one who had been Prince Oberyn’s squire and had received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself.  Some said that he had been her uncle’s lover too, though seldom to his face.  Arianne did not know the truth of that.  He had been her lover, though.  At fourteen she had given him her maidenhead.  Daemon had not been much older, so their couplings had been as clumsy as they were ardent.  Still, it had been sweet.  </p>\n<p>Arianne gave him her most seductive smile.  “We might share a bed together.”</p>\n<p>Ser Daemon’s face was stone.  “Have you forgotten, princess?  I am bastard born.”  He took her hand in his.  “If I am unworthy of this hand, how can I be worthy of your cunt?”</p>\n<p>She snatched her hand away.  “You deserve a slap for that.”  </p>\n<p>“My face is yours.  Do what you will.”</p>\n<p>“What I will you will not, it seems.  So be it.  Talk with me instead.  Could this truly be Prince Aegon?”</p>\n<p>“Gregor Clegane ripped Aegon out of Elia’s arms and smashed his head against a wall,” Ser Daemon said.  “If Lord Connington’s prince has a crushed skull, I will believe that Aegon Targaryen has returned from the grave.  Elsewise, no.  This is some feigned boy, no more.  A sellsword’s ploy to win support.”</p>\n<p>My father fears the same.  “If not, though… if this truly is Jon Connington, if the boy is Rhaegar’s son… “</p>\n<p>“Are you hoping that he is, or that he’s not?”</p>\n<p>“I… it would give great joy to my father if Elia’s son were still alive.  He loved his sister well.”</p>\n<p>“It was you I asked about, not your father.”</p>\n<p>So it was.  “I was seven when Elia died.  They say I held her daughter Rhaenys once, when I was too young to remember.  Aegon will be a stranger to me, whether true or false.”  The princess paused.  “We looked for Rhaegar’s sister, not his son.”  Her father had confided in Ser Daemon when he chose him as his daughter’s shield; with him at least she could speak freely.  “I would sooner it were Quentyn who’d returned.”</p>\n<p>“Or so you say,” said Daemon Sand.  “Good night, princess.”  He bowed to her, and left her standing there.</p>\n<p>What did he mean by that?  Arianne watched him walk away.  What sort of sister would I be, if I did not want my brother back?  It was true, she had resented Quentyn for all those years that she had thought their father meant to name him as his heir in place of her, but that had turned out to be just a misunderstanding.  She was the heir to Dorne, she had her father’s word on that.  Quentyn would have his dragon queen, Daenerys.</p>\n<p>In Sunspear hung a portrait of the Princess Daenerys who had come to Dorne to marry one of Arianne’s forebears.  In her younger days Arianne had spent hours gazing at it, back when she was just a pudgy flat-chested girl on the cusp of maidenhood who prayed every night for the gods to make her pretty.  A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace.  Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort.King Quentyn.  Why did that sound so silly?  </p>\n<p>Almost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.  Her brother was an earnest boy,well-behaved and dutiful, but dull.  And plain, so plain.  The gods had given Arianne the beauty she had prayed for, but Quentyn must have prayed for something else.  His head was overlarge and sort of square, his hair the color of dried mud.  His shoulders slumped as well, and he was too thick about the middle.  He looks too much like Father.</p>\n<p>“I love my brother,” said Arianne, though only the moon could hear her.  Though if truth be told, she scarcely knew him.  Quentyn had been fostered by Lord Anders of House Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, the son of Lord Ormond Yronwood and grandson of Lord Edgar.  In his youth her uncle Oberyn had fought a duel with Edgar, had given him a wound that mortified and killed him.  Afterward men called him ‘the Red Viper,’ and spoke of poison on his blade.  The Yronwoods were an ancient house, proud and powerful.  Before the coming of the Rhoynar they had been kings over half of Dorne, with domains that dwarfed those of House Martell.  Blood feud and rebellion would surely have followed Lord Edgar’s death, had not her father acted at once.  The Red Viper went to Oldtown, thence across to the narrow sea to Lys, though none dared call it exile.  And in due time, Quentyn was given to Lord Anders to foster as a sign of trust.  That helped to heal the breach between Sunspear and the Yronwoods, but it had opened new ones between Quentyn and the Sand Snakes… and Arianne had always been closer to her cousins than to her distant brother.</p>\n<p>“We are still the same blood, though,” she whispered.  “Of course I want my brother home.  I do.”  The wind off the sea was raising gooseprickles all up and down her arms.  Arianne pulled her cloak about herself, and went off to seek her bed.</p>\n<p>Their ship was called the Peregrine.  They sailed upon the morning tide.  The gods were good to them, the sea calm.  Even with good winds, the crossing took a day and a night.  Jayne Ladybright grew greensick and spent most of the voyage spewing, which Elia Sand seemed to find hilarious.  “Someone needs to spank that child,” Joss Hood was heard to say… but Elia was amongst those who heard him say it.</p>\n<p>“I am almost a woman grown, ser,” she responded haughtily.  “I’ll let you spank me, though…  but first you’ll need to tilt with me, and knock me off my horse.”</p>\n<p>“We are on a ship, and without horses,” Joss replied.</p>\n<p>“And ladies do not joust,” insisted Ser Garibald Shells, a far more serious and proper young man than his companion.</p>\n<p>“I do.  I’m Lady Lance.”</p>\n<p>Arianne had heard enough.  “You may be a lance, but you are no lady.  Go below and stay there till we reach land.”</p>\n<p>Elsewise the crossing was uneventful.  At dusk they spied a galley in the distance, her oars rising and falling against the evening stars, but she was moving away from them, and soon dwindled and was gone.  Arianne played a game of cyvasse with Ser Daemon, and another one with Garibald Shells, and somehow managed to lose both.  Ser Garibald was kind enough to say that she played a gallant game, but Daemon mocked her.  “You have other pieces beside the dragon, princess.  Try moving them sometime.”</p>\n<p>“I like the dragon.”  She wanted to slap the smile off his face.  Or kiss it off, perhaps.  The man was as smug as he was comely.  Of all the knights in Dorne, why did my father chose this one to be my shield?  He knows our history.  “It is just a game.  Tell me of Prince Viserys.”</p>\n<p>“The Beggar King?”  Ser Daemon seemed surprised.  </p>\n<p>“Everyone says that Prince Rhaegar was beautiful.  Was Viserys beautiful as well?”</p>\n<p>“I suppose.  He was Targaryen.  I never saw the man.”</p>\n<p>The secret pact that Prince Doran had made all those years called for Arianne to be wed to Prince Viserys, not Quentyn to Daenerys.  It had all come undone on the Dothraki sea, when he was murdered.  Crowned with a pot of molten gold.  “He was killed by a Dothraki khal,” said Arianne.  “The dragon queen’s own husband.”</p>\n<p>“So I’ve heard.  What of it?”      </p>\n<p>“Just… why did Daenerys let it happen?  Viserys was her brother.  All that remained of her own blood.”</p>\n<p>“The Dothraki are a savage folk.  Who can know why they kill?  Perhaps Viserys wiped his arse with the wrong hand.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps, thought Arianne, or perhaps Daenerys realized that once her brother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest of her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse.  “She is the Mad King’s daughter,” the princess said.  “How do we do know — “</p>\n<p>“We cannot know,” Ser Daemon said.  “We can only hope.”</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"<h2 id=\"ARIANNEE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\"><a href=\"#ARIANNEE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ARIANNEE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\"></a>ARIANNEE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER</h2><p>They struck out north by northwest, across drylands and parched plains and pale sands toward Ghost Hill, the stronghold of House Toland, where the ship that would take them across the Sea of Dorne awaited them.  “Send a raven whenever you have news,” Prince Doran told her, “but report only what you know to be true.  We are lost in fog here, besieged by rumors, falsehoods, and traveler’s tales.  I dare not act until I know for a certainty what is happening.”</p>\n<p>War is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be spared.  “Doom and death are coming,” Ellaria Sand had warned them, before she took her own leave from Prince Doran.  “It is time for my little snakes to scatter, the better to survive the carnage.”  Ellaria was returning to her father’s seat at Hellholt.  With her went her daughter Loreza, who had just turned seven.  Dorea remained at the Water Gardens, one child amongst a hundred.Obella was to be dispatched to Sunspear, to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of the castellan, Manfrey Martell.<br>","more":"<br>And Elia Sand, oldest of the four girls that Prince Oberyn had fathered on Ellaria, would cross the Sea of Dorne with Arianne.  “As a lady, not a lance,” her mother said firmly, but like all the Sand Snakes, Elia had her own mind.</p>\n<p>They crossed the sands in two long days and the better part of two nights, stopping thrice to change their horses.  It was a lonely time for Arianne, surrounded by so many strangers.  Elia was her cousin, but half a child, and Daemon Sand… things had never been the same between her and the Bastard of Godsgrace after her father refused his offer for her hand.  He was a boy then, and bastard born, no fit consort for a princess of Dorne, he should have known better.  And it was my father’s will, not mine.  The rest of her companions she hardly knew at all.    </p>\n<p>Arianne missed her friends.  Drey and Garin and her sweet Spotted Slyva had been a part of her since she was little, trusted confidants who had shared her dreams and secrets, cheered her when she was sad, helped her face her fears.  One of them had betrayed her, but she missed them all the same.  It was my own fault.  Arianne had made them part of her plot to steal off with Myrcella Baratheon and crown her queen, an act of rebellion meant to force her father’s hand, but someone’s loose tongue had undone her.  The clumsy conspiracy had accomplished nothing, except to cost poor Myrcella part of her face, and Ser Arys Oakheart his life.</p>\n<p>Arianne missed Ser Arys too, more than she ever would have thought.  He loved me madly, she told herself, yet I was never more than fond of him.  I made use of him in mybed and in my plot, took his love and took his honor, gave him nothing but my body.  In the end he could not live with what we’d done.  Why else would her white knight have charged right into Areo Hotah’s longaxe, to die the way he did?  I was a foolish willful girl, playing at the game of thrones like a drunkard rolling dice.  </p>\n<p>The cost of her folly had been dear.  Drey had been sent across the world to Norvos, Garin exiled to Tyrosh for two years, her sweet silly smiling Slyva married off to Eldon Estermont, a man old enough to be her grandsire.  Ser Arys had paid with his life’s blood, Myrcella with an ear.  </p>\n<p>Only Ser Gerold Dayne had escaped unscathed.  Darkstar.  If Myrcella’s horse had not shied at the last instant, his longsword would have opened her from chest to waist instead just taking off her ear.  Dayne was her most grievous sin, the one that Arianne most regretted.  With one stroke of his sword, he had changed her botched plot into something foul and bloody.  If the gods were good, by now Obara Sand had treed him in his mountain fastness and put an end to him.</p>\n<p>She said as much to Daemon Sand that first night, as they made camp.  “Be careful what you pray for, princess,” he replied.  “Darkstar could put an end to Lady Obara just as easily.”</p>\n<p>“She has Areo Hotah with her.”  Prince Doran’s captain of guards had dispatched Ser Arys Oakheart with a single blow, though the Kingsguard were supposed to be the finest knights in all the realm.  “No man can stand against Hotah.”</p>\n<p>“Is that what Darkstar is?  A man?”  Ser Daemon grimaced.  “A man would not have done what he did to Princess Myrcella.  Ser Gerold is more a viper than your uncle ever was.  Prince Oberyn could see that he was poison, he said so more than once.  It’s just a pity that he never got around to killing him.”</p>\n<p>Poison, thought Arianne.  Yes.  Pretty poison, though.  That was how he’d fooled her.  Gerold Dayne was hard and cruel, but so fair to look upon that the princess had not believed half the tales she’d heard of him.  Pretty boys had ever been her weakness, particularly the ones who were dark and dangerous as well.  That was before, when I was just a girl, she told herself.  I am a woman now, my father’s daughter.  I have learned that lesson.</p>\n<p>Come break of day, they were off again.  Elia Sand led the way, her black braid flying behind her as she raced across the dry, cracked plains and up into the hills.  The girl was mad for horses, which might be why she often smelled like one, to the despair of her mother.  Sometimes Arianne felt sorry for Ellaria.  Four girls, and every one of them her father’s daughter.  </p>\n<p>The rest of the party kept a more sedate pace.  The princess found herself riding beside Ser Daemon, remembering other rides when they were younger, rides that often ended in embraces.  When she found herself stealing glances at him, tall and gallant in the saddle, Arianne reminded herself that she was heir to Dorne, and him no more than her shield.  “Tell me what you know of this Jon Connington,” she commanded.</p>\n<p>“He’s dead,” said Daemon Sand.  “He died in the Disputed Lands.  Of drink, I’ve heard it said.”      </p>\n<p>“So a dead drunk leads this army?”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps this Jon Connington is a son of that one.  Or just some clever sellsword who has taken on a dead man’s name.”</p>\n<p>“Or he never died at all.”  Could Connington have been pretending to be dead for all these years?  That would require patience worthy of her father.  The thought made Arianne uneasy.  Treating with a man that subtle could be perilous.  “What was he like before he… before he died?”</p>\n<p>“I was a boy at Godsgrace when he was sent into exile.  I never knew the man.”</p>\n<p>“Then tell me what you’ve heard of him from others.”</p>\n<p>“As my princess commands.  Connington was Lord of Griffin’s Roost when Griffin’s Roost was still a lordship worth the having.  Prince Rhaegar’s squire, or one of them.  Later Prince Rhaegar’s friend and companion.  The Mad King named him Hand during Robert’s Rebellion, but he was defeated at Stoney Sept in the Battle of the Bells, and Robert slipped away.  King Aerys was wroth, and sent Connington into exile.  There he died.”</p>\n<p>“Or not.”  Prince Doran had told her all of that.  There must be more.  “Those are just the things he did.  I know all that.  What sort of man was he?  Honest and honorable, venal and grasping, proud?”</p>\n<p>“Proud, for a certainty.  Even arrogant.  A faithful friend to Rhaegar, but prickly with others.  Robert was his liege, but I’ve heard it said that Connington chafed at serving such a lord.  Even then, Robert was known to be fond of wine and whores.”</p>\n<p>“No whores for Lord Jon, then?”</p>\n<p>“I could not say.  Some men keep their whoring secret.”</p>\n<p>“Did he have a wife?  A paramour?”</p>\n<p>Ser Daemon shrugged.  “Not that I have ever heard.”</p>\n<p>That was troubling too.  Ser Arys Oakheart had broken his vows for her, but it did not sound as if Jon Connington could be similarly swayed.  Can I match such a man with words alone?</p>\n<p>The princess lapsed into silence, all the while pondering what she would find at journey’s end.  That night when they made camp, she crept into the tent she shared with Jayne Ladybright and Elia Sand and slipped the bit of parchment out of her sleeve to read the words again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>To Prince Doran of House Martell,</em><br><blockquote class=\"blockquote-center\"><p>You will remember me, I pray.I knew your sister well,and was a leal servant of your good-brother.I grieve for them as you do.I did not die, no more than did your sister’s son.To save his life we kept him hidden,but the time for hiding is done.

Nowhere in the words was there a mention of Daenerys Stormborn… nor of Prince Quentyn, her brother, who had been sent to seek the dragon queen.  The princess remembered how her father had pressed the onyx cyvasse piece into her palm, his voice hoarse and low as he confessed his plan.  A long and perilous voyage, with an uncertain welcome at its end, he had said.  He has gone to bring us back our heart’s desire.  Vengeance.  Justice.  Fire and blood.</p>\n<p>Fire and blood was what Jon Connington (if indeed it was him) was offering as well.  Or was it?  “He comes with sellswords, but no dragons,” Prince Doran had told her, the night the raven came.  “The Golden Company is the best and largest of the free companies, but ten thousand mercenaries cannot hope to win the Seven Kingdoms.  Elia’s son… I would weep for joy if some part of my sister had survived, but what proof do we have that this is Aegon?”  His voice broke when he said that.  “Where are the dragons?” he asked.  “Where is Daenerys?” and Arianne knew that he was really saying, “Where is my son?”</p>\n<p>In the Boneway and the Prince’s Pass, two Dornish hosts had massed, and there they sat, sharpening their spears, polishing their armor, dicing, drinking, quarreling, their numbers dwindling by the day, waiting, waiting, waiting for the Prince of Dorne to loose them on the enemies of House Martell.  Waiting for the dragons.  For fire and blood.  For me.  One word from Arianne and those armies would march… so long as that word wasdragon.  If instead the word she sent was war, Lord Yronwood and Lord Fowler and their armies would remain in place.  The Prince of Dorne was nothing if not subtle; here warmeant wait.  </p>\n<p>At mid-morning on the third day Ghost Hill loomed up before them, its chalk-white walls shining against the deep blue of the Sea of Dorne.  From the square towers at the castle’s corners flew the banners of House Toland; a green dragon biting its own tail, upon a golden field.  The sun-and-spear of House Martell streamed atop the great central keep, gold and red and orange, defiant.</p>\n<p>Ravens had flown ahead to warn Lady Toland of their coming, so the castle gates were open, and Nymella’s eldest daughter rode forth with her steward to meet them near the bottom of the hill.  Tall and fierce, with a blaze of bright red hair tumbling about her shoulders, Valena Toland greeted Arianne with a shout of, “Come at last, have you?  How slow are those horses?”</p>\n<p>“Swift enough to outrun yours to the castle gates.”    </p>\n<p>“We will see about that.”  Valena wheeled her big red around and put her heels into him, and the race was on, through the dusty lanes of the village at the bottom of the hill, as chickens and villagers alike scrambled out of their path.  Arianne was three horse lengths behind by the time she got her mare up to a gallop, but had closed to one halfway up the slope.  The two of them were side-by-side as they thundered towards the gatehouse, but five yards from the gates Elia Sand came flying from the cloud of dust behind them to rush past both of them on her black filly.</p>\n<p>“Are you half horse, child?” Valena asked, laughing, in the yard.  “Princess, did you bring a stable girl?”</p>\n<p>“I’m Elia,” the girl announced.  “Lady Lance.”</p>\n<p>Whoever hung that name on her has much to answer for.  Like as not it had been Prince Oberyn, though, and the Red Viper had never answered to anyone but himself.</p>\n<p>“The girl jouster,” Valena said.  “Yes, I’ve heard of you.  Since you were the first to the yard, you’ve won the honor of watering and bridling the horses.”</p>\n<p>“And after that find the bath house,” said Princess Arianne.  Elia was chalk and dust from heels to hair.  </p>\n<p>That night Arianne and her knights supped with Lady Nymella and her daughters in the great hall of the castle.  Teora, the younger girl, had the same red hair as her sister, but elsewise could not have been more different.  Short, plump, and so shy she might have passed for a mute, she displayed more interest in the spiced beef and honeyed duck than in the comely young knights at the table, and seemed content to let her lady mother and her sister speak for House Toland.  </p>\n<p>“We have heard the same tales here that you have heard at Sunspear,” Lady Nymella told them as her serving man poured the wine.  “Sellswords landing on Cape Wrath, castles under siege or being taken, crops seized or burned.  Where these men come from and who they are, no one is certain.”</p>\n<p>“Pirates and adventurers, we heard at first,” said Valena.  “Then it was supposed to be the Golden Company.  Now it’s said to be Jon Connington, the Mad King’s Hand, come back from the grave to reclaim his birthright.  Whoever it is, Griffin’s Roost has fallen to them.  Rain House, Crow’s Nest, Mistwood, even Greenstone on its island.  All taken.”</p>\n<p>Arianne’s thoughts went at once to her sweet Spotted Slyva.  “Who would want Greenstone?  Was there a battle?”</p>\n<p>“Not as we have heard, but all the tales are garbled.”</p>\n<p>“Tarth has fallen too, some fisherfolk will tell you,” said Valena.  “These sellswords now hold most of Cape Wrath and half the Stepstones.  We hear talk of elephants in the rainwood.”</p>\n<p>“Elephants?”  Arianne did not know what to think of that.  “Are you certain?  Not dragons?”</p>\n<p>“Elephants,” Lady Nymella said firmly.</p>\n<p>“And krakens off the Broken Arm, pulling under crippled galleys,” said Valena.  “The blood draws them to the surface, our maester claims.  There are bodies in the water.  A few have washed up on our shores.  And that’s not half of it.  A new pirate king has set up on Torturer’s Deep.  The Lord of the Waters, he styles himself.  This one has real warships, three-deckers, monstrous large.  You were wise not to come by sea.  Since the Redwyne fleet passed through the Stepstones, those waters are crawling with strange sails, all the way north to the Straights of Tarth and Shipbreaker’s Bay.  Myrmen, Volantenes, Lyseni, even reavers from the Iron Islands.  Some have entered the Sea of Dorne to land men on the south shore of Cape Wrath.  We found a good fast ship for you, as your father commanded, but even so… be careful.”</p>\n<p>It is true, then.  Arianne wanted to ask after her brother, but her father had urged her to watch every word.  If these ships had not brought Quentyn home again with his dragon queen, best not to mention him.  Only her father and a few of his most trusted men knew about her brother’s mission to Slaver’s Bay.  Lady Toland and her daughters were not amongst them.  If it were Quentyn, he would have brought Daenerys back to Dorne, surely.  Why would he risk a landing on Cape Wrath, amongst the stormlords?  </p>\n<p>“Is Dorne at risk?” Lady Nymella asked.  “I confess, each time I see a strange sail my heart leaps to my throat.  What if these ships turn south?  The best part of the Toland strength is with Lord Yronwood in the Boneway.  Who will defend Ghost Hill if these strangers land upon our shores?  Should I call my men home?”</p>\n<p>“Your men are needed where they are, my lady,” Daemon Sand assured her.  Arianne was quick to nod.  Any other counsel could well lead to Lord Yronwood’s host unravelling like an old tapestry as each man rushed home to defend his own lands against supposed enemies who might or might not ever come.  “Once we know beyond a doubt whether these be friends or foes, my father will know what to do,” the princess said.</p>\n<p>It was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the creamcakes on her plate.  “It is dragons.”      </p>\n<p>“Dragons?”  said her mother.  “Teora, don’t be mad.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not.  They’re coming.”</p>\n<p>“How could you possibly know that?” her sister asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.</p>\n<p>“One of your little dreams?”</p>\n<p>Teora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling.  “They were dancing.  In my dream.  And everywhere the dragons danced the people died.”</p>\n<p>“Seven save us.”  Lady Nymella gave an exasperated sigh.</p>\n<p>“If you did not eat so many creamcakes you would not have such dreams.  Rich foods are not for girls your age, when your humors are so unbalanced.  Maester Toman says — “</p>\n<p>“I hate Maester Toman,” Teora said.  Then she bolted from the table, leaving her lady mother to make apologies for her.</p>\n<p>“Be gentle with her, my lady,” Arianne said.  “I remember when I was her age.  My father despaired of me, I’m sure.”  </p>\n<p>“I can attest to that.”  Ser Daemon took a sip of wine and said, “House Toland has a dragon on its banners.”  </p>\n<p>“A dragon eating its own tail, aye,” Valena said.  “From the days of Aegon’s Conquest.  He did not conquer here.  Elsewhere he burned his foes, him and his sisters, but here we melted away before them, leaving only stone and sand for them to burn.  And round and round the dragons went, snapping at their tails for want of any other food, till they were tied in knots.”</p>\n<p>“Our forebears played their part in that,” Lady Nymella said proudly.  “Bold deeds were done, and brave men died.  All of it was written down by the maesters who served us.  We have books, if my princess would like to know more.”</p>\n<p>“Some other time, perhaps,” said Arianne.</p>\n<p>As Ghost Hill slept that night, the princess donned a hooded cloak against the chill and and walked the castle battlements to clear her thoughts.  Daemon Sand found her leaning on a parapet and gazing out to sea, where the moon was dancing on the water.  “Princess,” he said.  “You ought to be abed.”</p>\n<p>“I could say the same of you.”  Arianne turned to gaze upon his face.  A good face, she decided.  The boy I knew has become a handsome man.  His eyes were as blue as a desert sky, his hair the light brown of the sands they had just crossed.  A close-cropped beard followed the thin of a strong jaw, but could not quite hide the dimples when he smiled.  I always loved his smile.</p>\n<p>The Bastard of Godsgrace was one of Dorne’s finest swords as well, as might be expected from one who had been Prince Oberyn’s squire and had received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself.  Some said that he had been her uncle’s lover too, though seldom to his face.  Arianne did not know the truth of that.  He had been her lover, though.  At fourteen she had given him her maidenhead.  Daemon had not been much older, so their couplings had been as clumsy as they were ardent.  Still, it had been sweet.  </p>\n<p>Arianne gave him her most seductive smile.  “We might share a bed together.”</p>\n<p>Ser Daemon’s face was stone.  “Have you forgotten, princess?  I am bastard born.”  He took her hand in his.  “If I am unworthy of this hand, how can I be worthy of your cunt?”</p>\n<p>She snatched her hand away.  “You deserve a slap for that.”  </p>\n<p>“My face is yours.  Do what you will.”</p>\n<p>“What I will you will not, it seems.  So be it.  Talk with me instead.  Could this truly be Prince Aegon?”</p>\n<p>“Gregor Clegane ripped Aegon out of Elia’s arms and smashed his head against a wall,” Ser Daemon said.  “If Lord Connington’s prince has a crushed skull, I will believe that Aegon Targaryen has returned from the grave.  Elsewise, no.  This is some feigned boy, no more.  A sellsword’s ploy to win support.”</p>\n<p>My father fears the same.  “If not, though… if this truly is Jon Connington, if the boy is Rhaegar’s son… “</p>\n<p>“Are you hoping that he is, or that he’s not?”</p>\n<p>“I… it would give great joy to my father if Elia’s son were still alive.  He loved his sister well.”</p>\n<p>“It was you I asked about, not your father.”</p>\n<p>So it was.  “I was seven when Elia died.  They say I held her daughter Rhaenys once, when I was too young to remember.  Aegon will be a stranger to me, whether true or false.”  The princess paused.  “We looked for Rhaegar’s sister, not his son.”  Her father had confided in Ser Daemon when he chose him as his daughter’s shield; with him at least she could speak freely.  “I would sooner it were Quentyn who’d returned.”</p>\n<p>“Or so you say,” said Daemon Sand.  “Good night, princess.”  He bowed to her, and left her standing there.</p>\n<p>What did he mean by that?  Arianne watched him walk away.  What sort of sister would I be, if I did not want my brother back?  It was true, she had resented Quentyn for all those years that she had thought their father meant to name him as his heir in place of her, but that had turned out to be just a misunderstanding.  She was the heir to Dorne, she had her father’s word on that.  Quentyn would have his dragon queen, Daenerys.</p>\n<p>In Sunspear hung a portrait of the Princess Daenerys who had come to Dorne to marry one of Arianne’s forebears.  In her younger days Arianne had spent hours gazing at it, back when she was just a pudgy flat-chested girl on the cusp of maidenhood who prayed every night for the gods to make her pretty.  A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace.  Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort.King Quentyn.  Why did that sound so silly?  </p>\n<p>Almost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.  Her brother was an earnest boy,well-behaved and dutiful, but dull.  And plain, so plain.  The gods had given Arianne the beauty she had prayed for, but Quentyn must have prayed for something else.  His head was overlarge and sort of square, his hair the color of dried mud.  His shoulders slumped as well, and he was too thick about the middle.  He looks too much like Father.</p>\n<p>“I love my brother,” said Arianne, though only the moon could hear her.  Though if truth be told, she scarcely knew him.  Quentyn had been fostered by Lord Anders of House Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, the son of Lord Ormond Yronwood and grandson of Lord Edgar.  In his youth her uncle Oberyn had fought a duel with Edgar, had given him a wound that mortified and killed him.  Afterward men called him ‘the Red Viper,’ and spoke of poison on his blade.  The Yronwoods were an ancient house, proud and powerful.  Before the coming of the Rhoynar they had been kings over half of Dorne, with domains that dwarfed those of House Martell.  Blood feud and rebellion would surely have followed Lord Edgar’s death, had not her father acted at once.  The Red Viper went to Oldtown, thence across to the narrow sea to Lys, though none dared call it exile.  And in due time, Quentyn was given to Lord Anders to foster as a sign of trust.  That helped to heal the breach between Sunspear and the Yronwoods, but it had opened new ones between Quentyn and the Sand Snakes… and Arianne had always been closer to her cousins than to her distant brother.</p>\n<p>“We are still the same blood, though,” she whispered.  “Of course I want my brother home.  I do.”  The wind off the sea was raising gooseprickles all up and down her arms.  Arianne pulled her cloak about herself, and went off to seek her bed.</p>\n<p>Their ship was called the Peregrine.  They sailed upon the morning tide.  The gods were good to them, the sea calm.  Even with good winds, the crossing took a day and a night.  Jayne Ladybright grew greensick and spent most of the voyage spewing, which Elia Sand seemed to find hilarious.  “Someone needs to spank that child,” Joss Hood was heard to say… but Elia was amongst those who heard him say it.</p>\n<p>“I am almost a woman grown, ser,” she responded haughtily.  “I’ll let you spank me, though…  but first you’ll need to tilt with me, and knock me off my horse.”</p>\n<p>“We are on a ship, and without horses,” Joss replied.</p>\n<p>“And ladies do not joust,” insisted Ser Garibald Shells, a far more serious and proper young man than his companion.</p>\n<p>“I do.  I’m Lady Lance.”</p>\n<p>Arianne had heard enough.  “You may be a lance, but you are no lady.  Go below and stay there till we reach land.”</p>\n<p>Elsewise the crossing was uneventful.  At dusk they spied a galley in the distance, her oars rising and falling against the evening stars, but she was moving away from them, and soon dwindled and was gone.  Arianne played a game of cyvasse with Ser Daemon, and another one with Garibald Shells, and somehow managed to lose both.  Ser Garibald was kind enough to say that she played a gallant game, but Daemon mocked her.  “You have other pieces beside the dragon, princess.  Try moving them sometime.”</p>\n<p>“I like the dragon.”  She wanted to slap the smile off his face.  Or kiss it off, perhaps.  The man was as smug as he was comely.  Of all the knights in Dorne, why did my father chose this one to be my shield?  He knows our history.  “It is just a game.  Tell me of Prince Viserys.”</p>\n<p>“The Beggar King?”  Ser Daemon seemed surprised.  </p>\n<p>“Everyone says that Prince Rhaegar was beautiful.  Was Viserys beautiful as well?”</p>\n<p>“I suppose.  He was Targaryen.  I never saw the man.”</p>\n<p>The secret pact that Prince Doran had made all those years called for Arianne to be wed to Prince Viserys, not Quentyn to Daenerys.  It had all come undone on the Dothraki sea, when he was murdered.  Crowned with a pot of molten gold.  “He was killed by a Dothraki khal,” said Arianne.  “The dragon queen’s own husband.”</p>\n<p>“So I’ve heard.  What of it?”      </p>\n<p>“Just… why did Daenerys let it happen?  Viserys was her brother.  All that remained of her own blood.”</p>\n<p>“The Dothraki are a savage folk.  Who can know why they kill?  Perhaps Viserys wiped his arse with the wrong hand.”</p>\n<p>Perhaps, thought Arianne, or perhaps Daenerys realized that once her brother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest of her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse.  “She is the Mad King’s daughter,” the princess said.  “How do we do know — “</p>\n<p>“We cannot know,” Ser Daemon said.  “We can only hope.”</p>"},{"title":"ALAYNE","date":"2016-04-06T12:59:24.000Z","comments":0,"_content":"## ALAYNE\\--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\n\nShe was reading her little lord a tale of the Winged Knight when Mya Stone came knocking on the door of his bedchamber, clad in boots and riding leathers and smelling strongly of the stable. Mya had straw in her hair and a scowl on her face. That scowl comes of having Mychel Redfort near, Alayne knew.\n\n“Your lordship,” Mya informed Lord Robert, “Lady Waynwood’s banners have been seen an hour down the road. She will be here soon, with your cousin Harry. Will you want to greet them?”\n\nWhy did she have to mention Harry? Alayne thought. We will never get Sweetrobin out of bed now. The boy slapped a pillow. “Send them away. I never asked them here.”\n<!-- more -->\nMya looked nonplussed. No one in the Vale was better at handling a mule, but lordlings were another matter. “They were invited,” she said uncertainly, “for the tourney. I don’t… “\n\nAlayne closed her book.  “Thank you, Mya. Let me talk with Lord Robert, if you would.”\n\nRelief plain on her face, Mya fled without another word.\n\n“I hate that Harry,” Sweetrobin said when she was gone. “He calls me cousin, but he’s just waiting for me to die so he can take the Eyrie. He thinks I don’t know, but I do.”\n\n“Your lordship should not believe such nonsense,” Alayne said. “I’m sure Ser Harrold loves you well.” And if the gods are good, he will love me too. Her tummy gave a little flutter.\n\n“He doesn’t,” Lord Robert insisted. “He wants my father’s castle, that’s all, so he pretends.” The boy clutched the blanket to his pimply chest. “I don’t want you to marry him, Alayne. I am the Lord of the Eyrie, and I forbid it.” He sounded as if he were about to cry. “You should marry me instead. We could sleep in the same bed every night, and you could read me stories.”\n\nNo man can wed me so long as my dwarf husband still lives somewhere in this world. Queen Cersei had collected the head of a dozen dwarfs, Petyr claimed, but none were Tyrion’s. “Sweetrobin, you must not say such things. You are the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, and you must wed a highborn lady and father a son to sit in the High Hall of House Arryn after you are gone.”\n\nRobert wiped his nose. “But I want — “\n\nShe put a finger to his lips. “I know what you want, but it cannot be. I am no fit wife for you. I am bastard born.”\n\n“I don’t care. I love you best of anyone. “\n\nYou are such a little fool.  “Your lords bannermen will care. Some call my father upjumped and ambitious. If you were to take me to wife, they would say that he made you do it, that it was no will of yours. The Lords Declarant might take arms against him once again, and he and I should both be put to death.”\n\n“I wouldn’t let them hurt you!” Lord Robert said. “If they try I will make them all fly.” His hand began to tremble.\n\nAlayne stroked his fingers. “There, my Sweetrobin, be still now.” When the shaking passed, she said, “You must have a proper wife, a trueborn maid of noble birth.”\n\n“No. I want to marry you, Alayne.”\n\nOnce your lady mother intended that very thing, but I was trueborn then, and noble. “My lord is kind to say so.” Alayne smoothed his hair. Lady Lysa had never let the servants touch it, and after she had died Robert had suffered terrible shaking fits whenever anyone came near him with a blade, so it had been allowed to grow until it tumbled over his round shoulders and halfway down his flabby white chest. He does have pretty hair.  If the gods are good and he lives long enough to wed, his wife will admire his hair, surely.  That much she will love about him. “Any child of ours would be baseborn. Only a trueborn child of House Arryn can displace Ser Harrold as your heir. My father will find a proper wife for you, some highborn girl much prettier than me. You’ll hunt and hawk together, and she’ll give you her favor to wear in tournaments. Before long, you will have forgotten me entirely.”\n\n“I won’t!”\n\n“You will. You must.” Her voice was firm, but gentle.\n\n“The Lord of the Eyrie can do as he likes. Can’t I still love you, even if I have to marry her? Ser Harrold has a common woman. Benjicot says she’s carrying his bastard.”\n\nBenjicot should learn to keep his fool’s mouth shut. “Is that what you would have from me? A bastard?” She pulled her fingers from his grasp. “Would you dishonor me that way?”\n\nThe boy looked stricken. “No. I never meant — “\n\nAlayne stood. “If it please my lord, I must go and find my father. Someone needs to greet Lady Waynwood.” Before her little lord could find the words to protest, she gave him a quick curtsy and fled the bedchamber, sweeping down the hall and across a covered bridge to the Lord Protector’s apartments.\n\nWhen she had left Petyr Baelish that morning he had been breaking his fast with old Oswell who had arrived last night from Gulltown on a lathered horse. She hoped they might still be talking, but Petyr’s solar proved empty. Someone had left a window open and a stack of papers had blown onto the floor. The sun was slanting through the thick yellow windows, and dust motes danced in the light like tiny golden insects. Though snow had blanketed the heights of the Giant’s Lance above, below the mountain the autumn lingered and winter wheat was ripening in the fields.  Outside the window she could hear the laughter of the washerwomen at the well, the din of steel on steel from the ward where the knights were at their drills. Good sounds.\n\nAlayne loved it here. She felt alive again, for the first since her father… since Lord Eddard Stark had died.\n\nShe closed the window, gathered up the fallen papers, and stacked them on the table. One was a list of the competitors. Four-and-sixty knights had been invited to vie for places amongst Lord Robert Arryn’s  new Brotherhood of Winged Knights, and four­ and-sixty knights had come to tilt for the right to wear falcon’s wings upon their warhelms and guard their lord.\n\nThe competitors came from all over the Vale, from the mountain valleys and the coast, from Gulltown and the Bloody Gate, even the Three Sisters. Though a few were promised, only three were wed; the eight victors would be expected to spend the next three years at Lord Robert’s side, as his own personal guard (Alayne had suggested seven, like the Kingsguard, but Sweetrobin had insisted that he must have more knights than King Tommen), so older men with wives and children had not been invited.\n\nAnd they came, Alayne thought proudly. They all came.\n\nIt had fallen out just as Petyr said it would, the day the ravens flew. “They’re young, eager, hungry for adventure and renown. Lysa would not let them go to war. This is the next best thing. A chance to serve their lord and prove their prowess. They will come. Even Harry the Heir.” He had smoothed her hair and kissed her forehead. “What a clever daughter you are.”\n\nIt was clever. The tourney, the prizes, the winged knights, it had all been her own notion. Lord Robert’s mother had filled him full of fears, but he always took courage from the tales she read him of Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight of legend, founder of his line. Why not surround him with Winged Knights?  She had thought one night, after Sweetrobin had finally drifted off to sleep. His own Kingsguard, to keep him safe and make him brave. And no sooner did she tell Petyr her idea than he went out and made it happen. He will want to be there to greet Ser Harrold. Where could he have gone?\n\nAlayne swept down the tower stairs to enter the pillared gallery at the back of the Great Hall. Below her, serving men were setting up trestle tables for the evening feast, while their wives and daughters swept up the old rushes and scattered fresh ones. Lord Nestor was showing Lady Waxley his prize tapestries, with their scenes of hunt and chase. The same panels had once hung in the Red Keep of King’s Landing, when Robert sat the Iron Throne. Joffrey had them taken down and they had languished in some cellar until Petyr Baelish arranged for them to be brought to the Vale as a gift for Nestor Royce. Not only were the hangings beautiful, but the High Steward delighted in telling anyone who’d listen that they had once belonged to a king.\n\nPetyr was not in the Great Hall. Alayne crossed the gallery and descended the stair built into the thick west wall, to come out in the inner ward, where the jousting would be held. Viewing stands had raised for all those who had come to watch, with four long tilting barriers in between. Lord Nestor’s men were painting the barriers with whitewash, draping the stands with bright banners, and hanging shields on the gate the competitors would pass through when they made their entrance.\n\nAt the north end of the yard, three quintains had been set up, and some of the competitors were riding at them. Alayne knew them by their shields; the bells of Belmore, green vipers for the Lynderlys, the red sledge of Breakstone, House Tollett’s black and grey pily. Ser Mychel Redfort set one quintain spinning with a perfectly placed blow. He was one of those favored to win wings.\n\nPetyr was not at the quintains, nor anywhere in the yard, but as she turned to go a woman’s voice called out. “Alayne!” cried Myranda Royce, from a carved stone bench beneath a beech tree, where she was seated between two men. She looked in need of rescue. Smiling, Alayne walked toward her friend.\n\nMyranda was wearing a grey woolen dress, a green hooded cloak, and a rather desperate look. On either side of her sat a knight. The one on her right had a grizzled beard, a bald head, and a belly that spilled over his swordbelt where his lap should have been. The one on her left was no more than eighteen, and skinny as a spear. His ginger-colored whiskers only partially served to disguise the angry red pimples that dotted his face.\n\nThe bald knight wore a dark blue surcoat emblazoned with a huge pair of pink lips. The pimply-gingerlad countered with nine white seagulls on a field of brown, which marked him for a Shett of Gulltown. He was staring so intently at Myranda’s breasts that he hardly noticed Alayne until Myranda rose to hug her. “Thank you, thank you, thank you ” Randa whispered in her ear, before she turned to say, “Sers, may I present you the Lady Alayne Stone?”\n\n“The Lord Protector’s daughter,” the bald knight announced, all hearty gallantry. He rose ponderously. “And full as lovely as the tales told of her, I see.”\n\nNot to be outdone, the pimply knight hopped up and said,  “Ser Ossifer speaks truly, you are the most beautiful maid in all the Seven Kingdoms.” It might have been a sweeter courtesy had he not addressed it to her chest.\n\n“And have you seen all those maids yourself, ser?” Alayne asked him. “You are young to be so widely travelled.”\n\nHe blushed, which only made his pimples look angrier.  “No, my lady.   I am from Gulltown.”\n\nAnd I am not, though Alayne was born there. She would need to be careful around this one. “I remember Gulltown fondly,” she told him, with a smile as vague as it was pleasant. To Myranda she said, “Do you know where my father’s gotten to, perchance?”\n\n“Let me take you to him, my lady.”\n\n“I do hope you will forgive me for depriving you of Lady Myranda’s company,” Alayne told the knights. She did not wait for a reply, but took the older girl arm-in-arm and drew her away from the bench. Only when they were out of earshot did she whisper,  “Do you really know where my father is?”\n\n“Of course not. Walk faster, my new suitors may be following.” Myranda made a face. “Ossifer Lipps is the dullest knight in the Vale, but Uther Shett aspires to his laurels. I am praying they fight a duel for my hand, and kill each other.”\n\nAlayne giggled. “Surely Lord Nestor would not seriously entertain a suit from such men.”\n\n“Oh, he might. My lord father is annoyed with me for killing my last husband and putting him to all this trouble.”\n\n“It was not your fault he died.”\n\n“There was no one else in the bed that I recall.”\n\nAlayne could not help but shutter. Myranda’s husband had died when he was making love with her. “Those Sistermen who came in yesterday were gallant,” she said, to change the subject. “If you don’t like Ser Ossifer or Ser Uther, marry one of them instead. I thought the youngest one was very handsome.”\n\n“The one in the sealskin cloak?” Randa said, incredulous.\n\n“One of his brothers, then.”\n\nMyranda rolled her eyes. “They’re from the Sisters. Did you ever know a Sisterman who could joust? They clean their swords with codfish oil and wash in tubs of cold seawater.”\n\n“Well,” Alayne said, “at least they’re clean.”\n\n“Some of them have webs between their toes. I’d sooner marry Lord Petyr. Then I’d be your mother. How little is his finger, I ask you?”\n\nAlayne did not dignify that question with an answer. “Lady Waynwood will be here soon, with her sons.”\n\n“Is that a promise or a threat?” Myranda said. “The first Lady Waynwood must have been a mare, I think. How else to explain why all the Waynwood men are horse-faced? If I were ever to wed a Waynwood, he would have to swear a vow to don his helm whenever he wished to fuck me, and keep the visor closed.” She gave Alayne a pinch on the arm. “My Harry will be with them, though. I notice that you left him out. I shall never forgive you for stealing him away from me. He’s the boy I want to marry.”\n\n“The betrothal was my father’s doing,”  Alayne protested, as she had a hundred times before.  She is only teasing, she told herself… but behind the japes, she could hear the hurt.\n\nMyranda stopped to gaze across the yard at the knights at their practice. “Now there’s the very sort of husband I need.”\n\nA few feet away, two knights were fighting with blunted practice swords. Their blades crashed together twice, then slipped past each other only to be blocked by upraised shields, but the bigger man gave ground at the impact. Alayne could not see the front of his shield from where she stood, but his attacker bore three ravens in flight, each clutching a red heart in its claws. Three hearts and three ravens.\n\nShe knew right then how the fight would end.\n\nA few moments later and the big man sprawled dazed in the dust with his helm askew. When his squire undid the fastenings to bare his head, there was blood trickling down his scalp. If the swords had not been blunted, there would be brains as well. That last head blow had been so hard Alayne had winced in sympathy when it fell. Myranda Royce considered the victor thoughtfully.  “Do you think if I asked nicely Ser Lyn would kill my suitors for me?”\n\n“He might, for a plump bag of gold.” Ser Lyn Corbray was forever desperately short of coin, all the Vale knew that.\n\n“Alas, all I have is a plump pair of teats. Though with Ser Lyn, a plump sausage under my skirts would serve me better.”\n\nAlayne’s giggle drew Corbray’s attention. He handed his shield to his loutish squire, removed his helm and quilted coif.  “Ladies.” His long brown hair was plastered to his brow by sweat.\n\n“Well struck, Ser Lyn,” Alayne called out. “Though I fear you’ve knocked poor Ser Owen insensible.”\n\nCorbray glanced back to where his foe was being helped from the yard by his squire. “He had no sense to start with, or he should not have tried me.”\n\nThere is truth in that, Alayne thought, but some demon of mischief was in her that morning, so she gave Ser Lyn a thrust of her own. Smiling sweetly, she said, “My lord father tells me your brother’s new wife is with child.”\n\nCorbray gave her a dark look. “Lyonel sends his regrets. He remains at Heart’s Home with his peddler’s daughter, watching her belly swell as if he were the first man who ever got a wench pregnant.”\n\nOh, that’s an open wound, thought Alayne. Lyonel Corbray’s first wife had given him nothing but a frail, sickly babe who died in infancy, and during all those years Ser Lyn had remained his brother’s heir. When the poor woman finally died, however, Petyr Baelish had stepped in and brokered a new marriage for Lord Corbray. The second Lady Corbray was sixteen, the daughter of a wealthy Gulltown merchant, but she had come with an immense dowry, and men said she was a tall, strapping, healthy girl, with big breasts and good, wide hips. And fertile too, it seems.\n\n“We are all praying that the Mother grants Lady Corbray an easy labor and a healthy child,” said Myranda.\n\nAlayne could not help herself. She smiled and said, “My father is always pleased to be of service to one of Lord Robert’s leal bannermen. I’m sure he would be most delighted to help broker a marriage for you as well, Ser Lyn.”\n\n“How kind of him.” Corbray’s lips drew back in something that might have been meant as a smile, though it gave Alayne a chill. “But what need have I for heirs when I am landless and like to remain so, thanks to our Lord Protector?  No.  Tell your lord father I need none of his brood mares.”\n\nThe venom in his voice was so thick that for a moment she almost forgot that Lyn Corbray was actually her father’s catspaw, bought and paid for. Or was he?  Perhaps, instead of being Petyr’s man pretending to be Petyr’s foe, he was actually his foe pretending to be his man pretending to be his foe.\n\nJust thinking about it was enough to make her head spin. Alayne turned abruptly from the yard… and bumped into a short, sharp-faced man with a brush of orange hair who had come up behind her.  His hand shot out and caught her arm before she could fall.   “My lady.  My pardons if I took you unawares.”\n\n“The fault was mine. I did not see you standing there.”\n\n“We mice are quiet creatures.” Ser Shadrich was so short that he might have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much older man. She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of his mouth, old battles in the scar beneath his ear, and a hardness behind the eyes that no boy would ever have. This was a man grown. Even Randa overtopped him, though.\n\n“Will you be seeking wings?” the Royce girl said.\n\n“A mouse with wings would be a silly sight.”\n\n“Perhaps you will try the melee instead?” Alayne suggested.  The melee was an afterthought, a sop for all the brothers, uncles, fathers, and friends who had accompanied the competitors to the Gates of the Moon to see them win their silver wings, but there would be prizes for the champions, and a chance to win ransoms.\n\n“A good melee is all a hedge knight can hope for, unless he stumbles on a bag of dragons. And that’s not likely, is it?”\n\n“I suppose not. But now you must excuse us, ser, we need to find my lord father. “\n\nHorns sounded from atop the wall.  “Too late,” Myranda said. “They’re here.  We shall need to do the honors by ourselves.”  She grinned.   “Last one to the gate must marry Uther Shett.”\n\nThey made a race of it, dashing headlong across the yard and past the stables, skirts flapping, whilst knights and serving men alike looked on, and pigs and chickens scattered before them. It was most unladylike, but Alayne sound found herself laughing. For just a little while, as she ran, she forget who she was, and where, and found herself remembering bright cold days at Winterfell, when she would race through Winterfell with her friend Jeyne Poole, with Arya running after them trying to keep up.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the gatehouse, both of them were red-faced and panting. Myranda had lost her cloak somewhere along the way. They were just in time. The portcullis had been raised, and a column of riders twenty strong were passing underneath. At their head rode Anya Waynwood, Lady of Ironoaks, stern and slim, her grey-brown hair bound up in a scarf. Her riding cloak was heavy green wool trimmed with brown fur, and clasped at the throat by a niello brooch in the shape of the broken wheel of her House.\n\nMyranda Royce stepped forward and sketched a curtsy. “Lady Anya. Welcome to the Gates of the Moon.”\n\n“Lady Myranda. Lady Alayne.” Anya Waynwood inclined her head to each of them in turn. “It is good of you to greet us. Allow me to present my grandson, Ser Roland Waynwood.”  She nodded at the knight who had spoken.  “And this is my youngest son, Ser Wallace Waynwood.  And of course my ward, Ser Harrold Hardyng.”\n\nHarry the Heir, Alayne thought. My husband-to-be, if he will have me.  A sudden terror filled her.  She wondered if her face was red. Don’t stare at him, she reminded herself, don’t stare, don’t gape, don’t gawk.  Look away. Her hair must be a frightful mess after all that running.  It took all her will to stop herself from trying to tuck the loose strands back into place. Never mind your stupid hair.  Your hair doesn’t matter.  It’s him that matters.  Him, and the Waynwoods.\n\nSer Roland was the oldest of the three, though no more than five-and-twenty. He was taller and more muscular than Ser Wallace, but both were long-faced and lantern-jawed, with stringy brown hair and pinched noses.  Horsefaced and homely, Alayne thought.\n\nHarry, though…\n\nMy Harry.  My lord, my lover, my betrothed.\n\nSer Harrold Hardyng looked every inch a lord-in-waiting; clean-limbed and handsome, straight as a lance, hard with muscle. Men old enough to have known Jon Arryn in his youth said Ser Harrold had his look, she knew. He had a mop of sandy blond hair, pale blue eyes, an aquiline nose. Joffrey was comely too, though, she reminded herself.   A comely monster, that’s what he was.  Little Lord Tyrion was kinder, twisted though he was.\n\nHarry was staring at her. He knows who I am, she realized, and he does not seem pleased to see me. It was only then that she took note of his heraldry. Though his surcoat and horse trappings were patterned in the red-and-white diamonds of House Hardyng, his shield was quartered. The arms of Hardyng and Waynwood were displayed in the first and third quarters, respectively, but in the second and fourth quarters he bore the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky blue and cream. Sweetrobin will not like that.\n\nSer Wallace said, “Are we the l-l-last?”\n\n“You are, sers,” replied Myranda Royce, taking absolutely no notice of his stammer.\n\n“Wh-wh-when will the t-t-tilts commence?”\n\n“Oh, soon, I pray,” said Randa. “Some of the competitors have been here for almost a moon’s turn, partaking of my father’s meat and mead. All good fellows, and very brave… but they do eat rather a lot.”\n\nThe Waynwoods laughed, and even Harry the Heir cracked a thin smile. “It was snowing in the passes, else we would have been here sooner,” said Lady Anya.\n\n“Had we known such beauty awaited us at the Gates, we would have flown,” Ser Roland said.  Though his words were addressed to Myranda Royce, he smiled at Alayne as he said them.\n\n“To fly you would need wings,” Randa replied, “and there are some knights here who might have a thing to say concerning that.”\n\n“I look forward to a spirited discussion.” Ser Roland swung down from his horse, turned to Alayne, and smiled.  “I had heard that Lord Littlefinger’s daughter was fair of face and full of grace, but no one ever told me that she was a thief.”\n\n“You wrong me, ser. I am no thief!”\n\nSer Roland placed his hand over his heart. “Then how do you explain this hole in my chest, from where you stole my heart?”\n\n“He is only t-teasing you, my lady,” stammered Ser Wallace. “My n-n-nephew never had a h-h-heart.”\n\n“The Waynwood wheel has a broken spoke, and we have my nuncle here.” Ser Roland gave Wallace a whap behind the ear.  “Squires should be quiet when knights are speaking.”\n\nSer Wallace reddened.  “I am no more a s-squire, my lady.  My n-nephew knows full well that I was k-k-kni-k-k-kni –“\n\n“Dubbed?” Alayne suggested gently.\n\n“Dubbed,” said Wallace Waynwood, gratefully.\n\nRobb would be his age, if he were still alive, she could not help but think, but Robb died a king, and this is just a boy.\n\n“My lord father has assigned you rooms in the East Tower,” Lady Myranda was telling Lady Waynwood, “but I fear your knights will need to share a bed. The Gates of the Moon were never meant to house so many noble visitors.”\n\n“You are in the Falcon Tower, Ser Harrold,” Alayne put in. Far away from Sweetrobin. That was intentional, she knew. Petyr Baelish did not leave such things to chance. “If it please you, I will show you to your chambers myself.” This time her eyes met Harry’s.  She smiled just for him, and said a silent prayer to the Maiden. Please, he doesn’t need to love me, just make him like me, just a little, that would be enough for now.\n\nSer Harrold looked down at her coldly. “Why should it please me to be escorted anywhere by Littlefinger’s bastard?”\n\nAll three Waynwoods looked at him askance. “You are a guest here, Harry,” Lady Anya reminded him, in a frosty voice. “See that you remember that.”\n\nA lady’s armor is her courtesy. Alayne could feel the blood rushing to her face. No tears, she prayed. Please, please, I must not cry. “As you wish, ser. And now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger’s bastard must find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can begin the tourney on the morrow.”  And may your horse stumble, Harry the Heir, so you fall on your stupid head in your first tilt. She showed the Waynwoods a stone face as they blurted out awkward apologies for their companion. When they were done she turned and fled.\n\nNear the keep, she ran headlong into Ser Lothor Brune and almost knocked him off his feet. “Harry the Heir?  Harry the Arse, I say. He’s just some upjumped squire.”\n\nAlayne was so grateful that she hugged him. “Thank you. Have you seen my father, ser?”\n\n“Down in the vaults, ” Ser Lothar said, “inspecting Lord Nestor’s granaries with Lord Grafton and Lord Belmore.”\n\nThe vaults were large and dark and filthy. Alayne lit a taper and clutched her skirt as she made the descent. Near the bottom, she heard Lord Grafton’s booming voice, and followed.”The merchants are clamoring to buy, and the lords are clamoring to sell,” the Gulltowner was saying when she found them.  Though not a tall man, Grafton was wide, with thick arms and shoulders.  His hair was a dirty blond mop.  “How am I to stop that, my lord?”\n\n“Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does not matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale. “\n\n“These prices, though,”  protested fat Lord Belmore,”  these prices are more than fair.”\n\n“You say more than fair, my lord.  I say less than we would wish.  Wait.  If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored.  Winter is coming.  Prices must go higher.”\n\n“Perhaps,”  said Belmore, doubtfully.\n\n“Bronze Yohn will not wait, ”  Grafton complained.  “He need not ship through Gulltown, he has his own ports.  Whilst we are hoarding our harvest, Royce and the other Lords Declarant will turn theirs into silver, you may be sure of that.”\n\n“Let us hope so,”  said Petyr.  “When their granaries are empty, they will need every scrap of that silver to buy sustenance from us.  And now if you will excuse me, my lord, it would seem my daughter has need of me.”\n\n“Lady Alayne,” Lord Grafton said. “You look bright-eyed this morning.”\n\n“You are kind to say so, my lord. Father, I am sorry to disturb you, but I thought you would want to know that the Waynwoods have arrived.”\n\n“And is Ser Harrold with them?”\n\nHorrible Ser Harrold.  “ He is.”\n\nLord Belmore laughed. “I never thought Royce would let him come. Is he blind, or merely stupid?”\n\n“He is honorable.  Sometimes it amounts to the same thing.  If he denied the lad the chance to prove himself, it could create a rift between them, so why not let him tilt?  The boy is nowise skilled enough to win a place amongst the Winged Knights.”\n\n“I suppose not,” said Belmore, grudgingly.  Lord Grafton kissed Alayne on the hand, and the two lords went off, leaving her alone with her lord father.\n\n“Come,” Petyr said, “walk with me.”  He took her by the arm and led her deeper into the vaults, past an empty dungeon.  “And how was your first meeting with Harry the Heir?”\n\n“He’s horrible.”\n\n“The world is full of horrors, sweet.  By now you ought to know that.  You’ve seen enough of them.”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “but why must he be so cruel?  He called me your bastard.  Right in the yard, in front of everyone.”\n\n“So far as he knows, that’s who you are.  This betrothal was never his idea, and Bronze Yohn has no doubt warned him against my wiles.  You are my daughter.  He does not trust you, and he believes that you’re beneath him.”\n\n“Well, I’m not.  He may think he’s some great knight, but Ser Lothor says he’s just some upjumped squire.”\n\nPetyr put his arm around her.  “So he is, but he is Robert’s heir as well.  Bringing Harry here was the first step in our plan, but now we need to keep him, and only you can do that.  He has a weakness for a pretty face, and whose face is prettier than yours?  Charm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.”\n\n“I don’t know how,”  she said miserably.\n\n“Oh, I think you do,” said Littlefinger, with one of those smiles that did not reach his eyes.  “You will be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight, as lovely as your lady mother at your age.  I cannot seat you on the dais, but you’ll have a place of honor above the salt and underneath a wall sconce.  The fire will be shining in your hair, so everyone will see how fair of face you are.  Keep a good long spoon on hand to beat the squires off, sweetling.  You will not want green boys underfoot when the knights come round to beg you for your favor.”\n\n“Who would ask to wear a bastard’s favor?”\n\n“Harry, if he has the wits the gods gave a goose… but do not give it to him.  Choose some other gallant, and favor him instead.  You do not want to seem too eager.”\n\n“No,” Alayne said.\n\n“Lady Waynwood will insist that Harry dance with you, I can promise you that much.  That will be your chance. Smile at the boy.  Touch him when you speak.  Tease him, to pique his pride.  If he seems to be responding, tell him that you are feeling faint, and ask him to take you outside for a breath of fresh air.  No knight could refuse such a request from a fair maiden.”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “but he thinks that I’m a bastard.”\n\n“A beautiful bastard, and the Lord Protector’s daughter.”  Petyr drew her close and kissed her on both cheeks.  “The night belongs to you, sweetling, Remember that, always.”\n\n“I’ll try, father,” she said.\n\nThe feast proved to be everything her father promised.\n\nSixty-four dishes were served, in honor of the sixty-four competitors who had come so far to contest for silver wings before their lord. From the rivers and the lakes came pike and trout and salmon, from the seas crabs and cod and herring. Ducks there were, and capons, peacocks in their plumage and swans in almond milk. Suckling pigs were served up crackling with apples in their mouths, and three huge aurochs were roasted whole above firepits in the castle yard, since they were too big to get through the kitchen doors. Loaves of hot bread filled the trestle tables in Lord Nestor’s hall, and massive wheels of cheese were brought up from the vaults.  The butter was fresh-churned, and there were leeks and carrots, roasted onions, beets, turnips, parsnips.  And best of all, Lord Nestor’s cooks prepared a splendid subtlety, a lemon cake in the shape of the Giant’s Lance, twelve feet tall and adorned with an Eyrie made of sugar.\n\nFor me, Alayne thought, as they wheeled it out.  Sweetrobin loved lemon cakes too, but only after she told him that they were her favorites.  The cake had required every lemon in the Vale, but Petyr had promised that he would send to Dorne for more.\n\nThere were gifts as well, splendid gifts.  Each of the competitors received a cloak of cloth-of-silver and a lapis brooch in the shape of a pair of falcon’s wings.  Fine steel daggers were given to the brothers, fathers, and friends who had come to watch them tilt.  For their mothers, sisters, and ladies fair there were bolts of silk and Myrish lace.\n\n“Lord Nestor has an open hand,” Alayne heard Ser Edmund Breakstone say.  “An open hand and a little finger,” Lady Waynwood replied, with a nod toward Petyr Baelish.   Breakstone was not slow to take her meaning.  The true source of this largesse was not Lord Nestor, but the Lord Protector.\n\nWhen the last course had been served and cleared, the tables were lifted from their trestles to clear the floor for dancing, and musicians were brought in.\n\n“Are there no singers?” asked Ben Coldwater.\n\n“The little lord cannot abide them,” Ser Lymond Lynderly replied.  “Not since Marillion.”\n\n“Ah… that was the man who murdered Lady Lysa, yes?”\n\nAlayne spoke up. “His singing pleased her greatly, and she showed him too much favor, perhaps.  When she wed my father he went mad and pushed her out the Moon Door.  Lord Robert has hated singing ever since.  He is still fond of music, though.”\n\n“As am I,” Coldwater said.  Rising, he offered Alayne his hand.  “Would you honor me with this dance, my lady?”\n\n“You’re very kind,” she said, as he led her to the floor.\n\nHe was her first partner of the evening, but far from the last.  Just as Petyr had promised, the young knights flocked around her, vying for her favor.  After Ben came Andrew Tollett, handsome Ser Byron, red-nosed Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse.  Then Ser Albar Royce, Myranda’s stout dull brother and Lord Nestor’s heir.  She danced with all three Sunderlands, none of whom had webs between their fingers, though she could not vouch for their toes.  Uther Shett appeared to pay her slimy compliments as he trod upon her feet, but Ser Targon the Halfwild proved to be the soul of courtesy.  After that Ser Roland Waynwood swept her up and made her laugh with mocking comments about half the other knights in the hall.  His uncle Wallace took a turn as well and tried to do the same, but the words would not come.  Alayne finally took pity on him and began to chatter happily, to spare him the embarrassment.  When the dance was done she excused herself, and went back to her place to have a drink of wine.\n\nAnd there he stood, Harry the Heir himself; tall, handsome, scowling.  “Lady Alayne. May I partner you in this dance?”\n\nShe considered for a moment. “No. I don’t think so.”\n\nColor rose to his cheeks.  “I was unforgiveably rude to you in the yard.  You must forgive me.”\n\n“Must?” She tossed her hair, took a sip of wine, made him wait.  “How can you forgive someone who is unforgiveably rude?  Will you explain that to me, ser?”\n\nSer Harrold looked confused. “Please.  One dance.”\n\nCharm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.  “If you insist.”\n\nHe nodded, offered his arm, led her out onto the floor.  As they waited for the music to resume, Alayne glanced at the dais, where Lord Robert sat staring at them.  Please, she prayed, don’t let him start to twitch and shake.  Not here.  Not now.  Maester Coleman would have made certain that he drank a strong dose of sweetmilk before the feast, but even so.\n\nThen the musicians took up a tune, and she was dancing.\n\nSay something, she urged herself.  You will never make Ser Harry love you if you don’t have the courage to talk him.  Should she tell him what a good dancer he was?  No, he’s probably heard that a dozen times tonight.  Besides, Petyr said that I should not seem eager.  Instead she said, “I have heard that you are about to be a father.”  It was not something most girls would say to their almost-betrothed, but she wanted to see if Ser Harrold would lie.\n\n“For the second time. My daughter Alys is two years old.”\n\nYour bastard daughter Alys, Alayne thought, but what she said was, “That one had a different mother, though.”\n\n“Yes. Cissy was a pretty thing when I tumbled her, but childbirth left her as fat as a cow, so Lady Anya arranged for her to marry one of her men-at-arms.  It is different with Saffron.”\n\n“Saffron?”  Alayne tried not to laugh.  “Truly?”\n\nSer Harrold had the grace to blush.  “Her father says she is more precious to him than gold.  He’s rich, the richest man in Gulltown.  A fortune in spices.”\n\n“What will you name the babe?” she asked.  “Cinnamon if she’s a girl?  Cloves if he’s a boy?”\n\nThat almost made him stumble.  “My lady japes.”\n\n“Oh, no.”  Petyr will howl when I tell him what I said.\n\n“Saffron is very beautiful, I’ll have you know.  Tall and slim, with big brown eyes and hair like honey.”\n\nAlayne raised her head.  “More beautiful than me?”\n\nSer Harrold studied her face. “You are comely enough, I grant you.  When Lady Anya first told me of this match, I was afraid that you might look like your father.”\n\n“Little pointy beard and all?”  Alayne laughed.\n\n“I never meant… “\n\n“I hope you joust better than you talk.”\n\nFor a moment he looked shocked.  But as the song was ending, he burst into a laugh.  “No one told me you were clever.”\n\nHe has good teeth, she thought, straight and white.  And when he smiles, he has the nicest dimples.  She ran one finger down his cheek.  “Should we ever wed, you’ll have to send Saffron back to her father.  I’ll be all the spice you’ll want.”\n\nHe grinned.  “I will hold you to that promise, my lady.  Until that day, may I wear your favor in the tourney?”\n\n“You may not.  It is promised to… another.”  She was not sure who as yet, but she knew she would find someone.\n","source":"_posts/ALAYNE.md","raw":"---\ntitle: ALAYNE\ndate: 2016-04-06 20:59:24\ntags: 冰与火之歌\ncomments: false\n---\n## ALAYNE\\--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\n\nShe was reading her little lord a tale of the Winged Knight when Mya Stone came knocking on the door of his bedchamber, clad in boots and riding leathers and smelling strongly of the stable. Mya had straw in her hair and a scowl on her face. That scowl comes of having Mychel Redfort near, Alayne knew.\n\n“Your lordship,” Mya informed Lord Robert, “Lady Waynwood’s banners have been seen an hour down the road. She will be here soon, with your cousin Harry. Will you want to greet them?”\n\nWhy did she have to mention Harry? Alayne thought. We will never get Sweetrobin out of bed now. The boy slapped a pillow. “Send them away. I never asked them here.”\n<!-- more -->\nMya looked nonplussed. No one in the Vale was better at handling a mule, but lordlings were another matter. “They were invited,” she said uncertainly, “for the tourney. I don’t… “\n\nAlayne closed her book.  “Thank you, Mya. Let me talk with Lord Robert, if you would.”\n\nRelief plain on her face, Mya fled without another word.\n\n“I hate that Harry,” Sweetrobin said when she was gone. “He calls me cousin, but he’s just waiting for me to die so he can take the Eyrie. He thinks I don’t know, but I do.”\n\n“Your lordship should not believe such nonsense,” Alayne said. “I’m sure Ser Harrold loves you well.” And if the gods are good, he will love me too. Her tummy gave a little flutter.\n\n“He doesn’t,” Lord Robert insisted. “He wants my father’s castle, that’s all, so he pretends.” The boy clutched the blanket to his pimply chest. “I don’t want you to marry him, Alayne. I am the Lord of the Eyrie, and I forbid it.” He sounded as if he were about to cry. “You should marry me instead. We could sleep in the same bed every night, and you could read me stories.”\n\nNo man can wed me so long as my dwarf husband still lives somewhere in this world. Queen Cersei had collected the head of a dozen dwarfs, Petyr claimed, but none were Tyrion’s. “Sweetrobin, you must not say such things. You are the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, and you must wed a highborn lady and father a son to sit in the High Hall of House Arryn after you are gone.”\n\nRobert wiped his nose. “But I want — “\n\nShe put a finger to his lips. “I know what you want, but it cannot be. I am no fit wife for you. I am bastard born.”\n\n“I don’t care. I love you best of anyone. “\n\nYou are such a little fool.  “Your lords bannermen will care. Some call my father upjumped and ambitious. If you were to take me to wife, they would say that he made you do it, that it was no will of yours. The Lords Declarant might take arms against him once again, and he and I should both be put to death.”\n\n“I wouldn’t let them hurt you!” Lord Robert said. “If they try I will make them all fly.” His hand began to tremble.\n\nAlayne stroked his fingers. “There, my Sweetrobin, be still now.” When the shaking passed, she said, “You must have a proper wife, a trueborn maid of noble birth.”\n\n“No. I want to marry you, Alayne.”\n\nOnce your lady mother intended that very thing, but I was trueborn then, and noble. “My lord is kind to say so.” Alayne smoothed his hair. Lady Lysa had never let the servants touch it, and after she had died Robert had suffered terrible shaking fits whenever anyone came near him with a blade, so it had been allowed to grow until it tumbled over his round shoulders and halfway down his flabby white chest. He does have pretty hair.  If the gods are good and he lives long enough to wed, his wife will admire his hair, surely.  That much she will love about him. “Any child of ours would be baseborn. Only a trueborn child of House Arryn can displace Ser Harrold as your heir. My father will find a proper wife for you, some highborn girl much prettier than me. You’ll hunt and hawk together, and she’ll give you her favor to wear in tournaments. Before long, you will have forgotten me entirely.”\n\n“I won’t!”\n\n“You will. You must.” Her voice was firm, but gentle.\n\n“The Lord of the Eyrie can do as he likes. Can’t I still love you, even if I have to marry her? Ser Harrold has a common woman. Benjicot says she’s carrying his bastard.”\n\nBenjicot should learn to keep his fool’s mouth shut. “Is that what you would have from me? A bastard?” She pulled her fingers from his grasp. “Would you dishonor me that way?”\n\nThe boy looked stricken. “No. I never meant — “\n\nAlayne stood. “If it please my lord, I must go and find my father. Someone needs to greet Lady Waynwood.” Before her little lord could find the words to protest, she gave him a quick curtsy and fled the bedchamber, sweeping down the hall and across a covered bridge to the Lord Protector’s apartments.\n\nWhen she had left Petyr Baelish that morning he had been breaking his fast with old Oswell who had arrived last night from Gulltown on a lathered horse. She hoped they might still be talking, but Petyr’s solar proved empty. Someone had left a window open and a stack of papers had blown onto the floor. The sun was slanting through the thick yellow windows, and dust motes danced in the light like tiny golden insects. Though snow had blanketed the heights of the Giant’s Lance above, below the mountain the autumn lingered and winter wheat was ripening in the fields.  Outside the window she could hear the laughter of the washerwomen at the well, the din of steel on steel from the ward where the knights were at their drills. Good sounds.\n\nAlayne loved it here. She felt alive again, for the first since her father… since Lord Eddard Stark had died.\n\nShe closed the window, gathered up the fallen papers, and stacked them on the table. One was a list of the competitors. Four-and-sixty knights had been invited to vie for places amongst Lord Robert Arryn’s  new Brotherhood of Winged Knights, and four­ and-sixty knights had come to tilt for the right to wear falcon’s wings upon their warhelms and guard their lord.\n\nThe competitors came from all over the Vale, from the mountain valleys and the coast, from Gulltown and the Bloody Gate, even the Three Sisters. Though a few were promised, only three were wed; the eight victors would be expected to spend the next three years at Lord Robert’s side, as his own personal guard (Alayne had suggested seven, like the Kingsguard, but Sweetrobin had insisted that he must have more knights than King Tommen), so older men with wives and children had not been invited.\n\nAnd they came, Alayne thought proudly. They all came.\n\nIt had fallen out just as Petyr said it would, the day the ravens flew. “They’re young, eager, hungry for adventure and renown. Lysa would not let them go to war. This is the next best thing. A chance to serve their lord and prove their prowess. They will come. Even Harry the Heir.” He had smoothed her hair and kissed her forehead. “What a clever daughter you are.”\n\nIt was clever. The tourney, the prizes, the winged knights, it had all been her own notion. Lord Robert’s mother had filled him full of fears, but he always took courage from the tales she read him of Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight of legend, founder of his line. Why not surround him with Winged Knights?  She had thought one night, after Sweetrobin had finally drifted off to sleep. His own Kingsguard, to keep him safe and make him brave. And no sooner did she tell Petyr her idea than he went out and made it happen. He will want to be there to greet Ser Harrold. Where could he have gone?\n\nAlayne swept down the tower stairs to enter the pillared gallery at the back of the Great Hall. Below her, serving men were setting up trestle tables for the evening feast, while their wives and daughters swept up the old rushes and scattered fresh ones. Lord Nestor was showing Lady Waxley his prize tapestries, with their scenes of hunt and chase. The same panels had once hung in the Red Keep of King’s Landing, when Robert sat the Iron Throne. Joffrey had them taken down and they had languished in some cellar until Petyr Baelish arranged for them to be brought to the Vale as a gift for Nestor Royce. Not only were the hangings beautiful, but the High Steward delighted in telling anyone who’d listen that they had once belonged to a king.\n\nPetyr was not in the Great Hall. Alayne crossed the gallery and descended the stair built into the thick west wall, to come out in the inner ward, where the jousting would be held. Viewing stands had raised for all those who had come to watch, with four long tilting barriers in between. Lord Nestor’s men were painting the barriers with whitewash, draping the stands with bright banners, and hanging shields on the gate the competitors would pass through when they made their entrance.\n\nAt the north end of the yard, three quintains had been set up, and some of the competitors were riding at them. Alayne knew them by their shields; the bells of Belmore, green vipers for the Lynderlys, the red sledge of Breakstone, House Tollett’s black and grey pily. Ser Mychel Redfort set one quintain spinning with a perfectly placed blow. He was one of those favored to win wings.\n\nPetyr was not at the quintains, nor anywhere in the yard, but as she turned to go a woman’s voice called out. “Alayne!” cried Myranda Royce, from a carved stone bench beneath a beech tree, where she was seated between two men. She looked in need of rescue. Smiling, Alayne walked toward her friend.\n\nMyranda was wearing a grey woolen dress, a green hooded cloak, and a rather desperate look. On either side of her sat a knight. The one on her right had a grizzled beard, a bald head, and a belly that spilled over his swordbelt where his lap should have been. The one on her left was no more than eighteen, and skinny as a spear. His ginger-colored whiskers only partially served to disguise the angry red pimples that dotted his face.\n\nThe bald knight wore a dark blue surcoat emblazoned with a huge pair of pink lips. The pimply-gingerlad countered with nine white seagulls on a field of brown, which marked him for a Shett of Gulltown. He was staring so intently at Myranda’s breasts that he hardly noticed Alayne until Myranda rose to hug her. “Thank you, thank you, thank you ” Randa whispered in her ear, before she turned to say, “Sers, may I present you the Lady Alayne Stone?”\n\n“The Lord Protector’s daughter,” the bald knight announced, all hearty gallantry. He rose ponderously. “And full as lovely as the tales told of her, I see.”\n\nNot to be outdone, the pimply knight hopped up and said,  “Ser Ossifer speaks truly, you are the most beautiful maid in all the Seven Kingdoms.” It might have been a sweeter courtesy had he not addressed it to her chest.\n\n“And have you seen all those maids yourself, ser?” Alayne asked him. “You are young to be so widely travelled.”\n\nHe blushed, which only made his pimples look angrier.  “No, my lady.   I am from Gulltown.”\n\nAnd I am not, though Alayne was born there. She would need to be careful around this one. “I remember Gulltown fondly,” she told him, with a smile as vague as it was pleasant. To Myranda she said, “Do you know where my father’s gotten to, perchance?”\n\n“Let me take you to him, my lady.”\n\n“I do hope you will forgive me for depriving you of Lady Myranda’s company,” Alayne told the knights. She did not wait for a reply, but took the older girl arm-in-arm and drew her away from the bench. Only when they were out of earshot did she whisper,  “Do you really know where my father is?”\n\n“Of course not. Walk faster, my new suitors may be following.” Myranda made a face. “Ossifer Lipps is the dullest knight in the Vale, but Uther Shett aspires to his laurels. I am praying they fight a duel for my hand, and kill each other.”\n\nAlayne giggled. “Surely Lord Nestor would not seriously entertain a suit from such men.”\n\n“Oh, he might. My lord father is annoyed with me for killing my last husband and putting him to all this trouble.”\n\n“It was not your fault he died.”\n\n“There was no one else in the bed that I recall.”\n\nAlayne could not help but shutter. Myranda’s husband had died when he was making love with her. “Those Sistermen who came in yesterday were gallant,” she said, to change the subject. “If you don’t like Ser Ossifer or Ser Uther, marry one of them instead. I thought the youngest one was very handsome.”\n\n“The one in the sealskin cloak?” Randa said, incredulous.\n\n“One of his brothers, then.”\n\nMyranda rolled her eyes. “They’re from the Sisters. Did you ever know a Sisterman who could joust? They clean their swords with codfish oil and wash in tubs of cold seawater.”\n\n“Well,” Alayne said, “at least they’re clean.”\n\n“Some of them have webs between their toes. I’d sooner marry Lord Petyr. Then I’d be your mother. How little is his finger, I ask you?”\n\nAlayne did not dignify that question with an answer. “Lady Waynwood will be here soon, with her sons.”\n\n“Is that a promise or a threat?” Myranda said. “The first Lady Waynwood must have been a mare, I think. How else to explain why all the Waynwood men are horse-faced? If I were ever to wed a Waynwood, he would have to swear a vow to don his helm whenever he wished to fuck me, and keep the visor closed.” She gave Alayne a pinch on the arm. “My Harry will be with them, though. I notice that you left him out. I shall never forgive you for stealing him away from me. He’s the boy I want to marry.”\n\n“The betrothal was my father’s doing,”  Alayne protested, as she had a hundred times before.  She is only teasing, she told herself… but behind the japes, she could hear the hurt.\n\nMyranda stopped to gaze across the yard at the knights at their practice. “Now there’s the very sort of husband I need.”\n\nA few feet away, two knights were fighting with blunted practice swords. Their blades crashed together twice, then slipped past each other only to be blocked by upraised shields, but the bigger man gave ground at the impact. Alayne could not see the front of his shield from where she stood, but his attacker bore three ravens in flight, each clutching a red heart in its claws. Three hearts and three ravens.\n\nShe knew right then how the fight would end.\n\nA few moments later and the big man sprawled dazed in the dust with his helm askew. When his squire undid the fastenings to bare his head, there was blood trickling down his scalp. If the swords had not been blunted, there would be brains as well. That last head blow had been so hard Alayne had winced in sympathy when it fell. Myranda Royce considered the victor thoughtfully.  “Do you think if I asked nicely Ser Lyn would kill my suitors for me?”\n\n“He might, for a plump bag of gold.” Ser Lyn Corbray was forever desperately short of coin, all the Vale knew that.\n\n“Alas, all I have is a plump pair of teats. Though with Ser Lyn, a plump sausage under my skirts would serve me better.”\n\nAlayne’s giggle drew Corbray’s attention. He handed his shield to his loutish squire, removed his helm and quilted coif.  “Ladies.” His long brown hair was plastered to his brow by sweat.\n\n“Well struck, Ser Lyn,” Alayne called out. “Though I fear you’ve knocked poor Ser Owen insensible.”\n\nCorbray glanced back to where his foe was being helped from the yard by his squire. “He had no sense to start with, or he should not have tried me.”\n\nThere is truth in that, Alayne thought, but some demon of mischief was in her that morning, so she gave Ser Lyn a thrust of her own. Smiling sweetly, she said, “My lord father tells me your brother’s new wife is with child.”\n\nCorbray gave her a dark look. “Lyonel sends his regrets. He remains at Heart’s Home with his peddler’s daughter, watching her belly swell as if he were the first man who ever got a wench pregnant.”\n\nOh, that’s an open wound, thought Alayne. Lyonel Corbray’s first wife had given him nothing but a frail, sickly babe who died in infancy, and during all those years Ser Lyn had remained his brother’s heir. When the poor woman finally died, however, Petyr Baelish had stepped in and brokered a new marriage for Lord Corbray. The second Lady Corbray was sixteen, the daughter of a wealthy Gulltown merchant, but she had come with an immense dowry, and men said she was a tall, strapping, healthy girl, with big breasts and good, wide hips. And fertile too, it seems.\n\n“We are all praying that the Mother grants Lady Corbray an easy labor and a healthy child,” said Myranda.\n\nAlayne could not help herself. She smiled and said, “My father is always pleased to be of service to one of Lord Robert’s leal bannermen. I’m sure he would be most delighted to help broker a marriage for you as well, Ser Lyn.”\n\n“How kind of him.” Corbray’s lips drew back in something that might have been meant as a smile, though it gave Alayne a chill. “But what need have I for heirs when I am landless and like to remain so, thanks to our Lord Protector?  No.  Tell your lord father I need none of his brood mares.”\n\nThe venom in his voice was so thick that for a moment she almost forgot that Lyn Corbray was actually her father’s catspaw, bought and paid for. Or was he?  Perhaps, instead of being Petyr’s man pretending to be Petyr’s foe, he was actually his foe pretending to be his man pretending to be his foe.\n\nJust thinking about it was enough to make her head spin. Alayne turned abruptly from the yard… and bumped into a short, sharp-faced man with a brush of orange hair who had come up behind her.  His hand shot out and caught her arm before she could fall.   “My lady.  My pardons if I took you unawares.”\n\n“The fault was mine. I did not see you standing there.”\n\n“We mice are quiet creatures.” Ser Shadrich was so short that he might have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much older man. She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of his mouth, old battles in the scar beneath his ear, and a hardness behind the eyes that no boy would ever have. This was a man grown. Even Randa overtopped him, though.\n\n“Will you be seeking wings?” the Royce girl said.\n\n“A mouse with wings would be a silly sight.”\n\n“Perhaps you will try the melee instead?” Alayne suggested.  The melee was an afterthought, a sop for all the brothers, uncles, fathers, and friends who had accompanied the competitors to the Gates of the Moon to see them win their silver wings, but there would be prizes for the champions, and a chance to win ransoms.\n\n“A good melee is all a hedge knight can hope for, unless he stumbles on a bag of dragons. And that’s not likely, is it?”\n\n“I suppose not. But now you must excuse us, ser, we need to find my lord father. “\n\nHorns sounded from atop the wall.  “Too late,” Myranda said. “They’re here.  We shall need to do the honors by ourselves.”  She grinned.   “Last one to the gate must marry Uther Shett.”\n\nThey made a race of it, dashing headlong across the yard and past the stables, skirts flapping, whilst knights and serving men alike looked on, and pigs and chickens scattered before them. It was most unladylike, but Alayne sound found herself laughing. For just a little while, as she ran, she forget who she was, and where, and found herself remembering bright cold days at Winterfell, when she would race through Winterfell with her friend Jeyne Poole, with Arya running after them trying to keep up.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the gatehouse, both of them were red-faced and panting. Myranda had lost her cloak somewhere along the way. They were just in time. The portcullis had been raised, and a column of riders twenty strong were passing underneath. At their head rode Anya Waynwood, Lady of Ironoaks, stern and slim, her grey-brown hair bound up in a scarf. Her riding cloak was heavy green wool trimmed with brown fur, and clasped at the throat by a niello brooch in the shape of the broken wheel of her House.\n\nMyranda Royce stepped forward and sketched a curtsy. “Lady Anya. Welcome to the Gates of the Moon.”\n\n“Lady Myranda. Lady Alayne.” Anya Waynwood inclined her head to each of them in turn. “It is good of you to greet us. Allow me to present my grandson, Ser Roland Waynwood.”  She nodded at the knight who had spoken.  “And this is my youngest son, Ser Wallace Waynwood.  And of course my ward, Ser Harrold Hardyng.”\n\nHarry the Heir, Alayne thought. My husband-to-be, if he will have me.  A sudden terror filled her.  She wondered if her face was red. Don’t stare at him, she reminded herself, don’t stare, don’t gape, don’t gawk.  Look away. Her hair must be a frightful mess after all that running.  It took all her will to stop herself from trying to tuck the loose strands back into place. Never mind your stupid hair.  Your hair doesn’t matter.  It’s him that matters.  Him, and the Waynwoods.\n\nSer Roland was the oldest of the three, though no more than five-and-twenty. He was taller and more muscular than Ser Wallace, but both were long-faced and lantern-jawed, with stringy brown hair and pinched noses.  Horsefaced and homely, Alayne thought.\n\nHarry, though…\n\nMy Harry.  My lord, my lover, my betrothed.\n\nSer Harrold Hardyng looked every inch a lord-in-waiting; clean-limbed and handsome, straight as a lance, hard with muscle. Men old enough to have known Jon Arryn in his youth said Ser Harrold had his look, she knew. He had a mop of sandy blond hair, pale blue eyes, an aquiline nose. Joffrey was comely too, though, she reminded herself.   A comely monster, that’s what he was.  Little Lord Tyrion was kinder, twisted though he was.\n\nHarry was staring at her. He knows who I am, she realized, and he does not seem pleased to see me. It was only then that she took note of his heraldry. Though his surcoat and horse trappings were patterned in the red-and-white diamonds of House Hardyng, his shield was quartered. The arms of Hardyng and Waynwood were displayed in the first and third quarters, respectively, but in the second and fourth quarters he bore the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky blue and cream. Sweetrobin will not like that.\n\nSer Wallace said, “Are we the l-l-last?”\n\n“You are, sers,” replied Myranda Royce, taking absolutely no notice of his stammer.\n\n“Wh-wh-when will the t-t-tilts commence?”\n\n“Oh, soon, I pray,” said Randa. “Some of the competitors have been here for almost a moon’s turn, partaking of my father’s meat and mead. All good fellows, and very brave… but they do eat rather a lot.”\n\nThe Waynwoods laughed, and even Harry the Heir cracked a thin smile. “It was snowing in the passes, else we would have been here sooner,” said Lady Anya.\n\n“Had we known such beauty awaited us at the Gates, we would have flown,” Ser Roland said.  Though his words were addressed to Myranda Royce, he smiled at Alayne as he said them.\n\n“To fly you would need wings,” Randa replied, “and there are some knights here who might have a thing to say concerning that.”\n\n“I look forward to a spirited discussion.” Ser Roland swung down from his horse, turned to Alayne, and smiled.  “I had heard that Lord Littlefinger’s daughter was fair of face and full of grace, but no one ever told me that she was a thief.”\n\n“You wrong me, ser. I am no thief!”\n\nSer Roland placed his hand over his heart. “Then how do you explain this hole in my chest, from where you stole my heart?”\n\n“He is only t-teasing you, my lady,” stammered Ser Wallace. “My n-n-nephew never had a h-h-heart.”\n\n“The Waynwood wheel has a broken spoke, and we have my nuncle here.” Ser Roland gave Wallace a whap behind the ear.  “Squires should be quiet when knights are speaking.”\n\nSer Wallace reddened.  “I am no more a s-squire, my lady.  My n-nephew knows full well that I was k-k-kni-k-k-kni –“\n\n“Dubbed?” Alayne suggested gently.\n\n“Dubbed,” said Wallace Waynwood, gratefully.\n\nRobb would be his age, if he were still alive, she could not help but think, but Robb died a king, and this is just a boy.\n\n“My lord father has assigned you rooms in the East Tower,” Lady Myranda was telling Lady Waynwood, “but I fear your knights will need to share a bed. The Gates of the Moon were never meant to house so many noble visitors.”\n\n“You are in the Falcon Tower, Ser Harrold,” Alayne put in. Far away from Sweetrobin. That was intentional, she knew. Petyr Baelish did not leave such things to chance. “If it please you, I will show you to your chambers myself.” This time her eyes met Harry’s.  She smiled just for him, and said a silent prayer to the Maiden. Please, he doesn’t need to love me, just make him like me, just a little, that would be enough for now.\n\nSer Harrold looked down at her coldly. “Why should it please me to be escorted anywhere by Littlefinger’s bastard?”\n\nAll three Waynwoods looked at him askance. “You are a guest here, Harry,” Lady Anya reminded him, in a frosty voice. “See that you remember that.”\n\nA lady’s armor is her courtesy. Alayne could feel the blood rushing to her face. No tears, she prayed. Please, please, I must not cry. “As you wish, ser. And now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger’s bastard must find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can begin the tourney on the morrow.”  And may your horse stumble, Harry the Heir, so you fall on your stupid head in your first tilt. She showed the Waynwoods a stone face as they blurted out awkward apologies for their companion. When they were done she turned and fled.\n\nNear the keep, she ran headlong into Ser Lothor Brune and almost knocked him off his feet. “Harry the Heir?  Harry the Arse, I say. He’s just some upjumped squire.”\n\nAlayne was so grateful that she hugged him. “Thank you. Have you seen my father, ser?”\n\n“Down in the vaults, ” Ser Lothar said, “inspecting Lord Nestor’s granaries with Lord Grafton and Lord Belmore.”\n\nThe vaults were large and dark and filthy. Alayne lit a taper and clutched her skirt as she made the descent. Near the bottom, she heard Lord Grafton’s booming voice, and followed.”The merchants are clamoring to buy, and the lords are clamoring to sell,” the Gulltowner was saying when she found them.  Though not a tall man, Grafton was wide, with thick arms and shoulders.  His hair was a dirty blond mop.  “How am I to stop that, my lord?”\n\n“Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does not matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale. “\n\n“These prices, though,”  protested fat Lord Belmore,”  these prices are more than fair.”\n\n“You say more than fair, my lord.  I say less than we would wish.  Wait.  If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored.  Winter is coming.  Prices must go higher.”\n\n“Perhaps,”  said Belmore, doubtfully.\n\n“Bronze Yohn will not wait, ”  Grafton complained.  “He need not ship through Gulltown, he has his own ports.  Whilst we are hoarding our harvest, Royce and the other Lords Declarant will turn theirs into silver, you may be sure of that.”\n\n“Let us hope so,”  said Petyr.  “When their granaries are empty, they will need every scrap of that silver to buy sustenance from us.  And now if you will excuse me, my lord, it would seem my daughter has need of me.”\n\n“Lady Alayne,” Lord Grafton said. “You look bright-eyed this morning.”\n\n“You are kind to say so, my lord. Father, I am sorry to disturb you, but I thought you would want to know that the Waynwoods have arrived.”\n\n“And is Ser Harrold with them?”\n\nHorrible Ser Harrold.  “ He is.”\n\nLord Belmore laughed. “I never thought Royce would let him come. Is he blind, or merely stupid?”\n\n“He is honorable.  Sometimes it amounts to the same thing.  If he denied the lad the chance to prove himself, it could create a rift between them, so why not let him tilt?  The boy is nowise skilled enough to win a place amongst the Winged Knights.”\n\n“I suppose not,” said Belmore, grudgingly.  Lord Grafton kissed Alayne on the hand, and the two lords went off, leaving her alone with her lord father.\n\n“Come,” Petyr said, “walk with me.”  He took her by the arm and led her deeper into the vaults, past an empty dungeon.  “And how was your first meeting with Harry the Heir?”\n\n“He’s horrible.”\n\n“The world is full of horrors, sweet.  By now you ought to know that.  You’ve seen enough of them.”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “but why must he be so cruel?  He called me your bastard.  Right in the yard, in front of everyone.”\n\n“So far as he knows, that’s who you are.  This betrothal was never his idea, and Bronze Yohn has no doubt warned him against my wiles.  You are my daughter.  He does not trust you, and he believes that you’re beneath him.”\n\n“Well, I’m not.  He may think he’s some great knight, but Ser Lothor says he’s just some upjumped squire.”\n\nPetyr put his arm around her.  “So he is, but he is Robert’s heir as well.  Bringing Harry here was the first step in our plan, but now we need to keep him, and only you can do that.  He has a weakness for a pretty face, and whose face is prettier than yours?  Charm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.”\n\n“I don’t know how,”  she said miserably.\n\n“Oh, I think you do,” said Littlefinger, with one of those smiles that did not reach his eyes.  “You will be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight, as lovely as your lady mother at your age.  I cannot seat you on the dais, but you’ll have a place of honor above the salt and underneath a wall sconce.  The fire will be shining in your hair, so everyone will see how fair of face you are.  Keep a good long spoon on hand to beat the squires off, sweetling.  You will not want green boys underfoot when the knights come round to beg you for your favor.”\n\n“Who would ask to wear a bastard’s favor?”\n\n“Harry, if he has the wits the gods gave a goose… but do not give it to him.  Choose some other gallant, and favor him instead.  You do not want to seem too eager.”\n\n“No,” Alayne said.\n\n“Lady Waynwood will insist that Harry dance with you, I can promise you that much.  That will be your chance. Smile at the boy.  Touch him when you speak.  Tease him, to pique his pride.  If he seems to be responding, tell him that you are feeling faint, and ask him to take you outside for a breath of fresh air.  No knight could refuse such a request from a fair maiden.”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “but he thinks that I’m a bastard.”\n\n“A beautiful bastard, and the Lord Protector’s daughter.”  Petyr drew her close and kissed her on both cheeks.  “The night belongs to you, sweetling, Remember that, always.”\n\n“I’ll try, father,” she said.\n\nThe feast proved to be everything her father promised.\n\nSixty-four dishes were served, in honor of the sixty-four competitors who had come so far to contest for silver wings before their lord. From the rivers and the lakes came pike and trout and salmon, from the seas crabs and cod and herring. Ducks there were, and capons, peacocks in their plumage and swans in almond milk. Suckling pigs were served up crackling with apples in their mouths, and three huge aurochs were roasted whole above firepits in the castle yard, since they were too big to get through the kitchen doors. Loaves of hot bread filled the trestle tables in Lord Nestor’s hall, and massive wheels of cheese were brought up from the vaults.  The butter was fresh-churned, and there were leeks and carrots, roasted onions, beets, turnips, parsnips.  And best of all, Lord Nestor’s cooks prepared a splendid subtlety, a lemon cake in the shape of the Giant’s Lance, twelve feet tall and adorned with an Eyrie made of sugar.\n\nFor me, Alayne thought, as they wheeled it out.  Sweetrobin loved lemon cakes too, but only after she told him that they were her favorites.  The cake had required every lemon in the Vale, but Petyr had promised that he would send to Dorne for more.\n\nThere were gifts as well, splendid gifts.  Each of the competitors received a cloak of cloth-of-silver and a lapis brooch in the shape of a pair of falcon’s wings.  Fine steel daggers were given to the brothers, fathers, and friends who had come to watch them tilt.  For their mothers, sisters, and ladies fair there were bolts of silk and Myrish lace.\n\n“Lord Nestor has an open hand,” Alayne heard Ser Edmund Breakstone say.  “An open hand and a little finger,” Lady Waynwood replied, with a nod toward Petyr Baelish.   Breakstone was not slow to take her meaning.  The true source of this largesse was not Lord Nestor, but the Lord Protector.\n\nWhen the last course had been served and cleared, the tables were lifted from their trestles to clear the floor for dancing, and musicians were brought in.\n\n“Are there no singers?” asked Ben Coldwater.\n\n“The little lord cannot abide them,” Ser Lymond Lynderly replied.  “Not since Marillion.”\n\n“Ah… that was the man who murdered Lady Lysa, yes?”\n\nAlayne spoke up. “His singing pleased her greatly, and she showed him too much favor, perhaps.  When she wed my father he went mad and pushed her out the Moon Door.  Lord Robert has hated singing ever since.  He is still fond of music, though.”\n\n“As am I,” Coldwater said.  Rising, he offered Alayne his hand.  “Would you honor me with this dance, my lady?”\n\n“You’re very kind,” she said, as he led her to the floor.\n\nHe was her first partner of the evening, but far from the last.  Just as Petyr had promised, the young knights flocked around her, vying for her favor.  After Ben came Andrew Tollett, handsome Ser Byron, red-nosed Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse.  Then Ser Albar Royce, Myranda’s stout dull brother and Lord Nestor’s heir.  She danced with all three Sunderlands, none of whom had webs between their fingers, though she could not vouch for their toes.  Uther Shett appeared to pay her slimy compliments as he trod upon her feet, but Ser Targon the Halfwild proved to be the soul of courtesy.  After that Ser Roland Waynwood swept her up and made her laugh with mocking comments about half the other knights in the hall.  His uncle Wallace took a turn as well and tried to do the same, but the words would not come.  Alayne finally took pity on him and began to chatter happily, to spare him the embarrassment.  When the dance was done she excused herself, and went back to her place to have a drink of wine.\n\nAnd there he stood, Harry the Heir himself; tall, handsome, scowling.  “Lady Alayne. May I partner you in this dance?”\n\nShe considered for a moment. “No. I don’t think so.”\n\nColor rose to his cheeks.  “I was unforgiveably rude to you in the yard.  You must forgive me.”\n\n“Must?” She tossed her hair, took a sip of wine, made him wait.  “How can you forgive someone who is unforgiveably rude?  Will you explain that to me, ser?”\n\nSer Harrold looked confused. “Please.  One dance.”\n\nCharm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.  “If you insist.”\n\nHe nodded, offered his arm, led her out onto the floor.  As they waited for the music to resume, Alayne glanced at the dais, where Lord Robert sat staring at them.  Please, she prayed, don’t let him start to twitch and shake.  Not here.  Not now.  Maester Coleman would have made certain that he drank a strong dose of sweetmilk before the feast, but even so.\n\nThen the musicians took up a tune, and she was dancing.\n\nSay something, she urged herself.  You will never make Ser Harry love you if you don’t have the courage to talk him.  Should she tell him what a good dancer he was?  No, he’s probably heard that a dozen times tonight.  Besides, Petyr said that I should not seem eager.  Instead she said, “I have heard that you are about to be a father.”  It was not something most girls would say to their almost-betrothed, but she wanted to see if Ser Harrold would lie.\n\n“For the second time. My daughter Alys is two years old.”\n\nYour bastard daughter Alys, Alayne thought, but what she said was, “That one had a different mother, though.”\n\n“Yes. Cissy was a pretty thing when I tumbled her, but childbirth left her as fat as a cow, so Lady Anya arranged for her to marry one of her men-at-arms.  It is different with Saffron.”\n\n“Saffron?”  Alayne tried not to laugh.  “Truly?”\n\nSer Harrold had the grace to blush.  “Her father says she is more precious to him than gold.  He’s rich, the richest man in Gulltown.  A fortune in spices.”\n\n“What will you name the babe?” she asked.  “Cinnamon if she’s a girl?  Cloves if he’s a boy?”\n\nThat almost made him stumble.  “My lady japes.”\n\n“Oh, no.”  Petyr will howl when I tell him what I said.\n\n“Saffron is very beautiful, I’ll have you know.  Tall and slim, with big brown eyes and hair like honey.”\n\nAlayne raised her head.  “More beautiful than me?”\n\nSer Harrold studied her face. “You are comely enough, I grant you.  When Lady Anya first told me of this match, I was afraid that you might look like your father.”\n\n“Little pointy beard and all?”  Alayne laughed.\n\n“I never meant… “\n\n“I hope you joust better than you talk.”\n\nFor a moment he looked shocked.  But as the song was ending, he burst into a laugh.  “No one told me you were clever.”\n\nHe has good teeth, she thought, straight and white.  And when he smiles, he has the nicest dimples.  She ran one finger down his cheek.  “Should we ever wed, you’ll have to send Saffron back to her father.  I’ll be all the spice you’ll want.”\n\nHe grinned.  “I will hold you to that promise, my lady.  Until that day, may I wear your favor in the tourney?”\n\n“You may not.  It is promised to… another.”  She was not sure who as yet, but she knew she would find someone.\n","slug":"ALAYNE","published":1,"updated":"2017-04-15T14:05:37.000Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck9met64s000jsltpe6f23ov5","content":"<h2 id=\"ALAYNE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\"><a href=\"#ALAYNE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ALAYNE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\"></a>ALAYNE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER</h2><p>She was reading her little lord a tale of the Winged Knight when Mya Stone came knocking on the door of his bedchamber, clad in boots and riding leathers and smelling strongly of the stable. Mya had straw in her hair and a scowl on her face. That scowl comes of having Mychel Redfort near, Alayne knew.</p>\n<p>“Your lordship,” Mya informed Lord Robert, “Lady Waynwood’s banners have been seen an hour down the road. She will be here soon, with your cousin Harry. Will you want to greet them?”</p>\n<p>Why did she have to mention Harry? Alayne thought. We will never get Sweetrobin out of bed now. The boy slapped a pillow. “Send them away. I never asked them here.”<br><a id=\"more\"></a><br>Mya looked nonplussed. No one in the Vale was better at handling a mule, but lordlings were another matter. “They were invited,” she said uncertainly, “for the tourney. I don’t… “</p>\n<p>Alayne closed her book.  “Thank you, Mya. Let me talk with Lord Robert, if you would.”</p>\n<p>Relief plain on her face, Mya fled without another word.</p>\n<p>“I hate that Harry,” Sweetrobin said when she was gone. “He calls me cousin, but he’s just waiting for me to die so he can take the Eyrie. He thinks I don’t know, but I do.”</p>\n<p>“Your lordship should not believe such nonsense,” Alayne said. “I’m sure Ser Harrold loves you well.” And if the gods are good, he will love me too. Her tummy gave a little flutter.</p>\n<p>“He doesn’t,” Lord Robert insisted. “He wants my father’s castle, that’s all, so he pretends.” The boy clutched the blanket to his pimply chest. “I don’t want you to marry him, Alayne. I am the Lord of the Eyrie, and I forbid it.” He sounded as if he were about to cry. “You should marry me instead. We could sleep in the same bed every night, and you could read me stories.”</p>\n<p>No man can wed me so long as my dwarf husband still lives somewhere in this world. Queen Cersei had collected the head of a dozen dwarfs, Petyr claimed, but none were Tyrion’s. “Sweetrobin, you must not say such things. You are the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, and you must wed a highborn lady and father a son to sit in the High Hall of House Arryn after you are gone.”</p>\n<p>Robert wiped his nose. “But I want — “</p>\n<p>She put a finger to his lips. “I know what you want, but it cannot be. I am no fit wife for you. I am bastard born.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t care. I love you best of anyone. “</p>\n<p>You are such a little fool.  “Your lords bannermen will care. Some call my father upjumped and ambitious. If you were to take me to wife, they would say that he made you do it, that it was no will of yours. The Lords Declarant might take arms against him once again, and he and I should both be put to death.”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t let them hurt you!” Lord Robert said. “If they try I will make them all fly.” His hand began to tremble.</p>\n<p>Alayne stroked his fingers. “There, my Sweetrobin, be still now.” When the shaking passed, she said, “You must have a proper wife, a trueborn maid of noble birth.”</p>\n<p>“No. I want to marry you, Alayne.”</p>\n<p>Once your lady mother intended that very thing, but I was trueborn then, and noble. “My lord is kind to say so.” Alayne smoothed his hair. Lady Lysa had never let the servants touch it, and after she had died Robert had suffered terrible shaking fits whenever anyone came near him with a blade, so it had been allowed to grow until it tumbled over his round shoulders and halfway down his flabby white chest. He does have pretty hair.  If the gods are good and he lives long enough to wed, his wife will admire his hair, surely.  That much she will love about him. “Any child of ours would be baseborn. Only a trueborn child of House Arryn can displace Ser Harrold as your heir. My father will find a proper wife for you, some highborn girl much prettier than me. You’ll hunt and hawk together, and she’ll give you her favor to wear in tournaments. Before long, you will have forgotten me entirely.”</p>\n<p>“I won’t!”</p>\n<p>“You will. You must.” Her voice was firm, but gentle.</p>\n<p>“The Lord of the Eyrie can do as he likes. Can’t I still love you, even if I have to marry her? Ser Harrold has a common woman. Benjicot says she’s carrying his bastard.”</p>\n<p>Benjicot should learn to keep his fool’s mouth shut. “Is that what you would have from me? A bastard?” She pulled her fingers from his grasp. “Would you dishonor me that way?”</p>\n<p>The boy looked stricken. “No. I never meant — “</p>\n<p>Alayne stood. “If it please my lord, I must go and find my father. Someone needs to greet Lady Waynwood.” Before her little lord could find the words to protest, she gave him a quick curtsy and fled the bedchamber, sweeping down the hall and across a covered bridge to the Lord Protector’s apartments.</p>\n<p>When she had left Petyr Baelish that morning he had been breaking his fast with old Oswell who had arrived last night from Gulltown on a lathered horse. She hoped they might still be talking, but Petyr’s solar proved empty. Someone had left a window open and a stack of papers had blown onto the floor. The sun was slanting through the thick yellow windows, and dust motes danced in the light like tiny golden insects. Though snow had blanketed the heights of the Giant’s Lance above, below the mountain the autumn lingered and winter wheat was ripening in the fields.  Outside the window she could hear the laughter of the washerwomen at the well, the din of steel on steel from the ward where the knights were at their drills. Good sounds.</p>\n<p>Alayne loved it here. She felt alive again, for the first since her father… since Lord Eddard Stark had died.</p>\n<p>She closed the window, gathered up the fallen papers, and stacked them on the table. One was a list of the competitors. Four-and-sixty knights had been invited to vie for places amongst Lord Robert Arryn’s  new Brotherhood of Winged Knights, and four­ and-sixty knights had come to tilt for the right to wear falcon’s wings upon their warhelms and guard their lord.</p>\n<p>The competitors came from all over the Vale, from the mountain valleys and the coast, from Gulltown and the Bloody Gate, even the Three Sisters. Though a few were promised, only three were wed; the eight victors would be expected to spend the next three years at Lord Robert’s side, as his own personal guard (Alayne had suggested seven, like the Kingsguard, but Sweetrobin had insisted that he must have more knights than King Tommen), so older men with wives and children had not been invited.</p>\n<p>And they came, Alayne thought proudly. They all came.</p>\n<p>It had fallen out just as Petyr said it would, the day the ravens flew. “They’re young, eager, hungry for adventure and renown. Lysa would not let them go to war. This is the next best thing. A chance to serve their lord and prove their prowess. They will come. Even Harry the Heir.” He had smoothed her hair and kissed her forehead. “What a clever daughter you are.”</p>\n<p>It was clever. The tourney, the prizes, the winged knights, it had all been her own notion. Lord Robert’s mother had filled him full of fears, but he always took courage from the tales she read him of Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight of legend, founder of his line. Why not surround him with Winged Knights?  She had thought one night, after Sweetrobin had finally drifted off to sleep. His own Kingsguard, to keep him safe and make him brave. And no sooner did she tell Petyr her idea than he went out and made it happen. He will want to be there to greet Ser Harrold. Where could he have gone?</p>\n<p>Alayne swept down the tower stairs to enter the pillared gallery at the back of the Great Hall. Below her, serving men were setting up trestle tables for the evening feast, while their wives and daughters swept up the old rushes and scattered fresh ones. Lord Nestor was showing Lady Waxley his prize tapestries, with their scenes of hunt and chase. The same panels had once hung in the Red Keep of King’s Landing, when Robert sat the Iron Throne. Joffrey had them taken down and they had languished in some cellar until Petyr Baelish arranged for them to be brought to the Vale as a gift for Nestor Royce. Not only were the hangings beautiful, but the High Steward delighted in telling anyone who’d listen that they had once belonged to a king.</p>\n<p>Petyr was not in the Great Hall. Alayne crossed the gallery and descended the stair built into the thick west wall, to come out in the inner ward, where the jousting would be held. Viewing stands had raised for all those who had come to watch, with four long tilting barriers in between. Lord Nestor’s men were painting the barriers with whitewash, draping the stands with bright banners, and hanging shields on the gate the competitors would pass through when they made their entrance.</p>\n<p>At the north end of the yard, three quintains had been set up, and some of the competitors were riding at them. Alayne knew them by their shields; the bells of Belmore, green vipers for the Lynderlys, the red sledge of Breakstone, House Tollett’s black and grey pily. Ser Mychel Redfort set one quintain spinning with a perfectly placed blow. He was one of those favored to win wings.</p>\n<p>Petyr was not at the quintains, nor anywhere in the yard, but as she turned to go a woman’s voice called out. “Alayne!” cried Myranda Royce, from a carved stone bench beneath a beech tree, where she was seated between two men. She looked in need of rescue. Smiling, Alayne walked toward her friend.</p>\n<p>Myranda was wearing a grey woolen dress, a green hooded cloak, and a rather desperate look. On either side of her sat a knight. The one on her right had a grizzled beard, a bald head, and a belly that spilled over his swordbelt where his lap should have been. The one on her left was no more than eighteen, and skinny as a spear. His ginger-colored whiskers only partially served to disguise the angry red pimples that dotted his face.</p>\n<p>The bald knight wore a dark blue surcoat emblazoned with a huge pair of pink lips. The pimply-gingerlad countered with nine white seagulls on a field of brown, which marked him for a Shett of Gulltown. He was staring so intently at Myranda’s breasts that he hardly noticed Alayne until Myranda rose to hug her. “Thank you, thank you, thank you ” Randa whispered in her ear, before she turned to say, “Sers, may I present you the Lady Alayne Stone?”</p>\n<p>“The Lord Protector’s daughter,” the bald knight announced, all hearty gallantry. He rose ponderously. “And full as lovely as the tales told of her, I see.”</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, the pimply knight hopped up and said,  “Ser Ossifer speaks truly, you are the most beautiful maid in all the Seven Kingdoms.” It might have been a sweeter courtesy had he not addressed it to her chest.</p>\n<p>“And have you seen all those maids yourself, ser?” Alayne asked him. “You are young to be so widely travelled.”</p>\n<p>He blushed, which only made his pimples look angrier.  “No, my lady.   I am from Gulltown.”</p>\n<p>And I am not, though Alayne was born there. She would need to be careful around this one. “I remember Gulltown fondly,” she told him, with a smile as vague as it was pleasant. To Myranda she said, “Do you know where my father’s gotten to, perchance?”</p>\n<p>“Let me take you to him, my lady.”</p>\n<p>“I do hope you will forgive me for depriving you of Lady Myranda’s company,” Alayne told the knights. She did not wait for a reply, but took the older girl arm-in-arm and drew her away from the bench. Only when they were out of earshot did she whisper,  “Do you really know where my father is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not. Walk faster, my new suitors may be following.” Myranda made a face. “Ossifer Lipps is the dullest knight in the Vale, but Uther Shett aspires to his laurels. I am praying they fight a duel for my hand, and kill each other.”</p>\n<p>Alayne giggled. “Surely Lord Nestor would not seriously entertain a suit from such men.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, he might. My lord father is annoyed with me for killing my last husband and putting him to all this trouble.”</p>\n<p>“It was not your fault he died.”</p>\n<p>“There was no one else in the bed that I recall.”</p>\n<p>Alayne could not help but shutter. Myranda’s husband had died when he was making love with her. “Those Sistermen who came in yesterday were gallant,” she said, to change the subject. “If you don’t like Ser Ossifer or Ser Uther, marry one of them instead. I thought the youngest one was very handsome.”</p>\n<p>“The one in the sealskin cloak?” Randa said, incredulous.</p>\n<p>“One of his brothers, then.”</p>\n<p>Myranda rolled her eyes. “They’re from the Sisters. Did you ever know a Sisterman who could joust? They clean their swords with codfish oil and wash in tubs of cold seawater.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Alayne said, “at least they’re clean.”</p>\n<p>“Some of them have webs between their toes. I’d sooner marry Lord Petyr. Then I’d be your mother. How little is his finger, I ask you?”</p>\n<p>Alayne did not dignify that question with an answer. “Lady Waynwood will be here soon, with her sons.”</p>\n<p>“Is that a promise or a threat?” Myranda said. “The first Lady Waynwood must have been a mare, I think. How else to explain why all the Waynwood men are horse-faced? If I were ever to wed a Waynwood, he would have to swear a vow to don his helm whenever he wished to fuck me, and keep the visor closed.” She gave Alayne a pinch on the arm. “My Harry will be with them, though. I notice that you left him out. I shall never forgive you for stealing him away from me. He’s the boy I want to marry.”</p>\n<p>“The betrothal was my father’s doing,”  Alayne protested, as she had a hundred times before.  She is only teasing, she told herself… but behind the japes, she could hear the hurt.</p>\n<p>Myranda stopped to gaze across the yard at the knights at their practice. “Now there’s the very sort of husband I need.”</p>\n<p>A few feet away, two knights were fighting with blunted practice swords. Their blades crashed together twice, then slipped past each other only to be blocked by upraised shields, but the bigger man gave ground at the impact. Alayne could not see the front of his shield from where she stood, but his attacker bore three ravens in flight, each clutching a red heart in its claws. Three hearts and three ravens.</p>\n<p>She knew right then how the fight would end.</p>\n<p>A few moments later and the big man sprawled dazed in the dust with his helm askew. When his squire undid the fastenings to bare his head, there was blood trickling down his scalp. If the swords had not been blunted, there would be brains as well. That last head blow had been so hard Alayne had winced in sympathy when it fell. Myranda Royce considered the victor thoughtfully.  “Do you think if I asked nicely Ser Lyn would kill my suitors for me?”</p>\n<p>“He might, for a plump bag of gold.” Ser Lyn Corbray was forever desperately short of coin, all the Vale knew that.</p>\n<p>“Alas, all I have is a plump pair of teats. Though with Ser Lyn, a plump sausage under my skirts would serve me better.”</p>\n<p>Alayne’s giggle drew Corbray’s attention. He handed his shield to his loutish squire, removed his helm and quilted coif.  “Ladies.” His long brown hair was plastered to his brow by sweat.</p>\n<p>“Well struck, Ser Lyn,” Alayne called out. “Though I fear you’ve knocked poor Ser Owen insensible.”</p>\n<p>Corbray glanced back to where his foe was being helped from the yard by his squire. “He had no sense to start with, or he should not have tried me.”</p>\n<p>There is truth in that, Alayne thought, but some demon of mischief was in her that morning, so she gave Ser Lyn a thrust of her own. Smiling sweetly, she said, “My lord father tells me your brother’s new wife is with child.”</p>\n<p>Corbray gave her a dark look. “Lyonel sends his regrets. He remains at Heart’s Home with his peddler’s daughter, watching her belly swell as if he were the first man who ever got a wench pregnant.”</p>\n<p>Oh, that’s an open wound, thought Alayne. Lyonel Corbray’s first wife had given him nothing but a frail, sickly babe who died in infancy, and during all those years Ser Lyn had remained his brother’s heir. When the poor woman finally died, however, Petyr Baelish had stepped in and brokered a new marriage for Lord Corbray. The second Lady Corbray was sixteen, the daughter of a wealthy Gulltown merchant, but she had come with an immense dowry, and men said she was a tall, strapping, healthy girl, with big breasts and good, wide hips. And fertile too, it seems.</p>\n<p>“We are all praying that the Mother grants Lady Corbray an easy labor and a healthy child,” said Myranda.</p>\n<p>Alayne could not help herself. She smiled and said, “My father is always pleased to be of service to one of Lord Robert’s leal bannermen. I’m sure he would be most delighted to help broker a marriage for you as well, Ser Lyn.”</p>\n<p>“How kind of him.” Corbray’s lips drew back in something that might have been meant as a smile, though it gave Alayne a chill. “But what need have I for heirs when I am landless and like to remain so, thanks to our Lord Protector?  No.  Tell your lord father I need none of his brood mares.”</p>\n<p>The venom in his voice was so thick that for a moment she almost forgot that Lyn Corbray was actually her father’s catspaw, bought and paid for. Or was he?  Perhaps, instead of being Petyr’s man pretending to be Petyr’s foe, he was actually his foe pretending to be his man pretending to be his foe.</p>\n<p>Just thinking about it was enough to make her head spin. Alayne turned abruptly from the yard… and bumped into a short, sharp-faced man with a brush of orange hair who had come up behind her.  His hand shot out and caught her arm before she could fall.   “My lady.  My pardons if I took you unawares.”</p>\n<p>“The fault was mine. I did not see you standing there.”</p>\n<p>“We mice are quiet creatures.” Ser Shadrich was so short that he might have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much older man. She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of his mouth, old battles in the scar beneath his ear, and a hardness behind the eyes that no boy would ever have. This was a man grown. Even Randa overtopped him, though.</p>\n<p>“Will you be seeking wings?” the Royce girl said.</p>\n<p>“A mouse with wings would be a silly sight.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps you will try the melee instead?” Alayne suggested.  The melee was an afterthought, a sop for all the brothers, uncles, fathers, and friends who had accompanied the competitors to the Gates of the Moon to see them win their silver wings, but there would be prizes for the champions, and a chance to win ransoms.</p>\n<p>“A good melee is all a hedge knight can hope for, unless he stumbles on a bag of dragons. And that’s not likely, is it?”</p>\n<p>“I suppose not. But now you must excuse us, ser, we need to find my lord father. “</p>\n<p>Horns sounded from atop the wall.  “Too late,” Myranda said. “They’re here.  We shall need to do the honors by ourselves.”  She grinned.   “Last one to the gate must marry Uther Shett.”</p>\n<p>They made a race of it, dashing headlong across the yard and past the stables, skirts flapping, whilst knights and serving men alike looked on, and pigs and chickens scattered before them. It was most unladylike, but Alayne sound found herself laughing. For just a little while, as she ran, she forget who she was, and where, and found herself remembering bright cold days at Winterfell, when she would race through Winterfell with her friend Jeyne Poole, with Arya running after them trying to keep up.</p>\n<p>By the time they arrived at the gatehouse, both of them were red-faced and panting. Myranda had lost her cloak somewhere along the way. They were just in time. The portcullis had been raised, and a column of riders twenty strong were passing underneath. At their head rode Anya Waynwood, Lady of Ironoaks, stern and slim, her grey-brown hair bound up in a scarf. Her riding cloak was heavy green wool trimmed with brown fur, and clasped at the throat by a niello brooch in the shape of the broken wheel of her House.</p>\n<p>Myranda Royce stepped forward and sketched a curtsy. “Lady Anya. Welcome to the Gates of the Moon.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Myranda. Lady Alayne.” Anya Waynwood inclined her head to each of them in turn. “It is good of you to greet us. Allow me to present my grandson, Ser Roland Waynwood.”  She nodded at the knight who had spoken.  “And this is my youngest son, Ser Wallace Waynwood.  And of course my ward, Ser Harrold Hardyng.”</p>\n<p>Harry the Heir, Alayne thought. My husband-to-be, if he will have me.  A sudden terror filled her.  She wondered if her face was red. Don’t stare at him, she reminded herself, don’t stare, don’t gape, don’t gawk.  Look away. Her hair must be a frightful mess after all that running.  It took all her will to stop herself from trying to tuck the loose strands back into place. Never mind your stupid hair.  Your hair doesn’t matter.  It’s him that matters.  Him, and the Waynwoods.</p>\n<p>Ser Roland was the oldest of the three, though no more than five-and-twenty. He was taller and more muscular than Ser Wallace, but both were long-faced and lantern-jawed, with stringy brown hair and pinched noses.  Horsefaced and homely, Alayne thought.</p>\n<p>Harry, though…</p>\n<p>My Harry.  My lord, my lover, my betrothed.</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold Hardyng looked every inch a lord-in-waiting; clean-limbed and handsome, straight as a lance, hard with muscle. Men old enough to have known Jon Arryn in his youth said Ser Harrold had his look, she knew. He had a mop of sandy blond hair, pale blue eyes, an aquiline nose. Joffrey was comely too, though, she reminded herself.   A comely monster, that’s what he was.  Little Lord Tyrion was kinder, twisted though he was.</p>\n<p>Harry was staring at her. He knows who I am, she realized, and he does not seem pleased to see me. It was only then that she took note of his heraldry. Though his surcoat and horse trappings were patterned in the red-and-white diamonds of House Hardyng, his shield was quartered. The arms of Hardyng and Waynwood were displayed in the first and third quarters, respectively, but in the second and fourth quarters he bore the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky blue and cream. Sweetrobin will not like that.</p>\n<p>Ser Wallace said, “Are we the l-l-last?”</p>\n<p>“You are, sers,” replied Myranda Royce, taking absolutely no notice of his stammer.</p>\n<p>“Wh-wh-when will the t-t-tilts commence?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, soon, I pray,” said Randa. “Some of the competitors have been here for almost a moon’s turn, partaking of my father’s meat and mead. All good fellows, and very brave… but they do eat rather a lot.”</p>\n<p>The Waynwoods laughed, and even Harry the Heir cracked a thin smile. “It was snowing in the passes, else we would have been here sooner,” said Lady Anya.</p>\n<p>“Had we known such beauty awaited us at the Gates, we would have flown,” Ser Roland said.  Though his words were addressed to Myranda Royce, he smiled at Alayne as he said them.</p>\n<p>“To fly you would need wings,” Randa replied, “and there are some knights here who might have a thing to say concerning that.”</p>\n<p>“I look forward to a spirited discussion.” Ser Roland swung down from his horse, turned to Alayne, and smiled.  “I had heard that Lord Littlefinger’s daughter was fair of face and full of grace, but no one ever told me that she was a thief.”</p>\n<p>“You wrong me, ser. I am no thief!”</p>\n<p>Ser Roland placed his hand over his heart. “Then how do you explain this hole in my chest, from where you stole my heart?”</p>\n<p>“He is only t-teasing you, my lady,” stammered Ser Wallace. “My n-n-nephew never had a h-h-heart.”</p>\n<p>“The Waynwood wheel has a broken spoke, and we have my nuncle here.” Ser Roland gave Wallace a whap behind the ear.  “Squires should be quiet when knights are speaking.”</p>\n<p>Ser Wallace reddened.  “I am no more a s-squire, my lady.  My n-nephew knows full well that I was k-k-kni-k-k-kni –“</p>\n<p>“Dubbed?” Alayne suggested gently.</p>\n<p>“Dubbed,” said Wallace Waynwood, gratefully.</p>\n<p>Robb would be his age, if he were still alive, she could not help but think, but Robb died a king, and this is just a boy.</p>\n<p>“My lord father has assigned you rooms in the East Tower,” Lady Myranda was telling Lady Waynwood, “but I fear your knights will need to share a bed. The Gates of the Moon were never meant to house so many noble visitors.”</p>\n<p>“You are in the Falcon Tower, Ser Harrold,” Alayne put in. Far away from Sweetrobin. That was intentional, she knew. Petyr Baelish did not leave such things to chance. “If it please you, I will show you to your chambers myself.” This time her eyes met Harry’s.  She smiled just for him, and said a silent prayer to the Maiden. Please, he doesn’t need to love me, just make him like me, just a little, that would be enough for now.</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold looked down at her coldly. “Why should it please me to be escorted anywhere by Littlefinger’s bastard?”</p>\n<p>All three Waynwoods looked at him askance. “You are a guest here, Harry,” Lady Anya reminded him, in a frosty voice. “See that you remember that.”</p>\n<p>A lady’s armor is her courtesy. Alayne could feel the blood rushing to her face. No tears, she prayed. Please, please, I must not cry. “As you wish, ser. And now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger’s bastard must find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can begin the tourney on the morrow.”  And may your horse stumble, Harry the Heir, so you fall on your stupid head in your first tilt. She showed the Waynwoods a stone face as they blurted out awkward apologies for their companion. When they were done she turned and fled.</p>\n<p>Near the keep, she ran headlong into Ser Lothor Brune and almost knocked him off his feet. “Harry the Heir?  Harry the Arse, I say. He’s just some upjumped squire.”</p>\n<p>Alayne was so grateful that she hugged him. “Thank you. Have you seen my father, ser?”</p>\n<p>“Down in the vaults, ” Ser Lothar said, “inspecting Lord Nestor’s granaries with Lord Grafton and Lord Belmore.”</p>\n<p>The vaults were large and dark and filthy. Alayne lit a taper and clutched her skirt as she made the descent. Near the bottom, she heard Lord Grafton’s booming voice, and followed.”The merchants are clamoring to buy, and the lords are clamoring to sell,” the Gulltowner was saying when she found them.  Though not a tall man, Grafton was wide, with thick arms and shoulders.  His hair was a dirty blond mop.  “How am I to stop that, my lord?”</p>\n<p>“Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does not matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale. “</p>\n<p>“These prices, though,”  protested fat Lord Belmore,”  these prices are more than fair.”</p>\n<p>“You say more than fair, my lord.  I say less than we would wish.  Wait.  If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored.  Winter is coming.  Prices must go higher.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps,”  said Belmore, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>“Bronze Yohn will not wait, ”  Grafton complained.  “He need not ship through Gulltown, he has his own ports.  Whilst we are hoarding our harvest, Royce and the other Lords Declarant will turn theirs into silver, you may be sure of that.”</p>\n<p>“Let us hope so,”  said Petyr.  “When their granaries are empty, they will need every scrap of that silver to buy sustenance from us.  And now if you will excuse me, my lord, it would seem my daughter has need of me.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Alayne,” Lord Grafton said. “You look bright-eyed this morning.”</p>\n<p>“You are kind to say so, my lord. Father, I am sorry to disturb you, but I thought you would want to know that the Waynwoods have arrived.”</p>\n<p>“And is Ser Harrold with them?”</p>\n<p>Horrible Ser Harrold.  “ He is.”</p>\n<p>Lord Belmore laughed. “I never thought Royce would let him come. Is he blind, or merely stupid?”</p>\n<p>“He is honorable.  Sometimes it amounts to the same thing.  If he denied the lad the chance to prove himself, it could create a rift between them, so why not let him tilt?  The boy is nowise skilled enough to win a place amongst the Winged Knights.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose not,” said Belmore, grudgingly.  Lord Grafton kissed Alayne on the hand, and the two lords went off, leaving her alone with her lord father.</p>\n<p>“Come,” Petyr said, “walk with me.”  He took her by the arm and led her deeper into the vaults, past an empty dungeon.  “And how was your first meeting with Harry the Heir?”</p>\n<p>“He’s horrible.”</p>\n<p>“The world is full of horrors, sweet.  By now you ought to know that.  You’ve seen enough of them.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said, “but why must he be so cruel?  He called me your bastard.  Right in the yard, in front of everyone.”</p>\n<p>“So far as he knows, that’s who you are.  This betrothal was never his idea, and Bronze Yohn has no doubt warned him against my wiles.  You are my daughter.  He does not trust you, and he believes that you’re beneath him.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not.  He may think he’s some great knight, but Ser Lothor says he’s just some upjumped squire.”</p>\n<p>Petyr put his arm around her.  “So he is, but he is Robert’s heir as well.  Bringing Harry here was the first step in our plan, but now we need to keep him, and only you can do that.  He has a weakness for a pretty face, and whose face is prettier than yours?  Charm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how,”  she said miserably.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I think you do,” said Littlefinger, with one of those smiles that did not reach his eyes.  “You will be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight, as lovely as your lady mother at your age.  I cannot seat you on the dais, but you’ll have a place of honor above the salt and underneath a wall sconce.  The fire will be shining in your hair, so everyone will see how fair of face you are.  Keep a good long spoon on hand to beat the squires off, sweetling.  You will not want green boys underfoot when the knights come round to beg you for your favor.”</p>\n<p>“Who would ask to wear a bastard’s favor?”</p>\n<p>“Harry, if he has the wits the gods gave a goose… but do not give it to him.  Choose some other gallant, and favor him instead.  You do not want to seem too eager.”</p>\n<p>“No,” Alayne said.</p>\n<p>“Lady Waynwood will insist that Harry dance with you, I can promise you that much.  That will be your chance. Smile at the boy.  Touch him when you speak.  Tease him, to pique his pride.  If he seems to be responding, tell him that you are feeling faint, and ask him to take you outside for a breath of fresh air.  No knight could refuse such a request from a fair maiden.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said, “but he thinks that I’m a bastard.”</p>\n<p>“A beautiful bastard, and the Lord Protector’s daughter.”  Petyr drew her close and kissed her on both cheeks.  “The night belongs to you, sweetling, Remember that, always.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll try, father,” she said.</p>\n<p>The feast proved to be everything her father promised.</p>\n<p>Sixty-four dishes were served, in honor of the sixty-four competitors who had come so far to contest for silver wings before their lord. From the rivers and the lakes came pike and trout and salmon, from the seas crabs and cod and herring. Ducks there were, and capons, peacocks in their plumage and swans in almond milk. Suckling pigs were served up crackling with apples in their mouths, and three huge aurochs were roasted whole above firepits in the castle yard, since they were too big to get through the kitchen doors. Loaves of hot bread filled the trestle tables in Lord Nestor’s hall, and massive wheels of cheese were brought up from the vaults.  The butter was fresh-churned, and there were leeks and carrots, roasted onions, beets, turnips, parsnips.  And best of all, Lord Nestor’s cooks prepared a splendid subtlety, a lemon cake in the shape of the Giant’s Lance, twelve feet tall and adorned with an Eyrie made of sugar.</p>\n<p>For me, Alayne thought, as they wheeled it out.  Sweetrobin loved lemon cakes too, but only after she told him that they were her favorites.  The cake had required every lemon in the Vale, but Petyr had promised that he would send to Dorne for more.</p>\n<p>There were gifts as well, splendid gifts.  Each of the competitors received a cloak of cloth-of-silver and a lapis brooch in the shape of a pair of falcon’s wings.  Fine steel daggers were given to the brothers, fathers, and friends who had come to watch them tilt.  For their mothers, sisters, and ladies fair there were bolts of silk and Myrish lace.</p>\n<p>“Lord Nestor has an open hand,” Alayne heard Ser Edmund Breakstone say.  “An open hand and a little finger,” Lady Waynwood replied, with a nod toward Petyr Baelish.   Breakstone was not slow to take her meaning.  The true source of this largesse was not Lord Nestor, but the Lord Protector.</p>\n<p>When the last course had been served and cleared, the tables were lifted from their trestles to clear the floor for dancing, and musicians were brought in.</p>\n<p>“Are there no singers?” asked Ben Coldwater.</p>\n<p>“The little lord cannot abide them,” Ser Lymond Lynderly replied.  “Not since Marillion.”</p>\n<p>“Ah… that was the man who murdered Lady Lysa, yes?”</p>\n<p>Alayne spoke up. “His singing pleased her greatly, and she showed him too much favor, perhaps.  When she wed my father he went mad and pushed her out the Moon Door.  Lord Robert has hated singing ever since.  He is still fond of music, though.”</p>\n<p>“As am I,” Coldwater said.  Rising, he offered Alayne his hand.  “Would you honor me with this dance, my lady?”</p>\n<p>“You’re very kind,” she said, as he led her to the floor.</p>\n<p>He was her first partner of the evening, but far from the last.  Just as Petyr had promised, the young knights flocked around her, vying for her favor.  After Ben came Andrew Tollett, handsome Ser Byron, red-nosed Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse.  Then Ser Albar Royce, Myranda’s stout dull brother and Lord Nestor’s heir.  She danced with all three Sunderlands, none of whom had webs between their fingers, though she could not vouch for their toes.  Uther Shett appeared to pay her slimy compliments as he trod upon her feet, but Ser Targon the Halfwild proved to be the soul of courtesy.  After that Ser Roland Waynwood swept her up and made her laugh with mocking comments about half the other knights in the hall.  His uncle Wallace took a turn as well and tried to do the same, but the words would not come.  Alayne finally took pity on him and began to chatter happily, to spare him the embarrassment.  When the dance was done she excused herself, and went back to her place to have a drink of wine.</p>\n<p>And there he stood, Harry the Heir himself; tall, handsome, scowling.  “Lady Alayne. May I partner you in this dance?”</p>\n<p>She considered for a moment. “No. I don’t think so.”</p>\n<p>Color rose to his cheeks.  “I was unforgiveably rude to you in the yard.  You must forgive me.”</p>\n<p>“Must?” She tossed her hair, took a sip of wine, made him wait.  “How can you forgive someone who is unforgiveably rude?  Will you explain that to me, ser?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold looked confused. “Please.  One dance.”</p>\n<p>Charm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.  “If you insist.”</p>\n<p>He nodded, offered his arm, led her out onto the floor.  As they waited for the music to resume, Alayne glanced at the dais, where Lord Robert sat staring at them.  Please, she prayed, don’t let him start to twitch and shake.  Not here.  Not now.  Maester Coleman would have made certain that he drank a strong dose of sweetmilk before the feast, but even so.</p>\n<p>Then the musicians took up a tune, and she was dancing.</p>\n<p>Say something, she urged herself.  You will never make Ser Harry love you if you don’t have the courage to talk him.  Should she tell him what a good dancer he was?  No, he’s probably heard that a dozen times tonight.  Besides, Petyr said that I should not seem eager.  Instead she said, “I have heard that you are about to be a father.”  It was not something most girls would say to their almost-betrothed, but she wanted to see if Ser Harrold would lie.</p>\n<p>“For the second time. My daughter Alys is two years old.”</p>\n<p>Your bastard daughter Alys, Alayne thought, but what she said was, “That one had a different mother, though.”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Cissy was a pretty thing when I tumbled her, but childbirth left her as fat as a cow, so Lady Anya arranged for her to marry one of her men-at-arms.  It is different with Saffron.”</p>\n<p>“Saffron?”  Alayne tried not to laugh.  “Truly?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold had the grace to blush.  “Her father says she is more precious to him than gold.  He’s rich, the richest man in Gulltown.  A fortune in spices.”</p>\n<p>“What will you name the babe?” she asked.  “Cinnamon if she’s a girl?  Cloves if he’s a boy?”</p>\n<p>That almost made him stumble.  “My lady japes.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no.”  Petyr will howl when I tell him what I said.</p>\n<p>“Saffron is very beautiful, I’ll have you know.  Tall and slim, with big brown eyes and hair like honey.”</p>\n<p>Alayne raised her head.  “More beautiful than me?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold studied her face. “You are comely enough, I grant you.  When Lady Anya first told me of this match, I was afraid that you might look like your father.”</p>\n<p>“Little pointy beard and all?”  Alayne laughed.</p>\n<p>“I never meant… “</p>\n<p>“I hope you joust better than you talk.”</p>\n<p>For a moment he looked shocked.  But as the song was ending, he burst into a laugh.  “No one told me you were clever.”</p>\n<p>He has good teeth, she thought, straight and white.  And when he smiles, he has the nicest dimples.  She ran one finger down his cheek.  “Should we ever wed, you’ll have to send Saffron back to her father.  I’ll be all the spice you’ll want.”</p>\n<p>He grinned.  “I will hold you to that promise, my lady.  Until that day, may I wear your favor in the tourney?”</p>\n<p>“You may not.  It is promised to… another.”  She was not sure who as yet, but she knew she would find someone.</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"<h2 id=\"ALAYNE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\"><a href=\"#ALAYNE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ALAYNE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\"></a>ALAYNE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER</h2><p>She was reading her little lord a tale of the Winged Knight when Mya Stone came knocking on the door of his bedchamber, clad in boots and riding leathers and smelling strongly of the stable. Mya had straw in her hair and a scowl on her face. That scowl comes of having Mychel Redfort near, Alayne knew.</p>\n<p>“Your lordship,” Mya informed Lord Robert, “Lady Waynwood’s banners have been seen an hour down the road. She will be here soon, with your cousin Harry. Will you want to greet them?”</p>\n<p>Why did she have to mention Harry? Alayne thought. We will never get Sweetrobin out of bed now. The boy slapped a pillow. “Send them away. I never asked them here.”<br>","more":"<br>Mya looked nonplussed. No one in the Vale was better at handling a mule, but lordlings were another matter. “They were invited,” she said uncertainly, “for the tourney. I don’t… “</p>\n<p>Alayne closed her book.  “Thank you, Mya. Let me talk with Lord Robert, if you would.”</p>\n<p>Relief plain on her face, Mya fled without another word.</p>\n<p>“I hate that Harry,” Sweetrobin said when she was gone. “He calls me cousin, but he’s just waiting for me to die so he can take the Eyrie. He thinks I don’t know, but I do.”</p>\n<p>“Your lordship should not believe such nonsense,” Alayne said. “I’m sure Ser Harrold loves you well.” And if the gods are good, he will love me too. Her tummy gave a little flutter.</p>\n<p>“He doesn’t,” Lord Robert insisted. “He wants my father’s castle, that’s all, so he pretends.” The boy clutched the blanket to his pimply chest. “I don’t want you to marry him, Alayne. I am the Lord of the Eyrie, and I forbid it.” He sounded as if he were about to cry. “You should marry me instead. We could sleep in the same bed every night, and you could read me stories.”</p>\n<p>No man can wed me so long as my dwarf husband still lives somewhere in this world. Queen Cersei had collected the head of a dozen dwarfs, Petyr claimed, but none were Tyrion’s. “Sweetrobin, you must not say such things. You are the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, and you must wed a highborn lady and father a son to sit in the High Hall of House Arryn after you are gone.”</p>\n<p>Robert wiped his nose. “But I want — “</p>\n<p>She put a finger to his lips. “I know what you want, but it cannot be. I am no fit wife for you. I am bastard born.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t care. I love you best of anyone. “</p>\n<p>You are such a little fool.  “Your lords bannermen will care. Some call my father upjumped and ambitious. If you were to take me to wife, they would say that he made you do it, that it was no will of yours. The Lords Declarant might take arms against him once again, and he and I should both be put to death.”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t let them hurt you!” Lord Robert said. “If they try I will make them all fly.” His hand began to tremble.</p>\n<p>Alayne stroked his fingers. “There, my Sweetrobin, be still now.” When the shaking passed, she said, “You must have a proper wife, a trueborn maid of noble birth.”</p>\n<p>“No. I want to marry you, Alayne.”</p>\n<p>Once your lady mother intended that very thing, but I was trueborn then, and noble. “My lord is kind to say so.” Alayne smoothed his hair. Lady Lysa had never let the servants touch it, and after she had died Robert had suffered terrible shaking fits whenever anyone came near him with a blade, so it had been allowed to grow until it tumbled over his round shoulders and halfway down his flabby white chest. He does have pretty hair.  If the gods are good and he lives long enough to wed, his wife will admire his hair, surely.  That much she will love about him. “Any child of ours would be baseborn. Only a trueborn child of House Arryn can displace Ser Harrold as your heir. My father will find a proper wife for you, some highborn girl much prettier than me. You’ll hunt and hawk together, and she’ll give you her favor to wear in tournaments. Before long, you will have forgotten me entirely.”</p>\n<p>“I won’t!”</p>\n<p>“You will. You must.” Her voice was firm, but gentle.</p>\n<p>“The Lord of the Eyrie can do as he likes. Can’t I still love you, even if I have to marry her? Ser Harrold has a common woman. Benjicot says she’s carrying his bastard.”</p>\n<p>Benjicot should learn to keep his fool’s mouth shut. “Is that what you would have from me? A bastard?” She pulled her fingers from his grasp. “Would you dishonor me that way?”</p>\n<p>The boy looked stricken. “No. I never meant — “</p>\n<p>Alayne stood. “If it please my lord, I must go and find my father. Someone needs to greet Lady Waynwood.” Before her little lord could find the words to protest, she gave him a quick curtsy and fled the bedchamber, sweeping down the hall and across a covered bridge to the Lord Protector’s apartments.</p>\n<p>When she had left Petyr Baelish that morning he had been breaking his fast with old Oswell who had arrived last night from Gulltown on a lathered horse. She hoped they might still be talking, but Petyr’s solar proved empty. Someone had left a window open and a stack of papers had blown onto the floor. The sun was slanting through the thick yellow windows, and dust motes danced in the light like tiny golden insects. Though snow had blanketed the heights of the Giant’s Lance above, below the mountain the autumn lingered and winter wheat was ripening in the fields.  Outside the window she could hear the laughter of the washerwomen at the well, the din of steel on steel from the ward where the knights were at their drills. Good sounds.</p>\n<p>Alayne loved it here. She felt alive again, for the first since her father… since Lord Eddard Stark had died.</p>\n<p>She closed the window, gathered up the fallen papers, and stacked them on the table. One was a list of the competitors. Four-and-sixty knights had been invited to vie for places amongst Lord Robert Arryn’s  new Brotherhood of Winged Knights, and four­ and-sixty knights had come to tilt for the right to wear falcon’s wings upon their warhelms and guard their lord.</p>\n<p>The competitors came from all over the Vale, from the mountain valleys and the coast, from Gulltown and the Bloody Gate, even the Three Sisters. Though a few were promised, only three were wed; the eight victors would be expected to spend the next three years at Lord Robert’s side, as his own personal guard (Alayne had suggested seven, like the Kingsguard, but Sweetrobin had insisted that he must have more knights than King Tommen), so older men with wives and children had not been invited.</p>\n<p>And they came, Alayne thought proudly. They all came.</p>\n<p>It had fallen out just as Petyr said it would, the day the ravens flew. “They’re young, eager, hungry for adventure and renown. Lysa would not let them go to war. This is the next best thing. A chance to serve their lord and prove their prowess. They will come. Even Harry the Heir.” He had smoothed her hair and kissed her forehead. “What a clever daughter you are.”</p>\n<p>It was clever. The tourney, the prizes, the winged knights, it had all been her own notion. Lord Robert’s mother had filled him full of fears, but he always took courage from the tales she read him of Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight of legend, founder of his line. Why not surround him with Winged Knights?  She had thought one night, after Sweetrobin had finally drifted off to sleep. His own Kingsguard, to keep him safe and make him brave. And no sooner did she tell Petyr her idea than he went out and made it happen. He will want to be there to greet Ser Harrold. Where could he have gone?</p>\n<p>Alayne swept down the tower stairs to enter the pillared gallery at the back of the Great Hall. Below her, serving men were setting up trestle tables for the evening feast, while their wives and daughters swept up the old rushes and scattered fresh ones. Lord Nestor was showing Lady Waxley his prize tapestries, with their scenes of hunt and chase. The same panels had once hung in the Red Keep of King’s Landing, when Robert sat the Iron Throne. Joffrey had them taken down and they had languished in some cellar until Petyr Baelish arranged for them to be brought to the Vale as a gift for Nestor Royce. Not only were the hangings beautiful, but the High Steward delighted in telling anyone who’d listen that they had once belonged to a king.</p>\n<p>Petyr was not in the Great Hall. Alayne crossed the gallery and descended the stair built into the thick west wall, to come out in the inner ward, where the jousting would be held. Viewing stands had raised for all those who had come to watch, with four long tilting barriers in between. Lord Nestor’s men were painting the barriers with whitewash, draping the stands with bright banners, and hanging shields on the gate the competitors would pass through when they made their entrance.</p>\n<p>At the north end of the yard, three quintains had been set up, and some of the competitors were riding at them. Alayne knew them by their shields; the bells of Belmore, green vipers for the Lynderlys, the red sledge of Breakstone, House Tollett’s black and grey pily. Ser Mychel Redfort set one quintain spinning with a perfectly placed blow. He was one of those favored to win wings.</p>\n<p>Petyr was not at the quintains, nor anywhere in the yard, but as she turned to go a woman’s voice called out. “Alayne!” cried Myranda Royce, from a carved stone bench beneath a beech tree, where she was seated between two men. She looked in need of rescue. Smiling, Alayne walked toward her friend.</p>\n<p>Myranda was wearing a grey woolen dress, a green hooded cloak, and a rather desperate look. On either side of her sat a knight. The one on her right had a grizzled beard, a bald head, and a belly that spilled over his swordbelt where his lap should have been. The one on her left was no more than eighteen, and skinny as a spear. His ginger-colored whiskers only partially served to disguise the angry red pimples that dotted his face.</p>\n<p>The bald knight wore a dark blue surcoat emblazoned with a huge pair of pink lips. The pimply-gingerlad countered with nine white seagulls on a field of brown, which marked him for a Shett of Gulltown. He was staring so intently at Myranda’s breasts that he hardly noticed Alayne until Myranda rose to hug her. “Thank you, thank you, thank you ” Randa whispered in her ear, before she turned to say, “Sers, may I present you the Lady Alayne Stone?”</p>\n<p>“The Lord Protector’s daughter,” the bald knight announced, all hearty gallantry. He rose ponderously. “And full as lovely as the tales told of her, I see.”</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, the pimply knight hopped up and said,  “Ser Ossifer speaks truly, you are the most beautiful maid in all the Seven Kingdoms.” It might have been a sweeter courtesy had he not addressed it to her chest.</p>\n<p>“And have you seen all those maids yourself, ser?” Alayne asked him. “You are young to be so widely travelled.”</p>\n<p>He blushed, which only made his pimples look angrier.  “No, my lady.   I am from Gulltown.”</p>\n<p>And I am not, though Alayne was born there. She would need to be careful around this one. “I remember Gulltown fondly,” she told him, with a smile as vague as it was pleasant. To Myranda she said, “Do you know where my father’s gotten to, perchance?”</p>\n<p>“Let me take you to him, my lady.”</p>\n<p>“I do hope you will forgive me for depriving you of Lady Myranda’s company,” Alayne told the knights. She did not wait for a reply, but took the older girl arm-in-arm and drew her away from the bench. Only when they were out of earshot did she whisper,  “Do you really know where my father is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not. Walk faster, my new suitors may be following.” Myranda made a face. “Ossifer Lipps is the dullest knight in the Vale, but Uther Shett aspires to his laurels. I am praying they fight a duel for my hand, and kill each other.”</p>\n<p>Alayne giggled. “Surely Lord Nestor would not seriously entertain a suit from such men.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, he might. My lord father is annoyed with me for killing my last husband and putting him to all this trouble.”</p>\n<p>“It was not your fault he died.”</p>\n<p>“There was no one else in the bed that I recall.”</p>\n<p>Alayne could not help but shutter. Myranda’s husband had died when he was making love with her. “Those Sistermen who came in yesterday were gallant,” she said, to change the subject. “If you don’t like Ser Ossifer or Ser Uther, marry one of them instead. I thought the youngest one was very handsome.”</p>\n<p>“The one in the sealskin cloak?” Randa said, incredulous.</p>\n<p>“One of his brothers, then.”</p>\n<p>Myranda rolled her eyes. “They’re from the Sisters. Did you ever know a Sisterman who could joust? They clean their swords with codfish oil and wash in tubs of cold seawater.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Alayne said, “at least they’re clean.”</p>\n<p>“Some of them have webs between their toes. I’d sooner marry Lord Petyr. Then I’d be your mother. How little is his finger, I ask you?”</p>\n<p>Alayne did not dignify that question with an answer. “Lady Waynwood will be here soon, with her sons.”</p>\n<p>“Is that a promise or a threat?” Myranda said. “The first Lady Waynwood must have been a mare, I think. How else to explain why all the Waynwood men are horse-faced? If I were ever to wed a Waynwood, he would have to swear a vow to don his helm whenever he wished to fuck me, and keep the visor closed.” She gave Alayne a pinch on the arm. “My Harry will be with them, though. I notice that you left him out. I shall never forgive you for stealing him away from me. He’s the boy I want to marry.”</p>\n<p>“The betrothal was my father’s doing,”  Alayne protested, as she had a hundred times before.  She is only teasing, she told herself… but behind the japes, she could hear the hurt.</p>\n<p>Myranda stopped to gaze across the yard at the knights at their practice. “Now there’s the very sort of husband I need.”</p>\n<p>A few feet away, two knights were fighting with blunted practice swords. Their blades crashed together twice, then slipped past each other only to be blocked by upraised shields, but the bigger man gave ground at the impact. Alayne could not see the front of his shield from where she stood, but his attacker bore three ravens in flight, each clutching a red heart in its claws. Three hearts and three ravens.</p>\n<p>She knew right then how the fight would end.</p>\n<p>A few moments later and the big man sprawled dazed in the dust with his helm askew. When his squire undid the fastenings to bare his head, there was blood trickling down his scalp. If the swords had not been blunted, there would be brains as well. That last head blow had been so hard Alayne had winced in sympathy when it fell. Myranda Royce considered the victor thoughtfully.  “Do you think if I asked nicely Ser Lyn would kill my suitors for me?”</p>\n<p>“He might, for a plump bag of gold.” Ser Lyn Corbray was forever desperately short of coin, all the Vale knew that.</p>\n<p>“Alas, all I have is a plump pair of teats. Though with Ser Lyn, a plump sausage under my skirts would serve me better.”</p>\n<p>Alayne’s giggle drew Corbray’s attention. He handed his shield to his loutish squire, removed his helm and quilted coif.  “Ladies.” His long brown hair was plastered to his brow by sweat.</p>\n<p>“Well struck, Ser Lyn,” Alayne called out. “Though I fear you’ve knocked poor Ser Owen insensible.”</p>\n<p>Corbray glanced back to where his foe was being helped from the yard by his squire. “He had no sense to start with, or he should not have tried me.”</p>\n<p>There is truth in that, Alayne thought, but some demon of mischief was in her that morning, so she gave Ser Lyn a thrust of her own. Smiling sweetly, she said, “My lord father tells me your brother’s new wife is with child.”</p>\n<p>Corbray gave her a dark look. “Lyonel sends his regrets. He remains at Heart’s Home with his peddler’s daughter, watching her belly swell as if he were the first man who ever got a wench pregnant.”</p>\n<p>Oh, that’s an open wound, thought Alayne. Lyonel Corbray’s first wife had given him nothing but a frail, sickly babe who died in infancy, and during all those years Ser Lyn had remained his brother’s heir. When the poor woman finally died, however, Petyr Baelish had stepped in and brokered a new marriage for Lord Corbray. The second Lady Corbray was sixteen, the daughter of a wealthy Gulltown merchant, but she had come with an immense dowry, and men said she was a tall, strapping, healthy girl, with big breasts and good, wide hips. And fertile too, it seems.</p>\n<p>“We are all praying that the Mother grants Lady Corbray an easy labor and a healthy child,” said Myranda.</p>\n<p>Alayne could not help herself. She smiled and said, “My father is always pleased to be of service to one of Lord Robert’s leal bannermen. I’m sure he would be most delighted to help broker a marriage for you as well, Ser Lyn.”</p>\n<p>“How kind of him.” Corbray’s lips drew back in something that might have been meant as a smile, though it gave Alayne a chill. “But what need have I for heirs when I am landless and like to remain so, thanks to our Lord Protector?  No.  Tell your lord father I need none of his brood mares.”</p>\n<p>The venom in his voice was so thick that for a moment she almost forgot that Lyn Corbray was actually her father’s catspaw, bought and paid for. Or was he?  Perhaps, instead of being Petyr’s man pretending to be Petyr’s foe, he was actually his foe pretending to be his man pretending to be his foe.</p>\n<p>Just thinking about it was enough to make her head spin. Alayne turned abruptly from the yard… and bumped into a short, sharp-faced man with a brush of orange hair who had come up behind her.  His hand shot out and caught her arm before she could fall.   “My lady.  My pardons if I took you unawares.”</p>\n<p>“The fault was mine. I did not see you standing there.”</p>\n<p>“We mice are quiet creatures.” Ser Shadrich was so short that he might have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much older man. She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of his mouth, old battles in the scar beneath his ear, and a hardness behind the eyes that no boy would ever have. This was a man grown. Even Randa overtopped him, though.</p>\n<p>“Will you be seeking wings?” the Royce girl said.</p>\n<p>“A mouse with wings would be a silly sight.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps you will try the melee instead?” Alayne suggested.  The melee was an afterthought, a sop for all the brothers, uncles, fathers, and friends who had accompanied the competitors to the Gates of the Moon to see them win their silver wings, but there would be prizes for the champions, and a chance to win ransoms.</p>\n<p>“A good melee is all a hedge knight can hope for, unless he stumbles on a bag of dragons. And that’s not likely, is it?”</p>\n<p>“I suppose not. But now you must excuse us, ser, we need to find my lord father. “</p>\n<p>Horns sounded from atop the wall.  “Too late,” Myranda said. “They’re here.  We shall need to do the honors by ourselves.”  She grinned.   “Last one to the gate must marry Uther Shett.”</p>\n<p>They made a race of it, dashing headlong across the yard and past the stables, skirts flapping, whilst knights and serving men alike looked on, and pigs and chickens scattered before them. It was most unladylike, but Alayne sound found herself laughing. For just a little while, as she ran, she forget who she was, and where, and found herself remembering bright cold days at Winterfell, when she would race through Winterfell with her friend Jeyne Poole, with Arya running after them trying to keep up.</p>\n<p>By the time they arrived at the gatehouse, both of them were red-faced and panting. Myranda had lost her cloak somewhere along the way. They were just in time. The portcullis had been raised, and a column of riders twenty strong were passing underneath. At their head rode Anya Waynwood, Lady of Ironoaks, stern and slim, her grey-brown hair bound up in a scarf. Her riding cloak was heavy green wool trimmed with brown fur, and clasped at the throat by a niello brooch in the shape of the broken wheel of her House.</p>\n<p>Myranda Royce stepped forward and sketched a curtsy. “Lady Anya. Welcome to the Gates of the Moon.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Myranda. Lady Alayne.” Anya Waynwood inclined her head to each of them in turn. “It is good of you to greet us. Allow me to present my grandson, Ser Roland Waynwood.”  She nodded at the knight who had spoken.  “And this is my youngest son, Ser Wallace Waynwood.  And of course my ward, Ser Harrold Hardyng.”</p>\n<p>Harry the Heir, Alayne thought. My husband-to-be, if he will have me.  A sudden terror filled her.  She wondered if her face was red. Don’t stare at him, she reminded herself, don’t stare, don’t gape, don’t gawk.  Look away. Her hair must be a frightful mess after all that running.  It took all her will to stop herself from trying to tuck the loose strands back into place. Never mind your stupid hair.  Your hair doesn’t matter.  It’s him that matters.  Him, and the Waynwoods.</p>\n<p>Ser Roland was the oldest of the three, though no more than five-and-twenty. He was taller and more muscular than Ser Wallace, but both were long-faced and lantern-jawed, with stringy brown hair and pinched noses.  Horsefaced and homely, Alayne thought.</p>\n<p>Harry, though…</p>\n<p>My Harry.  My lord, my lover, my betrothed.</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold Hardyng looked every inch a lord-in-waiting; clean-limbed and handsome, straight as a lance, hard with muscle. Men old enough to have known Jon Arryn in his youth said Ser Harrold had his look, she knew. He had a mop of sandy blond hair, pale blue eyes, an aquiline nose. Joffrey was comely too, though, she reminded herself.   A comely monster, that’s what he was.  Little Lord Tyrion was kinder, twisted though he was.</p>\n<p>Harry was staring at her. He knows who I am, she realized, and he does not seem pleased to see me. It was only then that she took note of his heraldry. Though his surcoat and horse trappings were patterned in the red-and-white diamonds of House Hardyng, his shield was quartered. The arms of Hardyng and Waynwood were displayed in the first and third quarters, respectively, but in the second and fourth quarters he bore the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky blue and cream. Sweetrobin will not like that.</p>\n<p>Ser Wallace said, “Are we the l-l-last?”</p>\n<p>“You are, sers,” replied Myranda Royce, taking absolutely no notice of his stammer.</p>\n<p>“Wh-wh-when will the t-t-tilts commence?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, soon, I pray,” said Randa. “Some of the competitors have been here for almost a moon’s turn, partaking of my father’s meat and mead. All good fellows, and very brave… but they do eat rather a lot.”</p>\n<p>The Waynwoods laughed, and even Harry the Heir cracked a thin smile. “It was snowing in the passes, else we would have been here sooner,” said Lady Anya.</p>\n<p>“Had we known such beauty awaited us at the Gates, we would have flown,” Ser Roland said.  Though his words were addressed to Myranda Royce, he smiled at Alayne as he said them.</p>\n<p>“To fly you would need wings,” Randa replied, “and there are some knights here who might have a thing to say concerning that.”</p>\n<p>“I look forward to a spirited discussion.” Ser Roland swung down from his horse, turned to Alayne, and smiled.  “I had heard that Lord Littlefinger’s daughter was fair of face and full of grace, but no one ever told me that she was a thief.”</p>\n<p>“You wrong me, ser. I am no thief!”</p>\n<p>Ser Roland placed his hand over his heart. “Then how do you explain this hole in my chest, from where you stole my heart?”</p>\n<p>“He is only t-teasing you, my lady,” stammered Ser Wallace. “My n-n-nephew never had a h-h-heart.”</p>\n<p>“The Waynwood wheel has a broken spoke, and we have my nuncle here.” Ser Roland gave Wallace a whap behind the ear.  “Squires should be quiet when knights are speaking.”</p>\n<p>Ser Wallace reddened.  “I am no more a s-squire, my lady.  My n-nephew knows full well that I was k-k-kni-k-k-kni –“</p>\n<p>“Dubbed?” Alayne suggested gently.</p>\n<p>“Dubbed,” said Wallace Waynwood, gratefully.</p>\n<p>Robb would be his age, if he were still alive, she could not help but think, but Robb died a king, and this is just a boy.</p>\n<p>“My lord father has assigned you rooms in the East Tower,” Lady Myranda was telling Lady Waynwood, “but I fear your knights will need to share a bed. The Gates of the Moon were never meant to house so many noble visitors.”</p>\n<p>“You are in the Falcon Tower, Ser Harrold,” Alayne put in. Far away from Sweetrobin. That was intentional, she knew. Petyr Baelish did not leave such things to chance. “If it please you, I will show you to your chambers myself.” This time her eyes met Harry’s.  She smiled just for him, and said a silent prayer to the Maiden. Please, he doesn’t need to love me, just make him like me, just a little, that would be enough for now.</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold looked down at her coldly. “Why should it please me to be escorted anywhere by Littlefinger’s bastard?”</p>\n<p>All three Waynwoods looked at him askance. “You are a guest here, Harry,” Lady Anya reminded him, in a frosty voice. “See that you remember that.”</p>\n<p>A lady’s armor is her courtesy. Alayne could feel the blood rushing to her face. No tears, she prayed. Please, please, I must not cry. “As you wish, ser. And now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger’s bastard must find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can begin the tourney on the morrow.”  And may your horse stumble, Harry the Heir, so you fall on your stupid head in your first tilt. She showed the Waynwoods a stone face as they blurted out awkward apologies for their companion. When they were done she turned and fled.</p>\n<p>Near the keep, she ran headlong into Ser Lothor Brune and almost knocked him off his feet. “Harry the Heir?  Harry the Arse, I say. He’s just some upjumped squire.”</p>\n<p>Alayne was so grateful that she hugged him. “Thank you. Have you seen my father, ser?”</p>\n<p>“Down in the vaults, ” Ser Lothar said, “inspecting Lord Nestor’s granaries with Lord Grafton and Lord Belmore.”</p>\n<p>The vaults were large and dark and filthy. Alayne lit a taper and clutched her skirt as she made the descent. Near the bottom, she heard Lord Grafton’s booming voice, and followed.”The merchants are clamoring to buy, and the lords are clamoring to sell,” the Gulltowner was saying when she found them.  Though not a tall man, Grafton was wide, with thick arms and shoulders.  His hair was a dirty blond mop.  “How am I to stop that, my lord?”</p>\n<p>“Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does not matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale. “</p>\n<p>“These prices, though,”  protested fat Lord Belmore,”  these prices are more than fair.”</p>\n<p>“You say more than fair, my lord.  I say less than we would wish.  Wait.  If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored.  Winter is coming.  Prices must go higher.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps,”  said Belmore, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>“Bronze Yohn will not wait, ”  Grafton complained.  “He need not ship through Gulltown, he has his own ports.  Whilst we are hoarding our harvest, Royce and the other Lords Declarant will turn theirs into silver, you may be sure of that.”</p>\n<p>“Let us hope so,”  said Petyr.  “When their granaries are empty, they will need every scrap of that silver to buy sustenance from us.  And now if you will excuse me, my lord, it would seem my daughter has need of me.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Alayne,” Lord Grafton said. “You look bright-eyed this morning.”</p>\n<p>“You are kind to say so, my lord. Father, I am sorry to disturb you, but I thought you would want to know that the Waynwoods have arrived.”</p>\n<p>“And is Ser Harrold with them?”</p>\n<p>Horrible Ser Harrold.  “ He is.”</p>\n<p>Lord Belmore laughed. “I never thought Royce would let him come. Is he blind, or merely stupid?”</p>\n<p>“He is honorable.  Sometimes it amounts to the same thing.  If he denied the lad the chance to prove himself, it could create a rift between them, so why not let him tilt?  The boy is nowise skilled enough to win a place amongst the Winged Knights.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose not,” said Belmore, grudgingly.  Lord Grafton kissed Alayne on the hand, and the two lords went off, leaving her alone with her lord father.</p>\n<p>“Come,” Petyr said, “walk with me.”  He took her by the arm and led her deeper into the vaults, past an empty dungeon.  “And how was your first meeting with Harry the Heir?”</p>\n<p>“He’s horrible.”</p>\n<p>“The world is full of horrors, sweet.  By now you ought to know that.  You’ve seen enough of them.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said, “but why must he be so cruel?  He called me your bastard.  Right in the yard, in front of everyone.”</p>\n<p>“So far as he knows, that’s who you are.  This betrothal was never his idea, and Bronze Yohn has no doubt warned him against my wiles.  You are my daughter.  He does not trust you, and he believes that you’re beneath him.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not.  He may think he’s some great knight, but Ser Lothor says he’s just some upjumped squire.”</p>\n<p>Petyr put his arm around her.  “So he is, but he is Robert’s heir as well.  Bringing Harry here was the first step in our plan, but now we need to keep him, and only you can do that.  He has a weakness for a pretty face, and whose face is prettier than yours?  Charm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how,”  she said miserably.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I think you do,” said Littlefinger, with one of those smiles that did not reach his eyes.  “You will be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight, as lovely as your lady mother at your age.  I cannot seat you on the dais, but you’ll have a place of honor above the salt and underneath a wall sconce.  The fire will be shining in your hair, so everyone will see how fair of face you are.  Keep a good long spoon on hand to beat the squires off, sweetling.  You will not want green boys underfoot when the knights come round to beg you for your favor.”</p>\n<p>“Who would ask to wear a bastard’s favor?”</p>\n<p>“Harry, if he has the wits the gods gave a goose… but do not give it to him.  Choose some other gallant, and favor him instead.  You do not want to seem too eager.”</p>\n<p>“No,” Alayne said.</p>\n<p>“Lady Waynwood will insist that Harry dance with you, I can promise you that much.  That will be your chance. Smile at the boy.  Touch him when you speak.  Tease him, to pique his pride.  If he seems to be responding, tell him that you are feeling faint, and ask him to take you outside for a breath of fresh air.  No knight could refuse such a request from a fair maiden.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said, “but he thinks that I’m a bastard.”</p>\n<p>“A beautiful bastard, and the Lord Protector’s daughter.”  Petyr drew her close and kissed her on both cheeks.  “The night belongs to you, sweetling, Remember that, always.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll try, father,” she said.</p>\n<p>The feast proved to be everything her father promised.</p>\n<p>Sixty-four dishes were served, in honor of the sixty-four competitors who had come so far to contest for silver wings before their lord. From the rivers and the lakes came pike and trout and salmon, from the seas crabs and cod and herring. Ducks there were, and capons, peacocks in their plumage and swans in almond milk. Suckling pigs were served up crackling with apples in their mouths, and three huge aurochs were roasted whole above firepits in the castle yard, since they were too big to get through the kitchen doors. Loaves of hot bread filled the trestle tables in Lord Nestor’s hall, and massive wheels of cheese were brought up from the vaults.  The butter was fresh-churned, and there were leeks and carrots, roasted onions, beets, turnips, parsnips.  And best of all, Lord Nestor’s cooks prepared a splendid subtlety, a lemon cake in the shape of the Giant’s Lance, twelve feet tall and adorned with an Eyrie made of sugar.</p>\n<p>For me, Alayne thought, as they wheeled it out.  Sweetrobin loved lemon cakes too, but only after she told him that they were her favorites.  The cake had required every lemon in the Vale, but Petyr had promised that he would send to Dorne for more.</p>\n<p>There were gifts as well, splendid gifts.  Each of the competitors received a cloak of cloth-of-silver and a lapis brooch in the shape of a pair of falcon’s wings.  Fine steel daggers were given to the brothers, fathers, and friends who had come to watch them tilt.  For their mothers, sisters, and ladies fair there were bolts of silk and Myrish lace.</p>\n<p>“Lord Nestor has an open hand,” Alayne heard Ser Edmund Breakstone say.  “An open hand and a little finger,” Lady Waynwood replied, with a nod toward Petyr Baelish.   Breakstone was not slow to take her meaning.  The true source of this largesse was not Lord Nestor, but the Lord Protector.</p>\n<p>When the last course had been served and cleared, the tables were lifted from their trestles to clear the floor for dancing, and musicians were brought in.</p>\n<p>“Are there no singers?” asked Ben Coldwater.</p>\n<p>“The little lord cannot abide them,” Ser Lymond Lynderly replied.  “Not since Marillion.”</p>\n<p>“Ah… that was the man who murdered Lady Lysa, yes?”</p>\n<p>Alayne spoke up. “His singing pleased her greatly, and she showed him too much favor, perhaps.  When she wed my father he went mad and pushed her out the Moon Door.  Lord Robert has hated singing ever since.  He is still fond of music, though.”</p>\n<p>“As am I,” Coldwater said.  Rising, he offered Alayne his hand.  “Would you honor me with this dance, my lady?”</p>\n<p>“You’re very kind,” she said, as he led her to the floor.</p>\n<p>He was her first partner of the evening, but far from the last.  Just as Petyr had promised, the young knights flocked around her, vying for her favor.  After Ben came Andrew Tollett, handsome Ser Byron, red-nosed Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse.  Then Ser Albar Royce, Myranda’s stout dull brother and Lord Nestor’s heir.  She danced with all three Sunderlands, none of whom had webs between their fingers, though she could not vouch for their toes.  Uther Shett appeared to pay her slimy compliments as he trod upon her feet, but Ser Targon the Halfwild proved to be the soul of courtesy.  After that Ser Roland Waynwood swept her up and made her laugh with mocking comments about half the other knights in the hall.  His uncle Wallace took a turn as well and tried to do the same, but the words would not come.  Alayne finally took pity on him and began to chatter happily, to spare him the embarrassment.  When the dance was done she excused herself, and went back to her place to have a drink of wine.</p>\n<p>And there he stood, Harry the Heir himself; tall, handsome, scowling.  “Lady Alayne. May I partner you in this dance?”</p>\n<p>She considered for a moment. “No. I don’t think so.”</p>\n<p>Color rose to his cheeks.  “I was unforgiveably rude to you in the yard.  You must forgive me.”</p>\n<p>“Must?” She tossed her hair, took a sip of wine, made him wait.  “How can you forgive someone who is unforgiveably rude?  Will you explain that to me, ser?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold looked confused. “Please.  One dance.”</p>\n<p>Charm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.  “If you insist.”</p>\n<p>He nodded, offered his arm, led her out onto the floor.  As they waited for the music to resume, Alayne glanced at the dais, where Lord Robert sat staring at them.  Please, she prayed, don’t let him start to twitch and shake.  Not here.  Not now.  Maester Coleman would have made certain that he drank a strong dose of sweetmilk before the feast, but even so.</p>\n<p>Then the musicians took up a tune, and she was dancing.</p>\n<p>Say something, she urged herself.  You will never make Ser Harry love you if you don’t have the courage to talk him.  Should she tell him what a good dancer he was?  No, he’s probably heard that a dozen times tonight.  Besides, Petyr said that I should not seem eager.  Instead she said, “I have heard that you are about to be a father.”  It was not something most girls would say to their almost-betrothed, but she wanted to see if Ser Harrold would lie.</p>\n<p>“For the second time. My daughter Alys is two years old.”</p>\n<p>Your bastard daughter Alys, Alayne thought, but what she said was, “That one had a different mother, though.”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Cissy was a pretty thing when I tumbled her, but childbirth left her as fat as a cow, so Lady Anya arranged for her to marry one of her men-at-arms.  It is different with Saffron.”</p>\n<p>“Saffron?”  Alayne tried not to laugh.  “Truly?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold had the grace to blush.  “Her father says she is more precious to him than gold.  He’s rich, the richest man in Gulltown.  A fortune in spices.”</p>\n<p>“What will you name the babe?” she asked.  “Cinnamon if she’s a girl?  Cloves if he’s a boy?”</p>\n<p>That almost made him stumble.  “My lady japes.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no.”  Petyr will howl when I tell him what I said.</p>\n<p>“Saffron is very beautiful, I’ll have you know.  Tall and slim, with big brown eyes and hair like honey.”</p>\n<p>Alayne raised her head.  “More beautiful than me?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold studied her face. “You are comely enough, I grant you.  When Lady Anya first told me of this match, I was afraid that you might look like your father.”</p>\n<p>“Little pointy beard and all?”  Alayne laughed.</p>\n<p>“I never meant… “</p>\n<p>“I hope you joust better than you talk.”</p>\n<p>For a moment he looked shocked.  But as the song was ending, he burst into a laugh.  “No one told me you were clever.”</p>\n<p>He has good teeth, she thought, straight and white.  And when he smiles, he has the nicest dimples.  She ran one finger down his cheek.  “Should we ever wed, you’ll have to send Saffron back to her father.  I’ll be all the spice you’ll want.”</p>\n<p>He grinned.  “I will hold you to that promise, my lady.  Until that day, may I wear your favor in the tourney?”</p>\n<p>“You may not.  It is promised to… another.”  She was not sure who as yet, but she knew she would find someone.</p>"},{"title":"Android上的生命周期监控","comments":0,"date":"2018-07-23T05:36:11.000Z","_content":"做Android开发总是避免不了要处理各种生命周期，那么有没有什么优雅的方法呢？现在我就记录几种方法。\n<!-- more -->\n# Lifecycle  \n`Lifecycle`是Google在[Jetpack](https://developer.android.google.cn/jetpack/)中提出的，在包[`android.arch.lifecycle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/package-summary.html)下面，如果使用的是suppor包中的SupportActivity或者FragmentActivity已经继承了Lifecycle。使用的方法如下：\n```kotlin\nclass myFragmentActivity(val fragmentActivity: FragmentActivity) : LifecycleObserver {\n    init {\n     //在这里注册一下\n      fragmentActivity.lifecycle.addObserver(this)\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME)\n    fun onResume(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_RESUME\")\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE)\n    fun onPause(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_PAUSE\")\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_STOP)\n    fun onStop(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_STOP\")\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_DESTROY)\n    fun onDestroy(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_DESTROY\")\n    }\n}\n```\n这样就可以很方便去管理生命周期，也可以和原来的activity的方法解耦。也可以通过LifecycleOwner来管理生命周期\n```kotlin\nclass MyActivity : Activity(), LifecycleOwner {\n    lateinit var mLifecycleRegistry: LifecycleRegistry\n\n

}\n\n    override fun onFragmentDestroyed(fm: FragmentManager, f: Fragment) {\n      Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"onFragmentDestroyed\")\n    }\n}, true)\n```\n所以，通过为activity添加一个空白的fragment也是一种方法，然后fragment就可以获取到activity的生命周期了，Glide就是通过添加一个fragment来管理生命周期的。\n\n# ActivityLifecycleCallbacks\n如果要全局管理生命周期有没有什么办法呢？当然还是有的，可以设置全局的Application，然后在application里面注册监听，就可以处理所有的activity的生命周期了。记得及时释放掉。\n```kotlin\nregisterActivityLifecycleCallbacks(object :

\n`Lifecycle`是Google在[Jetpack](https://developer.android.google.cn/jetpack/)中提出的，在包[`android.arch.lifecycle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/package-summary.html)下面，如果使用的是suppor包中的SupportActivity或者FragmentActivity已经继承了Lifecycle。使用的方法如下：\n```kotlin\nclass myFragmentActivity(val fragmentActivity: FragmentActivity) : LifecycleObserver {\n    init {\n     //在这里注册一下\n      fragmentActivity.lifecycle.addObserver(this)\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME)\n    fun onResume(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_RESUME\")\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE)\n    fun onPause(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_PAUSE\")\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_STOP)\n    fun onStop(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_STOP\")\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_DESTROY)\n    fun onDestroy(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_DESTROY\")\n    }\n}\n```\n这样就可以很方便去管理生命周期，也可以和原来的activity的方法解耦。也可以通过LifecycleOwner来管理生命周期\n```kotlin\nclass MyActivity : Activity(), LifecycleOwner {\n    lateinit var mLifecycleRegistry: LifecycleRegistry\n\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n\n        mLifecycleRegistry = LifecycleRegistry(this)\n        mLifecycleRegistry.markState(Lifecycle.State.CREATED)\n    }\n\n    override fun onStart() {\n        super.onStart()\n        mLifecycleRegistry.markState(Lifecycle.State.STARTED)\n    }\n\n    //这里得到的就是生命周期的结果\n    override fun getLifecycle(): Lifecycle = mLifecycleRegistry\n}\n```\n这里不详细赘述里面的细节，只是记录一下使用的方法，有关细节可以查看官方文档。\n\n#

fun onFragmentStopped(fm: FragmentManager, f: Fragment) {\n      Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"onFragmentStopped\")\n      //fragment.requireFragmentManager().unregisterFragmentLifecycleCallbacks(this)\n    }\n\n    override fun onFragmentDestroyed(fm: FragmentManager, f: Fragment) {\n      Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"onFragmentDestroyed\")\n    }\n},

more -->\n原图如下![](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8433-8e884a696f70b1fb.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n\n# PorterDuffXfermode\n最开始想的是使用PorterDuffXfermode来处理，因为这种方式其实很快的，但是，虽然这种方式可以用来处理图片，但是无法满足获取图片边界的需求。\n代码如下：\n```java\n    public static Bitmap cutStickerBitmap(String name, Context context, Bitmap bitmap) {\n        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\n        Bitmap bit = Bitmap.createBitmap(bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight(), Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);\n        bit.eraseColor(Color.WHITE);\n        Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bit);\n\n        Paint paint = new Paint();\n        paint.setXfermode(new PorterDuffXfermode(PorterDuff.Mode.DST_IN));\n\n        canvas.drawBitmap(bitmap, 0, 0, paint);\n        Paint paintRect = new Paint();\n        paintRect.setColor(Color.RED);\n        paintRect.setAntiAlias(true);\n        paintRect.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);\n        paintRect.setStrokeWidth(4);\n        Rect rect = new Rect();\n        //画一个框表示边界\n        rect.set(0, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight());\n        canvas.drawRect(rect, paintRect);\n        Log.i(\"xx\", \" 运行时间 cutStickerBitmap \" + (Calendar.getInstance().getTimeInMillis() - calendar.getTimeInMillis()));\n        return bit;\n    }\n```\n代码处理的时间，可以看到时间很快，可惜不符合需求：\n![](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8433-cc2aeb6b5781d17d.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n处理的结果如下： ![](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8433-9c08301a7e609efd.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n\n\n# 自己写算法读像素\n关于这个算法，其实，我写过两个版本。 自己写算法的话，需要自己评估你自己的需求和结果。一开始，为了防止图形是不连续的，我采取的思路是从图片四周来获取边界。思路如图：\n![](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8433-7aa7fbf20e14fd18.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n这么做的确是可以保证百分百正确的，但是这么做有一个问题，那就是因为每次得到的图片分辨率不一样，在有的时候处理一次需要10s以上，这实在是太慢了。\n\n后来仔细观察之后发现，其实不需要那么严格的，因为得到的所有的图形都是连续的，所以新的算法就是从中间开始处理的。\n

Android关于裁剪图片透明区域的算法\ntags: Android\ncomments: false\ndate: 2019-05-27 18:49:53\n---\n最近项目中遇到这么一个需求，需要裁剪掉图片的透明区域。找了很久，最后确定，只能通过自己读取Bitmap的像素点来读取图片的边界来裁剪。下面记录一下过程。\n<!-- more

PorterDuffXfermode\n最开始想的是使用PorterDuffXfermode来处理，因为这种方式其实很快的，但是，虽然这种方式可以用来处理图片，但是无法满足获取图片边界的需求。\n代码如下：\n```java\n    public static Bitmap cutStickerBitmap(String name, Context context, Bitmap bitmap) {\n        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\n        Bitmap bit = Bitmap.createBitmap(bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight(), Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);\n        bit.eraseColor(Color.WHITE);\n        Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bit);\n\n        Paint paint = new Paint();\n        paint.setXfermode(new PorterDuffXfermode(PorterDuff.Mode.DST_IN));\n\n        canvas.drawBitmap(bitmap, 0, 0, paint);\n        Paint paintRect = new Paint();\n        paintRect.setColor(Color.RED);\n        paintRect.setAntiAlias(true);\n        paintRect.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);\n        paintRect.setStrokeWidth(4);\n        Rect rect = new Rect();\n        //画一个框表示边界\n        rect.set(0, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight());\n        canvas.drawRect(rect, paintRect);\n        Log.i(\"xx\", \" 运行时间 cutStickerBitmap \" + (Calendar.getInstance().getTimeInMillis() - calendar.getTimeInMillis()));\n        return bit;\n    }\n```\n代码处理的时间，可以看到时间很快，可惜不符合需求：\n![](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8433-cc2aeb6b5781d17d.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n处理的结果如下：

自己写算法的话，需要自己评估你自己的需求和结果。一开始，为了防止图形是不连续的，我采取的思路是从图片四周来获取边界。思路如图：\n![](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8433-7aa7fbf20e14fd18.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n这么做的确是可以保证百分百正确的，但是这么做有一个问题，那就是因为每次得到的图片分辨率不一样，在有的时候处理一次需要10s以上，这实在是太慢了。\n\n后来仔细观察之后发现，其实不需要那么严格的，因为得到的所有的图形都是连续的，所以新的算法就是从中间开始处理的。\n

webp的。那么如何处理呢？记录一下，不然坑都白踩了。本质上webp和gif都是一组图片组成的连续图片，如果要单独解析每一帧怎么办呢。\n<!-- more -->\n# Android支持\n如果要拿到webp的第一帧，在Android以上是可以直接使用如下这种方法，默认取的是第一帧，但是，这种方法只有在8.0及以上才有用。\n```java\n  Bitmap  bitmap =  BitmapFactory.decodeFile(filename);\n```\n\n# fresco控制animated webp\n添加`fresco`支持webp的方法是：\n```gradle\n  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:fresco:1.13.0'\n  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:1.13.0'\n//implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-gif:1.13.0'\n```\n添加之后就可以直接加载webp了，也可以设置自动开始播放，如下：\n```java\n  ImageRequestBuilder imageRequestBuilder = ImageRequestBuilder.newBuilderWithSource(uri);\n  PipelineDraweeControllerBuilder builder = Fresco.newDraweeControllerBuilder();\n  builder.setImageRequest(imageRequestBuilder.build());\n  builder.setAutoPlayAnimations(true);\n  builder.setControllerListener(new BaseControllerListener<ImageInfo>() {\n    @Override\n    public void onFinalImageSet(String id, ImageInfo imageInfo, Animatable animatable) {\n    //加载完成的监听\n    }\n  });\n  simpleDraweeView.setController(builder.build());\n```\n到这一步都很简单，但是要加载webp的第一帧咋办呢？\n先来一种最简单的，类似于`BitmapFactory.decodeFile()`，`fresco`中也有一个方法，同样的，这种方法也是仅支持8.0及以上\n```java\n  Bitmap bitmap = WebpSupportStatus\n                  .loadWebpBitmapFactoryIfExists()\n                  .decodeFile(filename, new BitmapFactory.Options());\n```\n那么还有什么办法呢？还可以使用下面这种方法。这种方法是用的是`fresco`的订阅者，可以处理加载之后的数据，可以拿到webp的每一帧，然后做你想要的处理，[官网链接](https://frescolib.org/docs/datasources-datasubscribers.html)。\n```java\n  ImageDecodeOptionsBuilder decodeOptionsBuilder = new ImageDecodeOptionsBuilder();\n  decodeOptionsBuilder.setDecodeAllFrames(true);\n  decodeOptionsBuilder.setBitmapConfig(Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);\n  ImagePipelineFactory.getInstance()\n          .getImagePipeline()\n          .fetchDecodedImage(ImageRequestBuilder\n                          .newBuilderWithSource(Uri.fromFile(new File(filename)))\n                          .setImageDecodeOptions(new ImageDecodeOptions(decodeOptionsBuilder))\n                          .build()\n                  , context)\n          .subscribe(new

Android支持\n如果要拿到webp的第一帧，在Android以上是可以直接使用如下这种方法，默认取的是第一帧，但是，这种方法只有在8.0及以上才有用。\n```java\n  Bitmap  bitmap =  BitmapFactory.decodeFile(filename);\n```\n\n# fresco控制animated webp\n添加`fresco`支持webp的方法是：\n```gradle\n  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:fresco:1.13.0'\n  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:1.13.0'\n//implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-gif:1.13.0'\n```\n添加之后就可以直接加载webp了，也可以设置自动开始播放，如下：\n```java\n  ImageRequestBuilder imageRequestBuilder = ImageRequestBuilder.newBuilderWithSource(uri);\n  PipelineDraweeControllerBuilder builder = Fresco.newDraweeControllerBuilder();\n  builder.setImageRequest(imageRequestBuilder.build());\n  builder.setAutoPlayAnimations(true);\n  builder.setControllerListener(new BaseControllerListener<ImageInfo>() {\n    @Override\n    public void onFinalImageSet(String id, ImageInfo imageInfo, Animatable animatable) {\n    //加载完成的监听\n    }\n  });\n  simpleDraweeView.setController(builder.build());\n```\n到这一步都很简单，但是要加载webp的第一帧咋办呢？\n先来一种最简单的，类似于`BitmapFactory.decodeFile()`，`fresco`中也有一个方法，同样的，这种方法也是仅支持8.0及以上\n```java\n  Bitmap bitmap =

  Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .into(imageView);\n```\n但是，当你在加载图片之前对图片做处理，我们可以怎么做呢？比如我这样的需求，第一次显示的时候加载左边，点击之后加载右边，显然直接用Glide加载是不行的。下面介绍一些踩过的坑。\n![](/images/icon_spine_unselected_1.png)\n\n# 1. Transformation 变换\n通过内置的一些变换类，可以达到一些处理效果，[详情参考](https://muyangmin.github.io/glide-docs-cn/doc/transformations.html#%E5%86%85%E7%BD%AE%E7%B1%BB%E5%9E%8B)\n```java\n   Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .transform(new CircleCrop())\n      .into(imageView);\n```\n当然也可以通过自定义一些手段来达到目的，[详情参考](https://muyangmin.github.io/glide-docs-cn/doc/transformations.html#%E5%AE%9A%E5%88%B6%E5%8F%98%E6%8D%A2)\n```java\nimport android.graphics.Bitmap;\nimport android.support.annotation.NonNull;\n\nimport com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.bitmap_recycle.BitmapPool;\nimport com.bumptech.glide.load.resource.bitmap.BitmapTransformation;\n\nimport java.security.MessageDigest;\n\n/**\n * Created by JayChou on 2019/3/5.\n */\npublic class GlideSelectIcon extends BitmapTransformation {\n    private static final String ID = \"yourpackagename.GlideSelectIcon\";\n    private static final byte[] ID_BYTES = ID.getBytes(CHARSET);\n\n    private boolean isSelect = false;\n\n    @Override\n    protected Bitmap transform(@NonNull BitmapPool pool, @NonNull Bitmap toTransform, int outWidth, int outHeight) {\n        Bitmap bitmap;\n        if (isSelect) {\n            bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(toTransform, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, 0, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, toTransform.getHeight()); //对图片的高度的一半进行裁剪\n        } else {\n            bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(toTransform, 0, 0, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, toTransform.getHeight()); //对图片的高度的一半进行裁剪\n        }\n        pool.put(bitmap);\n        return bitmap;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isSelect() {\n        return isSelect;\n    }\n\n    public void setSelect(boolean select) {\n        isSelect = select;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object o) {\n        return o instanceof GlideSelectIcon;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int hashCode() {\n        return ID_BYTES.hashCode();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void updateDiskCacheKey(@NonNull MessageDigest messageDigest) {\n        messageDigest.update(ID_BYTES);\n    }\n}\n```\n```java\n   Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .transform(new GlideSelectIcon())\n      .into(imageView);\n```\n需要注意的是，上面的方法是会直接处理掉图片的，`updateDiskCacheKey` 和`hashCode ` 和 `equals `都只是帮你处理缓存key的。如果你需要自己处理缓存，那就更新这几个地方就可以了，如果你只需要缓存原图可以用`.diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.RESOURCE)`的策略。\n\n这里有一个坑需要注意的是，这货如果你不是更新缓存的话，那么就不会走`BitmapTransformation.transform() `这个方法，也就是说只有第一次加载和更新缓存的时候才会走这个方法，所以这是一次性处理的效果。但是每次都更新缓存的话又太费流量了，还有啥办法呢？\n# 2. [Target 变换](https://muyangmin.github.io/glide-docs-cn/doc/targets.html#%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8Etarget)\n我这边的需求恰好是需要每次都更新一边图片，但是我又不想每次都刷新缓存，那么怎么办呢？就可以使用加载后的图片处理方法`ViewTarget`。\n\n```java\nimport android.graphics.Bitmap;\nimport android.graphics.Canvas;\nimport android.graphics.PixelFormat;\nimport android.graphics.drawable.Drawable;\nimport android.support.annotation.Nullable;\nimport android.widget.ImageView;\n\nimport com.bumptech.glide.Glide;\nimport com.bumptech.glide.request.target.DrawableImageViewTarget;\n\n/**\n * Created by JayChou on 2019/3/6.\n */\npublic class GlideSelectDrawableImageViewTarget extends DrawableImageViewTarget {\n\n    private boolean isSelect = false;\n\n    public GlideSelectDrawableImageViewTarget(ImageView view, boolean isSelect) {\n        super(view);\n        Glide.with(view).clear(view);\n        this.isSelect = isSelect;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void setResource(@Nullable Drawable resource) {\n        if (resource != null) {\n            Bitmap toTransform = drawableToBitmap(resource);\n            Bitmap bitmap;\n            if (isSelect) {\n                bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(toTransform, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, 0, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, toTransform.getHeight()); //对图片的高度的一半进行裁剪\n            } else {\n                bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(toTransform, 0, 0, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, toTransform.getHeight()); //对图片的高度的一半进行裁剪\n            }\n            view.setImageBitmap(bitmap);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public Bitmap drawableToBitmap(Drawable drawable) {\n        // 取 drawable 的长宽\n        int w = drawable.getIntrinsicWidth();\n        int h = drawable.getIntrinsicHeight();\n\n        // 取 drawable 的颜色格式\n        Bitmap.Config config = drawable.getOpacity() != PixelFormat.OPAQUE ? Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888\n                : Bitmap.Config.RGB_565;\n        // 建立对应 bitmap\n        Bitmap bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(w, h, config);\n        // 建立对应 bitmap 的画布\n        Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bitmap);\n        drawable.setBounds(0, 0, w, h);\n        // 把 drawable 内容画到画布中\n        drawable.draw(canvas);\n        return bitmap;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n然后添加到Glide中就可以了\n```java\n   Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .into(new GlideSelectDrawableImageViewTarget(imageView,true));\n```\n\n这里需要说明的地方是：\n我因为用的是`DrawableImageViewTarget`，所以自己把`drawable`转成了`Bitmap`来处理的，你也可以直接处理`drawable`。\n\n我每次都调用了一下`Glide.with(view).clear(view);`，是因为Glide在添加 `ViewTarget`之后，会针对当前的imageView做引用复用，所以除非你手动清理一遍ImagView的引用，否者每次新设置的`ViewTarget`都不会起作用，只会复用上一次的`ViewTarget`。\n\n这里踩了很长时间的坑，一直很奇怪的是`setResource`中的`isSelect`一直没有变化，排查了很久才发现这里，关于这一段的说明在[这里](https://muyangmin.github.io/glide-docs-cn/doc/targets.html#%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88%E5%92%8C%E9%87%8D%E7%94%A8)。\n![](/images/glide官方文档截图Target.png)\n\n---\n第一个是因为缓存的问题卡住了，第二个是因为对象引用卡住了。以上就是关于这次的Glide踩坑记录，论官方文档全看完并理解的重要性。\n","source":"_posts/Glide4的一次踩坑记录.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Glide4的一次踩坑记录\ntags: Android\ncomments: false\ndate: 2019-03-06 15:15:45\n---\n如果你用图片加载库直接加载图片，并不需要做任何处理，那么，其实大多数时候你用任何加载库并没有太大的区别。一旦你需要处理各种各样的图片的时候，你就会遇到各种各样的问题了。这里记录一个关于Glide的问题，一下都是Glide4.9版本。\n<!--more-->\n在Glide中加载图片，可以很简单，类似于这样就可以了：\n```java\n   Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .into(imageView);\n```\n但是，当你在加载图片之前对图片做处理，我们可以怎么做呢？比如我这样的需求，第一次显示的时候加载左边，点击之后加载右边，显然直接用Glide加载是不行的。下面介绍一些踩过的坑。\n![](/images/icon_spine_unselected_1.png)\n\n# 1.

Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888\n                : Bitmap.Config.RGB_565;\n        // 建立对应 bitmap\n        Bitmap bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(w, h, config);\n        // 建立对应 bitmap 的画布\n        Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bitmap);\n        drawable.setBounds(0, 0, w, h);\n        // 把 drawable 内容画到画布中\n        drawable.draw(canvas);\n        return bitmap;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n然后添加到Glide中就可以了\n```java\n   Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .into(new GlideSelectDrawableImageViewTarget(imageView,true));\n```\n\n这里需要说明的地方是：\n我因为用的是`DrawableImageViewTarget`，所以自己把`drawable`转成了`Bitmap`来处理的，你也可以直接处理`drawable`。\n\n我每次都调用了一下`Glide.with(view).clear(view);`，是因为Glide在添加 `ViewTarget`之后，会针对当前的imageView做引用复用，所以除非你手动清理一遍ImagView的引用，否者每次新设置的`ViewTarget`都不会起作用，只会复用上一次的`ViewTarget`。\n\n这里踩了很长时间的坑，一直很奇怪的是`setResource`中的`isSelect`一直没有变化，排查了很久才发现这里，关于这一段的说明在[这里](https://muyangmin.github.io/glide-docs-cn/doc/targets.html#%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88%E5%92%8C%E9%87%8D%E7%94%A8)。\n![](/images/glide官方文档截图Target.png)\n\n---\n第一个是因为缓存的问题卡住了，第二个是因为对象引用卡住了。以上就是关于这次的Glide踩坑记录，论官方文档全看完并理解的重要性。\n","slug":"Glide4的一次踩坑记录","published":1,"updated":"2019-11-05T10:16:51.978Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck9met64x000psltpyzx2un0n","content":"<p>如果你用图片加载库直接加载图片，并不需要做任何处理，那么，其实大多数时候你用任何加载库并没有太大的区别。一旦你需要处理各种各样的图片的时候，你就会遇到各种各样的问题了。这里记录一个关于Glide的问题，一下都是Glide4.9版本。<br><a id=\"more\"></a><br>在Glide中加载图片，可以很简单，类似于这样就可以了：<br><figure class=\"highlight java\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">Glide.with(context)</span><br><span class=\"line\">   .load(url)</span><br><span class=\"line\">   .into(imageView);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>但是，当你在加载图片之前对图片做处理，我们可以怎么做呢？比如我这样的需求，第一次显示的时候加载左边，点击之后加载右边，显然直接用Glide加载是不行的。下面介绍一些踩过的坑。<br><img src=\"/images/icon_spine_unselected_1.png\" alt></p>\n<h1 id=\"1-Transformation-变换\"><a href=\"#1-Transformation-变换\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.

WINTER\n\nShe woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.\n\nThe smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on the scent of prey.\n\nHalf-light filled the room, grey and gloomy. Shivering, she sat up in bed and ran a hand across her scalp. Stubble bristled against her palm. I need to shave before Izembaro sees. Mercy, I’m Mercy, and tonight I’ll be raped and murdered. Her true name was Mercedene, but Mercy was all anyone ever called her…\n<!--more-->\nExcept in dreams. She took a breath to quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of what she’d dreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it, though, and a full moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she ran.\n\nShe had fastened the shutters back so the morning sun might wake her. But there was no sun outside the window of Mercy’s little room, only a wall of shifting grey fog. The air had grown chilly… and a good thing, else she might have slept all day. It would be just like Mercy to sleep through her own rape.\n\nGooseprickles covered her legs. Her coverlet had twisted around her like a snake. She unwound it, threw the blanket to the bare plank floor and padded naked to the window. Braavos was lost in fog. She could see the green water of the little canal below, the cobbled stone street that ran beneath her building, two arches of the mossy bridge… but the far end of the bridge vanished in greyness, and of the buildings across the canal only a few vague lights remained. She heard a soft splash as a serpent boat emerged beneath the bridge’s central arch. “What hour?” Mercy called down to the man who stood by the snake’s uplifted tail, pushing her onward with his pole.\n\nThe waterman gazed up, searching for the voice. “Four, by the Titan’s roar.” His words echoed hollowly off the swirling green waters and the walls of unseen buildings.\n\nShe was not late, not yet, but she should not dawdle. Mercy was a happy soul and a hard worker, but seldom timely. That would not serve tonight. The envoy from Westeros was expected at the Gate this evening, and Izembaro would be in no mood to hear excuses, even if she served them up with a sweet smile.\n\nShe had filled her basin from the canal last night before she went to sleep, preferring the brackish water to the slimy green rainwater stewing in the cistern out back. Dipping a rough cloth, she washed herself head to heel, standing on one leg at a time to scrub her calloused feet. After that she found her razor. A bare scalp helped the wigs fit better, Izembaro claimed.\n\nShe shaved, donned her smallclothes, and slipped a shapeless brown wool dress down over her head. One of her stockings needed mending, she saw as she pulled it up. She would ask the Snapper for help; her own sewing was so wretched that the wardrobe mistress usually took pity on her. Else I could filtch a nicer pair from wardrobe. That was risky, though. Izembaro hated it when the mummers wore his costumes in the streets.Except for Wendeyne. Give Izembaro’s cock a little suck and a girl can wear any costume that she wants. Mercy was not so foolish as all that. Daena had warned her. “Girls who start down that road wind up on the Ship, where every man in the pit knows he can have any pretty thing he might see up on the stage, if his purse is plump enough.”\n\nHer boots were lumps of old brown leather mottled with saltstains and cracked from long wear, her belt a length of hempen rope dyed blue. She knotted it about her waist, and hung a knife on her right hip and a coin pouch on her left. Last of all she threw her cloak across her shoulders. It was a real mummer’s cloak, purple wool lined in red silk, with a hood to keep the rain off, and three secret pockets too. She’d hid some coins in one of those, an iron key in another, a blade in the last. A real blade, not a fruit knife like the one on her hip, but it did not belong to Mercy, no more than her other treasures did. The fruit knife belonged to Mercy. She was made for eating fruit, for smiling and joking, for working hard and doing as she was told.\n\n“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang as she descended the wooden stair to the street. The handrail was splintery, the steps steep, and there were five flights, but that was why she’d gotten the room so cheap. That, and Mercy’s smile. She might be bald and skinny, but Mercy had a pretty smile, and a certain grace. Even Izembaro agreed that she was graceful. She was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with feet instead of wings the way was longer. Braavos was a crooked city. The streets were crooked, the alleys were crookeder, and the canals were crookedest of all. Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the Ragman’s Road along the Outer Harbor, where she had the sea before her and the sky above, and a clear view across the Great Lagoon to the Arsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail her as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of tarry Ibbenese whalers and big-bellied Westerosi cogs. Mercy could not always understand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes she would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if they had the coin.\n\nThe long way also took her across the Bridge of Eyes with its carved stone faces. From the top of its span, she could look through the arches and see all the city: the green copper domes of the Hall of Truth, the masts rising like a forest from the Purple Harbor, the tall towers of the mighty, the golden thunderbolt turning on its spire atop the Sealord’s Palace… even the Titan’s bronze shoulders, off across the dark green waters. But that was only when the sun was shining down on Braavos. If the fog was thick there was nothing to see but grey, so today Mercy chose the shorter route to save some wear on her poor cracked boots.\n\nThe mists seemed to part before her and close up again as she passed. The cobblestones were wet and slick under her feet. She heard a cat yowl plaintively. Braavos was a good city for cats, and they roamed everywhere, especially at night. In the fog all cats are grey, Mercy thought. In the fog all men are killers.\n\nShe had never seen a thicker fog than this one. On the larger canals, the watermen would be running their serpent boats into one another, unable to make out any more than dim lights from the buildings to either side of them.\n\nMercy passed an old man with a lantern walking the other way, and envied him his light. The street was so gloomy she could scarcely see where she was stepping. In the humbler parts of the city, the houses, shops, and warehouses crowded together, leaning on each other like drunken lovers, their upper stories so close that you could step from one balcony to the next. The streets below became dark tunnels where every footfall echoed. The small canals were even more hazardous, since many of the houses that lined them had privies jutting out over the water. Izembaro loved to give the Sealord’s speech fromThe Merchant’s Melancholy Daughter, about how “here the last Titan yet stands, astride the stony shoulders of his brothers,” but Mercy preferred the scene where the fat merchant shat on the Sealord’s head as he passed underneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something like that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and sailor alike howl with laughter to see it.\n\nThe Gate stood close by the edge of Drowned Town, between the Outer Harbor and the Purple Harbor. An old warehouse had burnt there and the ground was sinking a little more each year, so the land came cheap. Atop the flooded stone foundation of the warehouse, Izembaro raised his cavernous playhall. The Dome and the Blue Lantern might enjoy more fashionable environs, he told his mummers, but here between the harbors they would never lack for sailors and whores to fill their pit. The Ship was close by, still pulling handsome crowds to the quay where she had been moored for twenty years, he said, and the Gate would flourish too.\n\nTime had proved him right. The Gate’s stage had developed a tilt as the building settled, their costumes were prone to mildew, and water snakes nested in the flooded cellar, but none of that troubled the mummers so long as the house was full.\n\nThe last bridge was made of rope and raw planks, and seemed to dissolve into nothingness, but that was only the fog. Mercy scampered across, her heels ringing on the wood. The fog opened before her like a tattered grey curtain to reveal the playhouse. Buttery yellow light spilled from the doors, and Mercy could hear voices from within. Beside the entrance, Big Brusco had painted over the title of the last show, and writtenThe Bloody Hand in its place in huge red letters. He was painting a bloody hand beneath the words, for those who could not read. Mercy stopped to have a look. “That’s a nice hand,” she told him.\n\n“Thumb’s crooked.” Brusco dabbed at it with his brush. “King o’ the Mummers been asking after you.”\n\n“It was so dark I slept and slept.” When Izembaro had first dubbed himself the King of the Mummers, the company had taken a wicked pleasure in it, savoring the outrage of their rivals from the Dome and the Blue Lantern. Of late, though, Izembaro had begun to take his title too seriously. “He will only play kings now,” Marro said, rolling his eyes, “and if the play has no king in it, he would sooner not stage it at all.”\n\nThe Bloody Hand offered two kings, the fat one and the boy. Izembaro would play the fat one. It was not a large part, but he had a fine speech as he lay dying, and a splendid fight with a demonic boar before that. Phario Forel had written it, and he had the bloodiest quill of all of Braavos.\n\nMercy found the company assembled behind the stage, and slipped in between Daena and the Snapper at the back, hoping her late arrival would go unnoticed. Izembaro was telling everyone that he expected the Gate to be packed to the rafters this evening, despite the fog. “The King of Westeros is sending his envoy to do homage to the King of the Mummers tonight,” he told his troupe. “We will not disappoint our fellow monarch.”\n\n“We?” said the Snapper, who did all the costumes for the mummers. “Is there more than one of him, now?”\n\n“He’s fat enough to count for two,” whispered Bobono. Every mummer’s troupe had to have a dwarf. He was theirs. When he saw Mercy, he gave her a leer. “Oho,” he said, “there she is. Is the little girl all ready for her rape?” He smacked his lips.\n\nThe Snapper smacked him in the head. “Be quiet.”\n\nThe King of the Mummers ignored the brief commotion. He was still talking, telling the mummers how magnificent they must be. Besides the Westerosi envoy, there would be keyholders in the crowd this evening, and famous courtesans as well. He did not intend for them to leave with a poor opinion of the Gate. “It shall go ill for any man who fails me,” he promised, a threat he borrowed from the speech Prince Garin gives on the eve of battle in Wroth of the Dragonlords, Phario Forel’s first play.\n\nBy the time Izembaro finally finished speaking, less than an hour remained before the show, and the mummers were all frantic and fretful by turns. The Gate rang to the sound of Mercy’s name.\n\n“Mercy,” her friend Daena implored, “Lady Stork has stepped on the hem of her gown again. Come help me sew it up.”\n\n“Mercy,” the Stranger called, “bring the bloody paste, my horn is coming loose.”\n\n“Mercy,” boomed Izembaro the Great himself, “what have you done with my crown, girl? I cannot make my entrance without my crown. How shall they know that I’m a king?”\n\n“Mercy,” squeaked the dwarf Bobono, “Mercy, something’s amiss with my laces, my cock keeps flopping out.”\n\nShe fetched the sticky paste and fastened the Stranger’s left horn back onto his forehead. She found Izembaro’s crown in the privy where he always left it and helped him pin it to his wig, and then ran for needle and thread so the Snapper could sew the lace hem back onto the cloth-of-gold gown that the queen would wear in the wedding scene.\n\nAnd Bobono’s cock was indeed flopping out. It was made to flop out, for the rape. What a hideous thing, Mercy thought as she knelt before the dwarf to fix him. The cock was a foot long and as thick as her arm, big enough to be seen from the highest balcony. The dyer had done a poor job with the leather, though; the thing was a mottled pink and white, with a bulbous head the color of a plum. Mercy pushed it back into Bobono’s breeches and laced him back up. “Mercy,” he sang as she tied him tight, “Mercy, Mercy, come to my room tonight and make a man of me.”\n\n“I’ll make a eunuch of you if you keep unlacing yourself just so I’ll fiddle with your crotch.”\n\n“We were meant to be together, Mercy,” Bobono insisted. “Look, we’re just the same height.”\n\n“Only when I’m on my knees. Do you remember your first line?” It had only been a fortnight since the dwarf had lurched onto stage in his cups and opened The Anguish of the Archon with the grumpkin’s speech from The Merchant’s Lusty Lady. Izembaro would skin him alive if he made such a blunder again, and never mind how hard it was to find a good dwarf.\n\n“What are we playing, Mercy?” Bobono asked innocently.\n\nHe is teasing me, Mercy thought. He’s not drunk tonight, he knows the show perfectly well. “We are doing Phario’s new Bloody Hand, in honor of the envoy from the Seven Kingdoms.”\n\n“Now I recall.” Bobono lowered his voice to a sinister croak. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he said. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude shape you see before you.” With that, he grabbed at her chest, fumbling for a nipple. “You have no titties. How can I rape a girl with no titties?”\n\nShe caught his nose between her thumb and forefinger and twisted. “You’ll have no nose until you get your hands off me.”\n\n“Owwwww,” the dwarf squealed, releasing her.\n\n“I’ll grow titties in a year or two.” Mercy rose, to tower over the little man. “But you’ll never grow another nose. You think of that, before you touch me there.”\n\nBobono rubbed his tender nose. “There’s no need to get so shy. I’ll be raping you soon enough.”\n\n“Not until the second act.”\n\n“I always give Wendeyne’s titties a nice squeeze when I rape her in The Anguish of the Archon,” the dwarf complained. “She likes it, and the pit does too. You have to please the pit.”\n\nThat was one of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” as he liked to call them. You have to please the pit. “I bet it would please the pit if I ripped off the dwarf’s cock and beat him about the head with it,” Mercy replied. “That’s something they won’t have seen before.” Always give them something they haven’t seen before was another of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” and one that Bobono had no easy answer for. “There, you’re done,” Mercy announced. “Now see if you can keep in your breeches till it’s needed.”\n\nIzembaro was calling for her again. Now he could not find his boar spear. Mercy found it for him, helped Big Brusco don his boar suit, checked the trick daggers just to make certain no one had replaced one with a real blade (someone had done that at the Dome once, and a mummer had died), and poured Lady Stork the little nip of wine she liked to have before each play. When all the cries of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” finally died away, she stole a moment for a quick peek out into the house.\n\nThe pit was as full as ever she’d seen it, and they were enjoying themselves already, joking and jostling, eating and drinking. She saw a peddler selling chunks of cheese, ripping them off the wheel with his fingers whenever he found a buyer. A woman had a bag of wrinkled apples. Skins of wine were being passed from hand to hand, some girls were selling kisses, and one sailor was playing the sea pipes. The sad-eyed little man called Quill stood in the back, come to see what he could steal for one of his own plays. Cossomo the Conjurer had come as well, and on his arm was Yna, the one-eyed whore from the Happy Port, but Mercy could not know those two, and they would not know Mercy. Daena recognized some Gate regulars in the crowd, and pointed them out for her; the dyer Dellono with his pinched white face and mottled purple hands, Galeo the sausage-maker in his greasy leather apron, tall Tomarro with his pet rat on his shoulder. “Tomarro best not let Galeo see that rat,” Daena warned. “That’s the only meat he puts in them sausages, I hear.” Mercy covered her mouth and laughed.\n\nThe balconies were filling too. The first and third levels were for merchants and captains and other respectable folk. The bravos preferred the fourth and highest, where the seats were cheapest. It was a riot of bright color up there, while down below more somber shades held sway. The second balcony was cut up into private boxes where the mighty could comport themselves in comfort and privacy, safely apart from the vulgarity above and below. They had the best view of the stage, and servants to bring them food, wine, cushions, whatever they might desire. It was rare to find the second balcony more than half full at the Gate; such of the mighty who relished a night of mummery were more inclined to visit the Dome or the Blue Lantern, where the offerings were considered subtler and more poetic.\n\nThis night was different, though, no doubt on account of the Westerosi envoy. In one box sat three scions of Otharys, each accompanied by a famous courtesan; Prestayn sat alone, a man so ancient that you wondered how he ever reached his seat; Torone and Pranelis shared a box, as they shared an uncomfortable alliance; the Third Sword was hosting a half-dozen friends.\n\n“I count five keyholders,” said Daena.\n\n“Bessaro is so fat you ought to count him twice,” Mercy replied, giggling. Izembaro had a belly on him, but compared to Bessaro he was as lithe as a willow. The keyholder was so big he needed a special seat, thrice the size of a common chair.\n\n“They’re all fat, them Reyaans,” Daena said. “Bellies as big as their ships. You should have seen the father. He made this one look small. One time he was summoned to the Hall of Truth to vote, but when he stepped onto his barge it sank.” She clutched Mercy by the elbow. “Look, the Sealord’s box.” The Sealord had never visited the Gate, but Izembaro named a box for him anyway, the largest and most opulent in the house. “That must be the Westerosi envoy. Have you ever seen such clothes on an old man? And look, he’s brought the Black Pearl!”\n\nThe envoy was slight and balding, with a funny grey wisp of a beard growing from his chin. His cloak was yellow velvet, and his breeches. His doublet was a blue so bright it almost made Mercy’s eyes water. Upon his breast a shield had been embroidered in yellow thread, and on the shield was a proud blue rooster picked out in lapis lazuli. One of his guards helped him to his seat, while two others stood behind him in the back of the box.\n\nThe woman with him could not have been more than a third his age. She was so lovely that the lamps seemed to burn brighter when she passed. She had dressed in a low-cut gown of pale yellow silk, startling against the light brown of her skin. Her black hair was bound up in a net of spun gold, and a jet-and-gold necklace brushed against the top of her full breasts. As they watched, she leaned close to the envoy and whispered something in his ear that made him laugh. “They should call her the Brown Pearl,” Mercy said to Daena. “She’s more brown than black.”\n\n“The first Black Pearl was black as a pot of ink,” said Daena. “She was a pirate queen, fathered by a Sealord’s son on a princess from the Summer Isles. A dragon king from Westeros took her for his lover.”\n\n“I would like to see a dragon,” Mercy said wistfully. “Why does the envoy have a chicken on his chest?”\n\nDaena howled. “Mercy, don’t you know anything? It’s his siggle. In the Sunset Kingdoms all the lords have siggles. Some have flowers, some have fish, some have bears and elks and other things. See, the envoy’s guards are wearing lions.”\n\nIt was true. There were four guards; big, hard-looking men in ringmail, with heavy Westerosi longswords sheathed at their hips. Their crimson cloaks were bordered in whorls of gold, and golden lions with red garnet eyes clasped each cloak at the shoulder. When Mercy glanced at the faces beneath the gilded, lion-crested helm, her belly gave a quiver.The gods have given me a gift. Her fingers clutched hard at Daena’s arm. “That guard. The one on the end, behind the Black Pearl.”\n\n“What of him? Do you know him?”\n\n“No.” Mercy had been born and bred in Braavos, how could she know some Westerosi? She had to think a moment. “It’s only… well, he’s fair to look on, don’t you think?” He was, in a rough-hewn way, though his eyes were hard.\n\nDaena shrugged. “He’s very old. Not so old as the other ones, but… he could be thirty. And Westerosi. They’re terrible savages, Mercy. Best stay well away from his sort.”\n\n“Stay away?” Mercy giggled. She was a giggly sort of girl, was Mercy. “No. I’ve got to get closer.” She gave Daena a squeeze and said, “If the Snapper comes looking for me, tell her that I went off to read my lines again.” She only had a few, and most were just, “Oh, no, no, no,” and “Don’t, oh don’t, don’t touch me,” and “Please, m’lord, I am still a maiden,” but this was the first time Izembaro had given her any lines at all, so it was only to be expected that poor Mercy would want to get them right.\n\nThe envoy from the Seven Kingdoms had taken two of his guards into his box to stand behind him and the Black Pearl, but the other two had been posted just outside the door to make certain he was not disturbed. They were talking quietly in the Common Tongue of Westeros as she slipped up silently behind them in the darkened passage. That was not a language Mercy knew.\n\n“Seven hells, this place is damp,” she heard her guard complain. “I’m chilled to the bones. Where are the bloody orange trees? I always heard there were orange trees in the Free Cities. Lemons and limes. Pomegranates. Hot peppers, warm nights, girls with bare bellies. Where are the bare-bellied girls, I ask you?”\n\n“Down in Lys, and Myr, and Old Volantis,” the other guard replied. He was an older man, big-bellied and grizzled. “I went to Lys with Lord Tywin once, when he was Hand to Aerys. Braavos is north of King’s Landing, fool. Can’t you read a bloody map?”\n\n“How long do you think we’ll be here?”\n\n“Longer than you’d like,” the old man replied. “If he goes back without the gold the queen will have his head. Besides, I seen that wife of his. There’s steps in Casterly Rock she can’t go down for fear she’d get stuck, that’s how fat she is. Who’d go back to that, when he has his sooty queen?”\n\nThe handsome guardsman grinned. “Don’t suppose he’ll share her with us, afterward?”\n\n“What, are you mad? You think he notices the likes of us? Bloody bugger don’t even get our names right half the time. Maybe it was different with Clegane.”\n\n“Ser wasn’t one for mummer shows and fancy whores. When Ser wanted a woman he took one, but sometimes he’d let us have her, after. I wouldn’t mind having a taste of that Black Pearl. You think she’s pink between her legs?”\n\nMercy wanted to hear more, but there was no time. The Bloody Hand was about to start, and the Snapper would be looking for her to help with costumes. Izembaro might be the King of the Mummers, but the Snapper was the one that they all feared. Time enough for her pretty guardsman later.\n\nThe Bloody Hand opened in a lichyard.\n\nWhen the dwarf appeared suddenly from behind a wooden tombstone, the crowd began to hiss and curse. Bobono waddled to the front of the stage and leered at them. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he began, snarling the words. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay… “\n\nBy then Marro had appeared behind him, gaunt and terrible in the Stranger’s long black robes. His face was black as well, his teeth red and shiny with blood, while ivory horns jutted upwards from his brow. Bobono could not see him, but the balconies could, and now the pit as well. The Gate grew deathly quiet. Marro moved forward silently.\n\nSo did Mercy. The costumes were all hung, and the Snapper was busy sewing Daena into her gown for the court scene, so Mercy’s absence should not be noted. Quiet as a shadow, she slipped around the back again, up to where the guardsmen stood outside the envoy’s box. Standing in a darkened alcove, still as stone, she had a good look at his face. She studied it carefully, to be sure. Am I too young for him? she wondered. Too plain? Too skinny? She hoped he wasn’t the sort of man who liked big breasts on a girl. Bobono had been right about her chest. It would be best if I could take him back to my place, have him all to myself. But will he come with me?\n\n“You think it might be him?” the pretty one was saying.\n\n“What, did the Others take your wits?”\n\n“Why not? He’s a dwarf, ain’t he?”\n\n“The Imp weren’t the only dwarf in the world.”\n\n“Maybe not, but look here, everyone says how clever he was, true? So maybe he figures the last place his sister would ever look for him would be in some mummer show, making fun of himself. So he does just that, to tweak her nose.”\n\n“Ah, you’re mad.”\n\n“Well, maybe I’ll follow him after the mummery. Find out for myself.” The guardsman put a hand on the hilt of his sword. “If I’m right, I’ll be a ma lord, and if I’m wrong, well, bleed it, it’s just some dwarf.” He gave a bark of laughter.\n\nOn stage, Bobono was bargaining with Marro’s sinister Stranger. He had a big voice for such a little man, and he made it ring off the highest rafters now. “Give me the cup,” he told the Stranger, “for I shall drink deep. And if it tastes of gold and lion’s blood, so much the better. As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them in fear in place of love.”\n\nMercy mouthed the last lines along with him. They were better lines than hers, and apt besides. He’ll want me or he won’t, she thought, so let the play begin. She said a silent prayer to the god of many faces, slipped out of her alcove, and flounced up to the guardsmen. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy. “My lords,” she said, “do you speak Braavosi? Oh, please, tell me you do.”\n\nThe two guardsmen exchanged a look. “What’s this thing going on about?” the older one asked. “Who is she?”\n\n“One of the mummers,” said the pretty one. He pushed his fair hair back off his brow and smiled at her. “Sorry, sweetling, we don’t speak your gibble-gabble.”\n\nFuss and feathers, Mercy thought, they only know the Common Tongue. That was no good. Give it up or go ahead. She could not give it up. She wanted him so bad. “I know your tongue, a little,” she lied, with Mercy’s sweetest smile. “You are lords of Westeros, my friend said.”\n\nThe old one laughed. “Lords? Aye, that’s us.”\n\nMercy looked down at her feet, so shy. “Izembaro said to please the lords,” she whispered. “If there is anything you want, anything at all… “\n\nThe two guardsmen exchanged a look. Then the handsome one reached out and touched her breast. “Anything?“\n\n“You’re disgusting,” said the older man.\n\n“Why? If this Izembaro wants to be hospitable, it would be rude to refuse.” He gave her nipple a tweak through the fabric of her dress, just the way the dwarf had done when she was fixing his cock for him. “Mummers are the next best thing to whores.”\n\n“Might be, but this one is a child.”\n\n“I am not,” lied Mercy. “I’m a maiden now.”\n\n“Not for long,” said the comely one. “I’m Lord Rafford, sweetling, and I know just what I want. Hike up those skirts now, and lean back against that wall.”\n\n“Not here,” Mercy said, brushing his hands away. “Not where the play is on. I might cry out, and Izembaro would be mad.”\n\n“Where, then?”\n\n“I know a place.”\n\nThe older guard was scowling. “What, you think can just scamper off? What if his knightliness comes looking for you?”\n\n“Why would he? He’s got a show to watch. And he’s got his own whore, why shouldn’t I have mine? This won’t take long.”\n\nNo, she thought, it won’t. Mercy took him by the hand, led him through the back and down the steps and out into the foggy night. “You could be a mummer, if you wanted,” she told him, as he pressed her up against the wall of the playhouse.\n\n“Me?” The guardsman snorted. “Not me, girl. All that bloody talking, I wouldn’t remember half of it.”\n\n“It’s hard at first,” she admitted. “But after a time it comes easier. I could teach you to say a line. I could.”\n\nHe grabbed her wrist. “I’ll do the teaching. Time for your first lesson.” He pulled her hard against him and kissed her on the lips, forcing his tongue into her mouth. It was all wet and slimy, like an eel. Mercy licked it with her own tongue, then broke away from him, breathless. “Not here. Someone might see. My room’s not far, but hurry. I have to be back before the second act, or I’ll miss my rape.”\n\nHe grinned. “No fear o’ that, girl.” But he let her pull him after her. Hand in hand, they went racing through the fog, over bridges and through alleys and up five flights of splintery wooden stairs. The guardsman was panting by the time they burst through the door of her little room. Mercy lit a tallow candle, then danced around at him, giggling. “Oh, now you’re all tired out. I forgot how old you were, m’lord. Do you want to take a little nap? Just lie down and close your eyes, and I’ll come back after the Imp’s done raping me.”\n\n“You’re not going anywhere.” He pulled her roughly to him. “Get those rags off, and I’ll show you how old I am, girl.”\n\n“Mercy,” she said. “My name is Mercy. Can you say it?”\n\n“Mercy,” he said. “My name is Raff.”\n\n“I know.” She slipped her hand between his legs, and felt how hard he was through the wool of his breeches.\n\n“The laces,” he urged her. “Be a sweet girl and undo them.” Instead she slid her finger down along the inside of his thigh. He gave a grunt. “Damn, be careful there, you — “\n\nMercy gave a gasp and stepped away, her face confused and frightened. “You’rebleeding.”\n\n“Wha — ” He looked down at himself. “Gods be good. What did you do to me, you little cunt?” The red stain spread across his thigh, soaking the heavy fabric.\n\n“Nothing,” Mercy squeaked. “I never… oh, oh, there’s so much blood. Stop it, stop it, you’re scaring me.”\n\nHe shook his head, a dazed look on his face. When he pressed his hand to his thigh, blood squirted through his fingers. It was running down his leg, into his boot. He doesn’t look so comely now, she thought. He just looks white and frightened.\n\n“A towel,” the guardsman gasped. “Bring me a towel, a rag, press down on it. Gods. I feel dizzy.” His leg was drenched with blood from the thigh down. When he tried to put his weight on it, his knee buckled and he fell. “Help me,” he pleaded, as the crotch of his breeches reddened. “Mother have mercy, girl. A healer… run and find a healer, quick now.”\n\n“There’s one on the next canal, but he won’t come. You have to go to him. Can’t you walk?”\n\n“Walk?” His fingers were slick with blood. “Are you blind, girl? I’m bleeding like a stuck pig. I can’t walk on this.”\n\n“Well,” she said, “I don’t know how you’ll get there, then.”\n\n“You’ll need to carry me.”\n\nSee? thought Mercy. You know your line, and so do I.\n\n“Think so?” asked Arya, sweetly.\n\nRaff the Sweetling looked up sharply as the long thin blade came sliding from her sleeve. She slipped it through his throat beneath the chin, twisted, and ripped it back out sideways with a single smooth slash. A fine red rain followed, and in his eyes the light went out.\n\n“Valar morghulis,” Arya whispered, but Raff was dead and did not hear. She sniffed. I should have helped him down the steps before I killed him. Now I’ll need to drag him all the way to the canal and roll him in. The eels would do the rest.\n\n“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang sadly. A foolish, giddy girl she’d been, but good hearted. She would miss her, and she would miss Daena and the Snapper and the rest, even Izembaro and Bobono. This would make trouble for the Sealord and the envoy with the chicken on his chest, she did not doubt.\n\nShe would think about that later, though. Just now, there was no time. I had best run. Mercy still had some lines to say, her first lines and her last, and Izembaro would have her pretty little empty head if she were late for her own rape.\n","source":"_posts/MERCY.md","raw":"---\ntitle: MERCY\ndate: 2016-04-06 20:51:57\ntags: 冰与火之歌\ncomments: false\n---\n\n## MERCYE\\--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\n\nShe woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.\n\nThe smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on the scent of prey.\n\nHalf-light filled the room, grey and gloomy. Shivering, she sat up in bed and ran a hand across her scalp. Stubble bristled against her palm. I need to shave before Izembaro sees. Mercy, I’m Mercy, and tonight I’ll be raped and murdered. Her true name was Mercedene, but Mercy was all anyone ever called her…\n<!--more-->\nExcept in dreams. She took a breath to quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of what she’d dreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it, though, and a full moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she ran.\n\nShe had fastened the shutters back so the morning sun might wake her. But there was no sun outside the window of Mercy’s little room, only a wall of shifting grey fog. The air had grown chilly… and a good thing, else she might have slept all day. It would be just like Mercy to sleep through her own rape.\n\nGooseprickles covered her legs. Her coverlet had twisted around her like a snake. She unwound it, threw the blanket to the bare plank floor and padded naked to the window. Braavos was lost in fog. She could see the green water of the little canal below, the cobbled stone street that ran beneath her building, two arches of the mossy bridge… but the far end of the bridge vanished in greyness, and of the buildings across the canal only a few vague lights remained. She heard a soft splash as a serpent boat emerged beneath the bridge’s central arch. “What hour?” Mercy called down to the man who stood by the snake’s uplifted tail, pushing her onward with his pole.\n\nThe waterman gazed up, searching for the voice. “Four, by the Titan’s roar.” His words echoed hollowly off the swirling green waters and the walls of unseen buildings.\n\nShe was not late, not yet, but she should not dawdle. Mercy was a happy soul and a hard worker, but seldom timely. That would not serve tonight. The envoy from Westeros was expected at the Gate this evening, and Izembaro would be in no mood to hear excuses, even if she served them up with a sweet smile.\n\nShe had filled her basin from the canal last night before she went to sleep, preferring the brackish water to the slimy green rainwater stewing in the cistern out back. Dipping a rough cloth, she washed herself head to heel, standing on one leg at a time to scrub her calloused feet. After that she found her razor. A bare scalp helped the wigs fit better, Izembaro claimed.\n\nShe shaved, donned her smallclothes, and slipped a shapeless brown wool dress down over her head. One of her stockings needed mending, she saw as she pulled it up. She would ask the Snapper for help; her own sewing was so wretched that the wardrobe mistress usually took pity on her. Else I could filtch a nicer pair from wardrobe. That was risky, though. Izembaro hated it when the mummers wore his costumes in the streets.Except for Wendeyne. Give Izembaro’s cock a little suck and a girl can wear any costume that she wants. Mercy was not so foolish as all that. Daena had warned her. “Girls who start down that road wind up on the Ship, where every man in the pit knows he can have any pretty thing he might see up on the stage, if his purse is plump enough.”\n\nHer boots were lumps of old brown leather mottled with saltstains and cracked from long wear, her belt a length of hempen rope dyed blue. She knotted it about her waist, and hung a knife on her right hip and a coin pouch on her left. Last of all she threw her cloak across her shoulders. It was a real mummer’s cloak, purple wool lined in red silk, with a hood to keep the rain off, and three secret pockets too. She’d hid some coins in one of those, an iron key in another, a blade in the last. A real blade, not a fruit knife like the one on her hip, but it did not belong to Mercy, no more than her other treasures did. The fruit knife belonged to Mercy. She was made for eating fruit, for smiling and joking, for working hard and doing as she was told.\n\n“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang as she descended the wooden stair to the street. The handrail was splintery, the steps steep, and there were five flights, but that was why she’d gotten the room so cheap. That, and Mercy’s smile. She might be bald and skinny, but Mercy had a pretty smile, and a certain grace. Even Izembaro agreed that she was graceful. She was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with feet instead of wings the way was longer. Braavos was a crooked city. The streets were crooked, the alleys were crookeder, and the canals were crookedest of all. Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the Ragman’s Road along the Outer Harbor, where she had the sea before her and the sky above, and a clear view across the Great Lagoon to the Arsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail her as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of tarry Ibbenese whalers and big-bellied Westerosi cogs. Mercy could not always understand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes she would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if they had the coin.\n\nThe long way also took her across the Bridge of Eyes with its carved stone faces. From the top of its span, she could look through the arches and see all the city: the green copper domes of the Hall of Truth, the masts rising like a forest from the Purple Harbor, the tall towers of the mighty, the golden thunderbolt turning on its spire atop the Sealord’s Palace… even the Titan’s bronze shoulders, off across the dark green waters. But that was only when the sun was shining down on Braavos. If the fog was thick there was nothing to see but grey, so today Mercy chose the shorter route to save some wear on her poor cracked boots.\n\nThe mists seemed to part before her and close up again as she passed. The cobblestones were wet and slick under her feet. She heard a cat yowl plaintively. Braavos was a good city for cats, and they roamed everywhere, especially at night. In the fog all cats are grey, Mercy thought. In the fog all men are killers.\n\nShe had never seen a thicker fog than this one. On the larger canals, the watermen would be running their serpent boats into one another, unable to make out any more than dim lights from the buildings to either side of them.\n\nMercy passed an old man with a lantern walking the other way, and envied him his light. The street was so gloomy she could scarcely see where she was stepping. In the humbler parts of the city, the houses, shops, and warehouses crowded together, leaning on each other like drunken lovers, their upper stories so close that you could step from one balcony to the next. The streets below became dark tunnels where every footfall echoed. The small canals were even more hazardous, since many of the houses that lined them had privies jutting out over the water. Izembaro loved to give the Sealord’s speech fromThe Merchant’s Melancholy Daughter, about how “here the last Titan yet stands, astride the stony shoulders of his brothers,” but Mercy preferred the scene where the fat merchant shat on the Sealord’s head as he passed underneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something like that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and sailor alike howl with laughter to see it.\n\nThe Gate stood close by the edge of Drowned Town, between the Outer Harbor and the Purple Harbor. An old warehouse had burnt there and the ground was sinking a little more each year, so the land came cheap. Atop the flooded stone foundation of the warehouse, Izembaro raised his cavernous playhall. The Dome and the Blue Lantern might enjoy more fashionable environs, he told his mummers, but here between the harbors they would never lack for sailors and whores to fill their pit. The Ship was close by, still pulling handsome crowds to the quay where she had been moored for twenty years, he said, and the Gate would flourish too.\n\nTime had proved him right. The Gate’s stage had developed a tilt as the building settled, their costumes were prone to mildew, and water snakes nested in the flooded cellar, but none of that troubled the mummers so long as the house was full.\n\nThe last bridge was made of rope and raw planks, and seemed to dissolve into nothingness, but that was only the fog. Mercy scampered across, her heels ringing on the wood. The fog opened before her like a tattered grey curtain to reveal the playhouse. Buttery yellow light spilled from the doors, and Mercy could hear voices from within. Beside the entrance, Big Brusco had painted over the title of the last show, and writtenThe Bloody Hand in its place in huge red letters. He was painting a bloody hand beneath the words, for those who could not read. Mercy stopped to have a look. “That’s a nice hand,” she told him.\n\n“Thumb’s crooked.” Brusco dabbed at it with his brush. “King o’ the Mummers been asking after you.”\n\n“It was so dark I slept and slept.” When Izembaro had first dubbed himself the King of the Mummers, the company had taken a wicked pleasure in it, savoring the outrage of their rivals from the Dome and the Blue Lantern. Of late, though, Izembaro had begun to take his title too seriously. “He will only play kings now,” Marro said, rolling his eyes, “and if the play has no king in it, he would sooner not stage it at all.”\n\nThe Bloody Hand offered two kings, the fat one and the boy. Izembaro would play the fat one. It was not a large part, but he had a fine speech as he lay dying, and a splendid fight with a demonic boar before that. Phario Forel had written it, and he had the bloodiest quill of all of Braavos.\n\nMercy found the company assembled behind the stage, and slipped in between Daena and the Snapper at the back, hoping her late arrival would go unnoticed. Izembaro was telling everyone that he expected the Gate to be packed to the rafters this evening, despite the fog. “The King of Westeros is sending his envoy to do homage to the King of the Mummers tonight,” he told his troupe. “We will not disappoint our fellow monarch.”\n\n“We?” said the Snapper, who did all the costumes for the mummers. “Is there more than one of him, now?”\n\n“He’s fat enough to count for two,” whispered Bobono. Every mummer’s troupe had to have a dwarf. He was theirs. When he saw Mercy, he gave her a leer. “Oho,” he said, “there she is. Is the little girl all ready for her rape?” He smacked his lips.\n\nThe Snapper smacked him in the head. “Be quiet.”\n\nThe King of the Mummers ignored the brief commotion. He was still talking, telling the mummers how magnificent they must be. Besides the Westerosi envoy, there would be keyholders in the crowd this evening, and famous courtesans as well. He did not intend for them to leave with a poor opinion of the Gate. “It shall go ill for any man who fails me,” he promised, a threat he borrowed from the speech Prince Garin gives on the eve of battle in Wroth of the Dragonlords, Phario Forel’s first play.\n\nBy the time Izembaro finally finished speaking, less than an hour remained before the show, and the mummers were all frantic and fretful by turns. The Gate rang to the sound of Mercy’s name.\n\n“Mercy,” her friend Daena implored, “Lady Stork has stepped on the hem of her gown again. Come help me sew it up.”\n\n“Mercy,” the Stranger called, “bring the bloody paste, my horn is coming loose.”\n\n“Mercy,” boomed Izembaro the Great himself, “what have you done with my crown, girl? I cannot make my entrance without my crown. How shall they know that I’m a king?”\n\n“Mercy,” squeaked the dwarf Bobono, “Mercy, something’s amiss with my laces, my cock keeps flopping out.”\n\nShe fetched the sticky paste and fastened the Stranger’s left horn back onto his forehead. She found Izembaro’s crown in the privy where he always left it and helped him pin it to his wig, and then ran for needle and thread so the Snapper could sew the lace hem back onto the cloth-of-gold gown that the queen would wear in the wedding scene.\n\nAnd Bobono’s cock was indeed flopping out. It was made to flop out, for the rape. What a hideous thing, Mercy thought as she knelt before the dwarf to fix him. The cock was a foot long and as thick as her arm, big enough to be seen from the highest balcony. The dyer had done a poor job with the leather, though; the thing was a mottled pink and white, with a bulbous head the color of a plum. Mercy pushed it back into Bobono’s breeches and laced him back up. “Mercy,” he sang as she tied him tight, “Mercy, Mercy, come to my room tonight and make a man of me.”\n\n“I’ll make a eunuch of you if you keep unlacing yourself just so I’ll fiddle with your crotch.”\n\n“We were meant to be together, Mercy,” Bobono insisted. “Look, we’re just the same height.”\n\n“Only when I’m on my knees. Do you remember your first line?” It had only been a fortnight since the dwarf had lurched onto stage in his cups and opened The Anguish of the Archon with the grumpkin’s speech from The Merchant’s Lusty Lady. Izembaro would skin him alive if he made such a blunder again, and never mind how hard it was to find a good dwarf.\n\n“What are we playing, Mercy?” Bobono asked innocently.\n\nHe is teasing me, Mercy thought. He’s not drunk tonight, he knows the show perfectly well. “We are doing Phario’s new Bloody Hand, in honor of the envoy from the Seven Kingdoms.”\n\n“Now I recall.” Bobono lowered his voice to a sinister croak. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he said. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude shape you see before you.” With that, he grabbed at her chest, fumbling for a nipple. “You have no titties. How can I rape a girl with no titties?”\n\nShe caught his nose between her thumb and forefinger and twisted. “You’ll have no nose until you get your hands off me.”\n\n“Owwwww,” the dwarf squealed, releasing her.\n\n“I’ll grow titties in a year or two.” Mercy rose, to tower over the little man. “But you’ll never grow another nose. You think of that, before you touch me there.”\n\nBobono rubbed his tender nose. “There’s no need to get so shy. I’ll be raping you soon enough.”\n\n“Not until the second act.”\n\n“I always give Wendeyne’s titties a nice squeeze when I rape her in The Anguish of the Archon,” the dwarf complained. “She likes it, and the pit does too. You have to please the pit.”\n\nThat was one of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” as he liked to call them. You have to please the pit. “I bet it would please the pit if I ripped off the dwarf’s cock and beat him about the head with it,” Mercy replied. “That’s something they won’t have seen before.” Always give them something they haven’t seen before was another of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” and one that Bobono had no easy answer for. “There, you’re done,” Mercy announced. “Now see if you can keep in your breeches till it’s needed.”\n\nIzembaro was calling for her again. Now he could not find his boar spear. Mercy found it for him, helped Big Brusco don his boar suit, checked the trick daggers just to make certain no one had replaced one with a real blade (someone had done that at the Dome once, and a mummer had died), and poured Lady Stork the little nip of wine she liked to have before each play. When all the cries of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” finally died away, she stole a moment for a quick peek out into the house.\n\nThe pit was as full as ever she’d seen it, and they were enjoying themselves already, joking and jostling, eating and drinking. She saw a peddler selling chunks of cheese, ripping them off the wheel with his fingers whenever he found a buyer. A woman had a bag of wrinkled apples. Skins of wine were being passed from hand to hand, some girls were selling kisses, and one sailor was playing the sea pipes. The sad-eyed little man called Quill stood in the back, come to see what he could steal for one of his own plays. Cossomo the Conjurer had come as well, and on his arm was Yna, the one-eyed whore from the Happy Port, but Mercy could not know those two, and they would not know Mercy. Daena recognized some Gate regulars in the crowd, and pointed them out for her; the dyer Dellono with his pinched white face and mottled purple hands, Galeo the sausage-maker in his greasy leather apron, tall Tomarro with his pet rat on his shoulder. “Tomarro best not let Galeo see that rat,” Daena warned. “That’s the only meat he puts in them sausages, I hear.” Mercy covered her mouth and laughed.\n\nThe balconies were filling too. The first and third levels were for merchants and captains and other respectable folk. The bravos preferred the fourth and highest, where the seats were cheapest. It was a riot of bright color up there, while down below more somber shades held sway. The second balcony was cut up into private boxes where the mighty could comport themselves in comfort and privacy, safely apart from the vulgarity above and below. They had the best view of the stage, and servants to bring them food, wine, cushions, whatever they might desire. It was rare to find the second balcony more than half full at the Gate; such of the mighty who relished a night of mummery were more inclined to visit the Dome or the Blue Lantern, where the offerings were considered subtler and more poetic.\n\nThis night was different, though, no doubt on account of the Westerosi envoy. In one box sat three scions of Otharys, each accompanied by a famous courtesan; Prestayn sat alone, a man so ancient that you wondered how he ever reached his seat; Torone and Pranelis shared a box, as they shared an uncomfortable alliance; the Third Sword was hosting a half-dozen friends.\n\n“I count five keyholders,” said Daena.\n\n“Bessaro is so fat you ought to count him twice,” Mercy replied, giggling. Izembaro had a belly on him, but compared to Bessaro he was as lithe as a willow. The keyholder was so big he needed a special seat, thrice the size of a common chair.\n\n“They’re all fat, them Reyaans,” Daena said. “Bellies as big as their ships. You should have seen the father. He made this one look small. One time he was summoned to the Hall of Truth to vote, but when he stepped onto his barge it sank.” She clutched Mercy by the elbow. “Look, the Sealord’s box.” The Sealord had never visited the Gate, but Izembaro named a box for him anyway, the largest and most opulent in the house. “That must be the Westerosi envoy. Have you ever seen such clothes on an old man? And look, he’s brought the Black Pearl!”\n\nThe envoy was slight and balding, with a funny grey wisp of a beard growing from his chin. His cloak was yellow velvet, and his breeches. His doublet was a blue so bright it almost made Mercy’s eyes water. Upon his breast a shield had been embroidered in yellow thread, and on the shield was a proud blue rooster picked out in lapis lazuli. One of his guards helped him to his seat, while two others stood behind him in the back of the box.\n\nThe woman with him could not have been more than a third his age. She was so lovely that the lamps seemed to burn brighter when she passed. She had dressed in a low-cut gown of pale yellow silk, startling against the light brown of her skin. Her black hair was bound up in a net of spun gold, and a jet-and-gold necklace brushed against the top of her full breasts. As they watched, she leaned close to the envoy and whispered something in his ear that made him laugh. “They should call her the Brown Pearl,” Mercy said to Daena. “She’s more brown than black.”\n\n“The first Black Pearl was black as a pot of ink,” said Daena. “She was a pirate queen, fathered by a Sealord’s son on a princess from the Summer Isles. A dragon king from Westeros took her for his lover.”\n\n“I would like to see a dragon,” Mercy said wistfully. “Why does the envoy have a chicken on his chest?”\n\nDaena howled. “Mercy, don’t you know anything? It’s his siggle. In the Sunset Kingdoms all the lords have siggles. Some have flowers, some have fish, some have bears and elks and other things. See, the envoy’s guards are wearing lions.”\n\nIt was true. There were four guards; big, hard-looking men in ringmail, with heavy Westerosi longswords sheathed at their hips. Their crimson cloaks were bordered in whorls of gold, and golden lions with red garnet eyes clasped each cloak at the shoulder. When Mercy glanced at the faces beneath the gilded, lion-crested helm, her belly gave a quiver.The gods have given me a gift. Her fingers clutched hard at Daena’s arm. “That guard. The one on the end, behind the Black Pearl.”\n\n“What of him? Do you know him?”\n\n“No.” Mercy had been born and bred in Braavos, how could she know some Westerosi? She had to think a moment. “It’s only… well, he’s fair to look on, don’t you think?” He was, in a rough-hewn way, though his eyes were hard.\n\nDaena shrugged. “He’s very old. Not so old as the other ones, but… he could be thirty. And Westerosi. They’re terrible savages, Mercy. Best stay well away from his sort.”\n\n“Stay away?” Mercy giggled. She was a giggly sort of girl, was Mercy. “No. I’ve got to get closer.” She gave Daena a squeeze and said, “If the Snapper comes looking for me, tell her that I went off to read my lines again.” She only had a few, and most were just, “Oh, no, no, no,” and “Don’t, oh don’t, don’t touch me,” and “Please, m’lord, I am still a maiden,” but this was the first time Izembaro had given her any lines at all, so it was only to be expected that poor Mercy would want to get them right.\n\nThe envoy from the Seven Kingdoms had taken two of his guards into his box to stand behind him and the Black Pearl, but the other two had been posted just outside the door to make certain he was not disturbed. They were talking quietly in the Common Tongue of Westeros as she slipped up silently behind them in the darkened passage. That was not a language Mercy knew.\n\n“Seven hells, this place is damp,” she heard her guard complain. “I’m chilled to the bones. Where are the bloody orange trees? I always heard there were orange trees in the Free Cities. Lemons and limes. Pomegranates. Hot peppers, warm nights, girls with bare bellies. Where are the bare-bellied girls, I ask you?”\n\n“Down in Lys, and Myr, and Old Volantis,” the other guard replied. He was an older man, big-bellied and grizzled. “I went to Lys with Lord Tywin once, when he was Hand to Aerys. Braavos is north of King’s Landing, fool. Can’t you read a bloody map?”\n\n“How long do you think we’ll be here?”\n\n“Longer than you’d like,” the old man replied. “If he goes back without the gold the queen will have his head. Besides, I seen that wife of his. There’s steps in Casterly Rock she can’t go down for fear she’d get stuck, that’s how fat she is. Who’d go back to that, when he has his sooty queen?”\n\nThe handsome guardsman grinned. “Don’t suppose he’ll share her with us, afterward?”\n\n“What, are you mad? You think he notices the likes of us? Bloody bugger don’t even get our names right half the time. Maybe it was different with Clegane.”\n\n“Ser wasn’t one for mummer shows and fancy whores. When Ser wanted a woman he took one, but sometimes he’d let us have her, after. I wouldn’t mind having a taste of that Black Pearl. You think she’s pink between her legs?”\n\nMercy wanted to hear more, but there was no time. The Bloody Hand was about to start, and the Snapper would be looking for her to help with costumes. Izembaro might be the King of the Mummers, but the Snapper was the one that they all feared. Time enough for her pretty guardsman later.\n\nThe Bloody Hand opened in a lichyard.\n\nWhen the dwarf appeared suddenly from behind a wooden tombstone, the crowd began to hiss and curse. Bobono waddled to the front of the stage and leered at them. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he began, snarling the words. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay… “\n\nBy then Marro had appeared behind him, gaunt and terrible in the Stranger’s long black robes. His face was black as well, his teeth red and shiny with blood, while ivory horns jutted upwards from his brow. Bobono could not see him, but the balconies could, and now the pit as well. The Gate grew deathly quiet. Marro moved forward silently.\n\nSo did Mercy. The costumes were all hung, and the Snapper was busy sewing Daena into her gown for the court scene, so Mercy’s absence should not be noted. Quiet as a shadow, she slipped around the back again, up to where the guardsmen stood outside the envoy’s box. Standing in a darkened alcove, still as stone, she had a good look at his face. She studied it carefully, to be sure. Am I too young for him? she wondered. Too plain? Too skinny? She hoped he wasn’t the sort of man who liked big breasts on a girl. Bobono had been right about her chest. It would be best if I could take him back to my place, have him all to myself. But will he come with me?\n\n“You think it might be him?” the pretty one was saying.\n\n“What, did the Others take your wits?”\n\n“Why not? He’s a dwarf, ain’t he?”\n\n“The Imp weren’t the only dwarf in the world.”\n\n“Maybe not, but look here, everyone says how clever he was, true? So maybe he figures the last place his sister would ever look for him would be in some mummer show, making fun of himself. So he does just that, to tweak her nose.”\n\n“Ah, you’re mad.”\n\n“Well, maybe I’ll follow him after the mummery. Find out for myself.” The guardsman put a hand on the hilt of his sword. “If I’m right, I’ll be a ma lord, and if I’m wrong, well, bleed it, it’s just some dwarf.” He gave a bark of laughter.\n\nOn stage, Bobono was bargaining with Marro’s sinister Stranger. He had a big voice for such a little man, and he made it ring off the highest rafters now. “Give me the cup,” he told the Stranger, “for I shall drink deep. And if it tastes of gold and lion’s blood, so much the better. As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them in fear in place of love.”\n\nMercy mouthed the last lines along with him. They were better lines than hers, and apt besides. He’ll want me or he won’t, she thought, so let the play begin. She said a silent prayer to the god of many faces, slipped out of her alcove, and flounced up to the guardsmen. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy. “My lords,” she said, “do you speak Braavosi? Oh, please, tell me you do.”\n\nThe two guardsmen exchanged a look. “What’s this thing going on about?” the older one asked. “Who is she?”\n\n“One of the mummers,” said the pretty one. He pushed his fair hair back off his brow and smiled at her. “Sorry, sweetling, we don’t speak your gibble-gabble.”\n\nFuss and feathers, Mercy thought, they only know the Common Tongue. That was no good. Give it up or go ahead. She could not give it up. She wanted him so bad. “I know your tongue, a little,” she lied, with Mercy’s sweetest smile. “You are lords of Westeros, my friend said.”\n\nThe old one laughed. “Lords? Aye, that’s us.”\n\nMercy looked down at her feet, so shy. “Izembaro said to please the lords,” she whispered. “If there is anything you want, anything at all… “\n\nThe two guardsmen exchanged a look. Then the handsome one reached out and touched her breast. “Anything?“\n\n“You’re disgusting,” said the older man.\n\n“Why? If this Izembaro wants to be hospitable, it would be rude to refuse.” He gave her nipple a tweak through the fabric of her dress, just the way the dwarf had done when she was fixing his cock for him. “Mummers are the next best thing to whores.”\n\n“Might be, but this one is a child.”\n\n“I am not,” lied Mercy. “I’m a maiden now.”\n\n“Not for long,” said the comely one. “I’m Lord Rafford, sweetling, and I know just what I want. Hike up those skirts now, and lean back against that wall.”\n\n“Not here,” Mercy said, brushing his hands away. “Not where the play is on. I might cry out, and Izembaro would be mad.”\n\n“Where, then?”\n\n“I know a place.”\n\nThe older guard was scowling. “What, you think can just scamper off? What if his knightliness comes looking for you?”\n\n“Why would he? He’s got a show to watch. And he’s got his own whore, why shouldn’t I have mine? This won’t take long.”\n\nNo, she thought, it won’t. Mercy took him by the hand, led him through the back and down the steps and out into the foggy night. “You could be a mummer, if you wanted,” she told him, as he pressed her up against the wall of the playhouse.\n\n“Me?” The guardsman snorted. “Not me, girl. All that bloody talking, I wouldn’t remember half of it.”\n\n“It’s hard at first,” she admitted. “But after a time it comes easier. I could teach you to say a line. I could.”\n\nHe grabbed her wrist. “I’ll do the teaching. Time for your first lesson.” He pulled her hard against him and kissed her on the lips, forcing his tongue into her mouth. It was all wet and slimy, like an eel. Mercy licked it with her own tongue, then broke away from him, breathless. “Not here. Someone might see. My room’s not far, but hurry. I have to be back before the second act, or I’ll miss my rape.”\n\nHe grinned. “No fear o’ that, girl.” But he let her pull him after her. Hand in hand, they went racing through the fog, over bridges and through alleys and up five flights of splintery wooden stairs. The guardsman was panting by the time they burst through the door of her little room. Mercy lit a tallow candle, then danced around at him, giggling. “Oh, now you’re all tired out. I forgot how old you were, m’lord. Do you want to take a little nap? Just lie down and close your eyes, and I’ll come back after the Imp’s done raping me.”\n\n“You’re not going anywhere.” He pulled her roughly to him. “Get those rags off, and I’ll show you how old I am, girl.”\n\n“Mercy,” she said. “My name is Mercy. Can you say it?”\n\n“Mercy,” he said. “My name is Raff.”\n\n“I know.” She slipped her hand between his legs, and felt how hard he was through the wool of his breeches.\n\n“The laces,” he urged her. “Be a sweet girl and undo them.” Instead she slid her finger down along the inside of his thigh. He gave a grunt. “Damn, be careful there, you — “\n\nMercy gave a gasp and stepped away, her face confused and frightened. “You’rebleeding.”\n\n“Wha — ” He looked down at himself. “Gods be good. What did you do to me, you little cunt?” The red stain spread across his thigh, soaking the heavy fabric.\n\n“Nothing,” Mercy squeaked. “I never… oh, oh, there’s so much blood. Stop it, stop it, you’re scaring me.”\n\nHe shook his head, a dazed look on his face. When he pressed his hand to his thigh, blood squirted through his fingers. It was running down his leg, into his boot. He doesn’t look so comely now, she thought. He just looks white and frightened.\n\n“A towel,” the guardsman gasped. “Bring me a towel, a rag, press down on it. Gods. I feel dizzy.” His leg was drenched with blood from the thigh down. When he tried to put his weight on it, his knee buckled and he fell. “Help me,” he pleaded, as the crotch of his breeches reddened. “Mother have mercy, girl. A healer… run and find a healer, quick now.”\n\n“There’s one on the next canal, but he won’t come. You have to go to him. Can’t you walk?”\n\n“Walk?” His fingers were slick with blood. “Are you blind, girl? I’m bleeding like a stuck pig. I can’t walk on this.”\n\n“Well,” she said, “I don’t know how you’ll get there, then.”\n\n“You’ll need to carry me.”\n\nSee? thought Mercy. You know your line, and so do I.\n\n“Think so?” asked Arya, sweetly.\n\nRaff the Sweetling looked up sharply as the long thin blade came sliding from her sleeve. She slipped it through his throat beneath the chin, twisted, and ripped it back out sideways with a single smooth slash. A fine red rain followed, and in his eyes the light went out.\n\n“Valar morghulis,” Arya whispered, but Raff was dead and did not hear. She sniffed. I should have helped him down the steps before I killed him. Now I’ll need to drag him all the way to the canal and roll him in. The eels would do the rest.\n\n“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang sadly. A foolish, giddy girl she’d been, but good hearted. She would miss her, and she would miss Daena and the Snapper and the rest, even Izembaro and Bobono. This would make trouble for the Sealord and the envoy with the chicken on his chest, she did not doubt.\n\nShe would think about that later, though. Just now, there was no time. I had best run. Mercy still had some lines to say, her first lines and her last, and Izembaro would have her pretty little empty head if she were late for her own rape.\n","slug":"MERCY","published":1,"updated":"2017-04-15T14:05:50.000Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck9met651000ssltpkyl7zufu","content":"<h2 id=\"MERCYE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\"><a href=\"#MERCYE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"MERCYE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\"></a>MERCYE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER</h2><p>She woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.</p>\n<p>The smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on the scent of prey.</p>\n<p>Half-light filled the room, grey and gloomy. Shivering, she sat up in bed and ran a hand across her scalp. Stubble bristled against her palm. I need to shave before Izembaro sees. Mercy, I’m Mercy, and tonight I’ll be raped and murdered. Her true name was Mercedene, but Mercy was all anyone ever called her…<br><a id=\"more\"></a><br>Except in dreams. She took a breath to quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of what she’d dreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it, though, and a full moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she ran.</p>\n<p>She had fastened the shutters back so the morning sun might wake her. But there was no sun outside the window of Mercy’s little room, only a wall of shifting grey fog. The air had grown chilly… and a good thing, else she might have slept all day. It would be just like Mercy to sleep through her own rape.</p>\n<p>Gooseprickles covered her legs. Her coverlet had twisted around her like a snake. She unwound it, threw the blanket to the bare plank floor and padded naked to the window. Braavos was lost in fog. She could see the green water of the little canal below, the cobbled stone street that ran beneath her building, two arches of the mossy bridge… but the far end of the bridge vanished in greyness, and of the buildings across the canal only a few vague lights remained. She heard a soft splash as a serpent boat emerged beneath the bridge’s central arch. “What hour?” Mercy called down to the man who stood by the snake’s uplifted tail, pushing her onward with his pole.</p>\n<p>The waterman gazed up, searching for the voice. “Four, by the Titan’s roar.” His words echoed hollowly off the swirling green waters and the walls of unseen buildings.</p>\n<p>She was not late, not yet, but she should not dawdle. Mercy was a happy soul and a hard worker, but seldom timely. That would not serve tonight. The envoy from Westeros was expected at the Gate this evening, and Izembaro would be in no mood to hear excuses, even if she served them up with a sweet smile.</p>\n<p>She had filled her basin from the canal last night before she went to sleep, preferring the brackish water to the slimy green rainwater stewing in the cistern out back. Dipping a rough cloth, she washed herself head to heel, standing on one leg at a time to scrub her calloused feet. After that she found her razor. A bare scalp helped the wigs fit better, Izembaro claimed.</p>\n<p>She shaved, donned her smallclothes, and slipped a shapeless brown wool dress down over her head. One of her stockings needed mending, she saw as she pulled it up. She would ask the Snapper for help; her own sewing was so wretched that the wardrobe mistress usually took pity on her. Else I could filtch a nicer pair from wardrobe. That was risky, though. Izembaro hated it when the mummers wore his costumes in the streets.Except for Wendeyne. Give Izembaro’s cock a little suck and a girl can wear any costume that she wants. Mercy was not so foolish as all that. Daena had warned her. “Girls who start down that road wind up on the Ship, where every man in the pit knows he can have any pretty thing he might see up on the stage, if his purse is plump enough.”</p>\n<p>Her boots were lumps of old brown leather mottled with saltstains and cracked from long wear, her belt a length of hempen rope dyed blue. She knotted it about her waist, and hung a knife on her right hip and a coin pouch on her left. Last of all she threw her cloak across her shoulders. It was a real mummer’s cloak, purple wool lined in red silk, with a hood to keep the rain off, and three secret pockets too. She’d hid some coins in one of those, an iron key in another, a blade in the last. A real blade, not a fruit knife like the one on her hip, but it did not belong to Mercy, no more than her other treasures did. The fruit knife belonged to Mercy. She was made for eating fruit, for smiling and joking, for working hard and doing as she was told.</p>\n<p>“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang as she descended the wooden stair to the street. The handrail was splintery, the steps steep, and there were five flights, but that was why she’d gotten the room so cheap. That, and Mercy’s smile. She might be bald and skinny, but Mercy had a pretty smile, and a certain grace. Even Izembaro agreed that she was graceful. She was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with feet instead of wings the way was longer. Braavos was a crooked city. The streets were crooked, the alleys were crookeder, and the canals were crookedest of all. Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the Ragman’s Road along the Outer Harbor, where she had the sea before her and the sky above, and a clear view across the Great Lagoon to the Arsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail her as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of tarry Ibbenese whalers and big-bellied Westerosi cogs. Mercy could not always understand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes she would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if they had the coin.</p>\n<p>The long way also took her across the Bridge of Eyes with its carved stone faces. From the top of its span, she could look through the arches and see all the city: the green copper domes of the Hall of Truth, the masts rising like a forest from the Purple Harbor, the tall towers of the mighty, the golden thunderbolt turning on its spire atop the Sealord’s Palace… even the Titan’s bronze shoulders, off across the dark green waters. But that was only when the sun was shining down on Braavos. If the fog was thick there was nothing to see but grey, so today Mercy chose the shorter route to save some wear on her poor cracked boots.</p>\n<p>The mists seemed to part before her and close up again as she passed. The cobblestones were wet and slick under her feet. She heard a cat yowl plaintively. Braavos was a good city for cats, and they roamed everywhere, especially at night. In the fog all cats are grey, Mercy thought. In the fog all men are killers.</p>\n<p>She had never seen a thicker fog than this one. On the larger canals, the watermen would be running their serpent boats into one another, unable to make out any more than dim lights from the buildings to either side of them.</p>\n<p>Mercy passed an old man with a lantern walking the other way, and envied him his light. The street was so gloomy she could scarcely see where she was stepping. In the humbler parts of the city, the houses, shops, and warehouses crowded together, leaning on each other like drunken lovers, their upper stories so close that you could step from one balcony to the next. The streets below became dark tunnels where every footfall echoed. The small canals were even more hazardous, since many of the houses that lined them had privies jutting out over the water. Izembaro loved to give the Sealord’s speech fromThe Merchant’s Melancholy Daughter, about how “here the last Titan yet stands, astride the stony shoulders of his brothers,” but Mercy preferred the scene where the fat merchant shat on the Sealord’s head as he passed underneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something like that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and sailor alike howl with laughter to see it.</p>\n<p>The Gate stood close by the edge of Drowned Town, between the Outer Harbor and the Purple Harbor. An old warehouse had burnt there and the ground was sinking a little more each year, so the land came cheap. Atop the flooded stone foundation of the warehouse, Izembaro raised his cavernous playhall. The Dome and the Blue Lantern might enjoy more fashionable environs, he told his mummers, but here between the harbors they would never lack for sailors and whores to fill their pit. The Ship was close by, still pulling handsome crowds to the quay where she had been moored for twenty years, he said, and the Gate would flourish too.</p>\n<p>Time had proved him right. The Gate’s stage had developed a tilt as the building settled, their costumes were prone to mildew, and water snakes nested in the flooded cellar, but none of that troubled the mummers so long as the house was full.</p>\n<p>The last bridge was made of rope and raw planks, and seemed to dissolve into nothingness, but that was only the fog. Mercy scampered across, her heels ringing on the wood. The fog opened before her like a tattered grey curtain to reveal the playhouse. Buttery yellow light spilled from the doors, and Mercy could hear voices from within. Beside the entrance, Big Brusco had painted over the title of the last show, and writtenThe Bloody Hand in its place in huge red letters. He was painting a bloody hand beneath the words, for those who could not read. Mercy stopped to have a look. “That’s a nice hand,” she told him.</p>\n<p>“Thumb’s crooked.” Brusco dabbed at it with his brush. “King o’ the Mummers been asking after you.”</p>\n<p>“It was so dark I slept and slept.” When Izembaro had first dubbed himself the King of the Mummers, the company had taken a wicked pleasure in it, savoring the outrage of their rivals from the Dome and the Blue Lantern. Of late, though, Izembaro had begun to take his title too seriously. “He will only play kings now,” Marro said, rolling his eyes, “and if the play has no king in it, he would sooner not stage it at all.”</p>\n<p>The Bloody Hand offered two kings, the fat one and the boy. Izembaro would play the fat one. It was not a large part, but he had a fine speech as he lay dying, and a splendid fight with a demonic boar before that. Phario Forel had written it, and he had the bloodiest quill of all of Braavos.</p>\n<p>Mercy found the company assembled behind the stage, and slipped in between Daena and the Snapper at the back, hoping her late arrival would go unnoticed. Izembaro was telling everyone that he expected the Gate to be packed to the rafters this evening, despite the fog. “The King of Westeros is sending his envoy to do homage to the King of the Mummers tonight,” he told his troupe. “We will not disappoint our fellow monarch.”</p>\n<p>“We?” said the Snapper, who did all the costumes for the mummers. “Is there more than one of him, now?”</p>\n<p>“He’s fat enough to count for two,” whispered Bobono. Every mummer’s troupe had to have a dwarf. He was theirs. When he saw Mercy, he gave her a leer. “Oho,” he said, “there she is. Is the little girl all ready for her rape?” He smacked his lips.</p>\n<p>The Snapper smacked him in the head. “Be quiet.”</p>\n<p>The King of the Mummers ignored the brief commotion. He was still talking, telling the mummers how magnificent they must be. Besides the Westerosi envoy, there would be keyholders in the crowd this evening, and famous courtesans as well. He did not intend for them to leave with a poor opinion of the Gate. “It shall go ill for any man who fails me,” he promised, a threat he borrowed from the speech Prince Garin gives on the eve of battle in Wroth of the Dragonlords, Phario Forel’s first play.</p>\n<p>By the time Izembaro finally finished speaking, less than an hour remained before the show, and the mummers were all frantic and fretful by turns. The Gate rang to the sound of Mercy’s name.</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” her friend Daena implored, “Lady Stork has stepped on the hem of her gown again. Come help me sew it up.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” the Stranger called, “bring the bloody paste, my horn is coming loose.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” boomed Izembaro the Great himself, “what have you done with my crown, girl? I cannot make my entrance without my crown. How shall they know that I’m a king?”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” squeaked the dwarf Bobono, “Mercy, something’s amiss with my laces, my cock keeps flopping out.”</p>\n<p>She fetched the sticky paste and fastened the Stranger’s left horn back onto his forehead. She found Izembaro’s crown in the privy where he always left it and helped him pin it to his wig, and then ran for needle and thread so the Snapper could sew the lace hem back onto the cloth-of-gold gown that the queen would wear in the wedding scene.</p>\n<p>And Bobono’s cock was indeed flopping out. It was made to flop out, for the rape. What a hideous thing, Mercy thought as she knelt before the dwarf to fix him. The cock was a foot long and as thick as her arm, big enough to be seen from the highest balcony. The dyer had done a poor job with the leather, though; the thing was a mottled pink and white, with a bulbous head the color of a plum. Mercy pushed it back into Bobono’s breeches and laced him back up. “Mercy,” he sang as she tied him tight, “Mercy, Mercy, come to my room tonight and make a man of me.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll make a eunuch of you if you keep unlacing yourself just so I’ll fiddle with your crotch.”</p>\n<p>“We were meant to be together, Mercy,” Bobono insisted. “Look, we’re just the same height.”</p>\n<p>“Only when I’m on my knees. Do you remember your first line?” It had only been a fortnight since the dwarf had lurched onto stage in his cups and opened The Anguish of the Archon with the grumpkin’s speech from The Merchant’s Lusty Lady. Izembaro would skin him alive if he made such a blunder again, and never mind how hard it was to find a good dwarf.</p>\n<p>“What are we playing, Mercy?” Bobono asked innocently.</p>\n<p>He is teasing me, Mercy thought. He’s not drunk tonight, he knows the show perfectly well. “We are doing Phario’s new Bloody Hand, in honor of the envoy from the Seven Kingdoms.”</p>\n<p>“Now I recall.” Bobono lowered his voice to a sinister croak. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he said. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude shape you see before you.” With that, he grabbed at her chest, fumbling for a nipple. “You have no titties. How can I rape a girl with no titties?”</p>\n<p>She caught his nose between her thumb and forefinger and twisted. “You’ll have no nose until you get your hands off me.”</p>\n<p>“Owwwww,” the dwarf squealed, releasing her.</p>\n<p>“I’ll grow titties in a year or two.” Mercy rose, to tower over the little man. “But you’ll never grow another nose. You think of that, before you touch me there.”</p>\n<p>Bobono rubbed his tender nose. “There’s no need to get so shy. I’ll be raping you soon enough.”</p>\n<p>“Not until the second act.”</p>\n<p>“I always give Wendeyne’s titties a nice squeeze when I rape her in The Anguish of the Archon,” the dwarf complained. “She likes it, and the pit does too. You have to please the pit.”</p>\n<p>That was one of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” as he liked to call them. You have to please the pit. “I bet it would please the pit if I ripped off the dwarf’s cock and beat him about the head with it,” Mercy replied. “That’s something they won’t have seen before.” Always give them something they haven’t seen before was another of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” and one that Bobono had no easy answer for. “There, you’re done,” Mercy announced. “Now see if you can keep in your breeches till it’s needed.”</p>\n<p>Izembaro was calling for her again. Now he could not find his boar spear. Mercy found it for him, helped Big Brusco don his boar suit, checked the trick daggers just to make certain no one had replaced one with a real blade (someone had done that at the Dome once, and a mummer had died), and poured Lady Stork the little nip of wine she liked to have before each play. When all the cries of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” finally died away, she stole a moment for a quick peek out into the house.</p>\n<p>The pit was as full as ever she’d seen it, and they were enjoying themselves already, joking and jostling, eating and drinking. She saw a peddler selling chunks of cheese, ripping them off the wheel with his fingers whenever he found a buyer. A woman had a bag of wrinkled apples. Skins of wine were being passed from hand to hand, some girls were selling kisses, and one sailor was playing the sea pipes. The sad-eyed little man called Quill stood in the back, come to see what he could steal for one of his own plays. Cossomo the Conjurer had come as well, and on his arm was Yna, the one-eyed whore from the Happy Port, but Mercy could not know those two, and they would not know Mercy. Daena recognized some Gate regulars in the crowd, and pointed them out for her; the dyer Dellono with his pinched white face and mottled purple hands, Galeo the sausage-maker in his greasy leather apron, tall Tomarro with his pet rat on his shoulder. “Tomarro best not let Galeo see that rat,” Daena warned. “That’s the only meat he puts in them sausages, I hear.” Mercy covered her mouth and laughed.</p>\n<p>The balconies were filling too. The first and third levels were for merchants and captains and other respectable folk. The bravos preferred the fourth and highest, where the seats were cheapest. It was a riot of bright color up there, while down below more somber shades held sway. The second balcony was cut up into private boxes where the mighty could comport themselves in comfort and privacy, safely apart from the vulgarity above and below. They had the best view of the stage, and servants to bring them food, wine, cushions, whatever they might desire. It was rare to find the second balcony more than half full at the Gate; such of the mighty who relished a night of mummery were more inclined to visit the Dome or the Blue Lantern, where the offerings were considered subtler and more poetic.</p>\n<p>This night was different, though, no doubt on account of the Westerosi envoy. In one box sat three scions of Otharys, each accompanied by a famous courtesan; Prestayn sat alone, a man so ancient that you wondered how he ever reached his seat; Torone and Pranelis shared a box, as they shared an uncomfortable alliance; the Third Sword was hosting a half-dozen friends.</p>\n<p>“I count five keyholders,” said Daena.</p>\n<p>“Bessaro is so fat you ought to count him twice,” Mercy replied, giggling. Izembaro had a belly on him, but compared to Bessaro he was as lithe as a willow. The keyholder was so big he needed a special seat, thrice the size of a common chair.</p>\n<p>“They’re all fat, them Reyaans,” Daena said. “Bellies as big as their ships. You should have seen the father. He made this one look small. One time he was summoned to the Hall of Truth to vote, but when he stepped onto his barge it sank.” She clutched Mercy by the elbow. “Look, the Sealord’s box.” The Sealord had never visited the Gate, but Izembaro named a box for him anyway, the largest and most opulent in the house. “That must be the Westerosi envoy. Have you ever seen such clothes on an old man? And look, he’s brought the Black Pearl!”</p>\n<p>The envoy was slight and balding, with a funny grey wisp of a beard growing from his chin. His cloak was yellow velvet, and his breeches. His doublet was a blue so bright it almost made Mercy’s eyes water. Upon his breast a shield had been embroidered in yellow thread, and on the shield was a proud blue rooster picked out in lapis lazuli. One of his guards helped him to his seat, while two others stood behind him in the back of the box.</p>\n<p>The woman with him could not have been more than a third his age. She was so lovely that the lamps seemed to burn brighter when she passed. She had dressed in a low-cut gown of pale yellow silk, startling against the light brown of her skin. Her black hair was bound up in a net of spun gold, and a jet-and-gold necklace brushed against the top of her full breasts. As they watched, she leaned close to the envoy and whispered something in his ear that made him laugh. “They should call her the Brown Pearl,” Mercy said to Daena. “She’s more brown than black.”</p>\n<p>“The first Black Pearl was black as a pot of ink,” said Daena. “She was a pirate queen, fathered by a Sealord’s son on a princess from the Summer Isles. A dragon king from Westeros took her for his lover.”</p>\n<p>“I would like to see a dragon,” Mercy said wistfully. “Why does the envoy have a chicken on his chest?”</p>\n<p>Daena howled. “Mercy, don’t you know anything? It’s his siggle. In the Sunset Kingdoms all the lords have siggles. Some have flowers, some have fish, some have bears and elks and other things. See, the envoy’s guards are wearing lions.”</p>\n<p>It was true. There were four guards; big, hard-looking men in ringmail, with heavy Westerosi longswords sheathed at their hips. Their crimson cloaks were bordered in whorls of gold, and golden lions with red garnet eyes clasped each cloak at the shoulder. When Mercy glanced at the faces beneath the gilded, lion-crested helm, her belly gave a quiver.The gods have given me a gift. Her fingers clutched hard at Daena’s arm. “That guard. The one on the end, behind the Black Pearl.”</p>\n<p>“What of him? Do you know him?”</p>\n<p>“No.” Mercy had been born and bred in Braavos, how could she know some Westerosi? She had to think a moment. “It’s only… well, he’s fair to look on, don’t you think?” He was, in a rough-hewn way, though his eyes were hard.</p>\n<p>Daena shrugged. “He’s very old. Not so old as the other ones, but… he could be thirty. And Westerosi. They’re terrible savages, Mercy. Best stay well away from his sort.”</p>\n<p>“Stay away?” Mercy giggled. She was a giggly sort of girl, was Mercy. “No. I’ve got to get closer.” She gave Daena a squeeze and said, “If the Snapper comes looking for me, tell her that I went off to read my lines again.” She only had a few, and most were just, “Oh, no, no, no,” and “Don’t, oh don’t, don’t touch me,” and “Please, m’lord, I am still a maiden,” but this was the first time Izembaro had given her any lines at all, so it was only to be expected that poor Mercy would want to get them right.</p>\n<p>The envoy from the Seven Kingdoms had taken two of his guards into his box to stand behind him and the Black Pearl, but the other two had been posted just outside the door to make certain he was not disturbed. They were talking quietly in the Common Tongue of Westeros as she slipped up silently behind them in the darkened passage. That was not a language Mercy knew.</p>\n<p>“Seven hells, this place is damp,” she heard her guard complain. “I’m chilled to the bones. Where are the bloody orange trees? I always heard there were orange trees in the Free Cities. Lemons and limes. Pomegranates. Hot peppers, warm nights, girls with bare bellies. Where are the bare-bellied girls, I ask you?”</p>\n<p>“Down in Lys, and Myr, and Old Volantis,” the other guard replied. He was an older man, big-bellied and grizzled. “I went to Lys with Lord Tywin once, when he was Hand to Aerys. Braavos is north of King’s Landing, fool. Can’t you read a bloody map?”</p>\n<p>“How long do you think we’ll be here?”</p>\n<p>“Longer than you’d like,” the old man replied. “If he goes back without the gold the queen will have his head. Besides, I seen that wife of his. There’s steps in Casterly Rock she can’t go down for fear she’d get stuck, that’s how fat she is. Who’d go back to that, when he has his sooty queen?”</p>\n<p>The handsome guardsman grinned. “Don’t suppose he’ll share her with us, afterward?”</p>\n<p>“What, are you mad? You think he notices the likes of us? Bloody bugger don’t even get our names right half the time. Maybe it was different with Clegane.”</p>\n<p>“Ser wasn’t one for mummer shows and fancy whores. When Ser wanted a woman he took one, but sometimes he’d let us have her, after. I wouldn’t mind having a taste of that Black Pearl. You think she’s pink between her legs?”</p>\n<p>Mercy wanted to hear more, but there was no time. The Bloody Hand was about to start, and the Snapper would be looking for her to help with costumes. Izembaro might be the King of the Mummers, but the Snapper was the one that they all feared. Time enough for her pretty guardsman later.</p>\n<p>The Bloody Hand opened in a lichyard.</p>\n<p>When the dwarf appeared suddenly from behind a wooden tombstone, the crowd began to hiss and curse. Bobono waddled to the front of the stage and leered at them. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he began, snarling the words. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay… “</p>\n<p>By then Marro had appeared behind him, gaunt and terrible in the Stranger’s long black robes. His face was black as well, his teeth red and shiny with blood, while ivory horns jutted upwards from his brow. Bobono could not see him, but the balconies could, and now the pit as well. The Gate grew deathly quiet. Marro moved forward silently.</p>\n<p>So did Mercy. The costumes were all hung, and the Snapper was busy sewing Daena into her gown for the court scene, so Mercy’s absence should not be noted. Quiet as a shadow, she slipped around the back again, up to where the guardsmen stood outside the envoy’s box. Standing in a darkened alcove, still as stone, she had a good look at his face. She studied it carefully, to be sure. Am I too young for him? she wondered. Too plain? Too skinny? She hoped he wasn’t the sort of man who liked big breasts on a girl. Bobono had been right about her chest. It would be best if I could take him back to my place, have him all to myself. But will he come with me?</p>\n<p>“You think it might be him?” the pretty one was saying.</p>\n<p>“What, did the Others take your wits?”</p>\n<p>“Why not? He’s a dwarf, ain’t he?”</p>\n<p>“The Imp weren’t the only dwarf in the world.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe not, but look here, everyone says how clever he was, true? So maybe he figures the last place his sister would ever look for him would be in some mummer show, making fun of himself. So he does just that, to tweak her nose.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, you’re mad.”</p>\n<p>“Well, maybe I’ll follow him after the mummery. Find out for myself.” The guardsman put a hand on the hilt of his sword. “If I’m right, I’ll be a ma lord, and if I’m wrong, well, bleed it, it’s just some dwarf.” He gave a bark of laughter.</p>\n<p>On stage, Bobono was bargaining with Marro’s sinister Stranger. He had a big voice for such a little man, and he made it ring off the highest rafters now. “Give me the cup,” he told the Stranger, “for I shall drink deep. And if it tastes of gold and lion’s blood, so much the better. As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them in fear in place of love.”</p>\n<p>Mercy mouthed the last lines along with him. They were better lines than hers, and apt besides. He’ll want me or he won’t, she thought, so let the play begin. She said a silent prayer to the god of many faces, slipped out of her alcove, and flounced up to the guardsmen. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy. “My lords,” she said, “do you speak Braavosi? Oh, please, tell me you do.”</p>\n<p>The two guardsmen exchanged a look. “What’s this thing going on about?” the older one asked. “Who is she?”</p>\n<p>“One of the mummers,” said the pretty one. He pushed his fair hair back off his brow and smiled at her. “Sorry, sweetling, we don’t speak your gibble-gabble.”</p>\n<p>Fuss and feathers, Mercy thought, they only know the Common Tongue. That was no good. Give it up or go ahead. She could not give it up. She wanted him so bad. “I know your tongue, a little,” she lied, with Mercy’s sweetest smile. “You are lords of Westeros, my friend said.”</p>\n<p>The old one laughed. “Lords? Aye, that’s us.”</p>\n<p>Mercy looked down at her feet, so shy. “Izembaro said to please the lords,” she whispered. “If there is anything you want, anything at all… “</p>\n<p>The two guardsmen exchanged a look. Then the handsome one reached out and touched her breast. “Anything?“</p>\n<p>“You’re disgusting,” said the older man.</p>\n<p>“Why? If this Izembaro wants to be hospitable, it would be rude to refuse.” He gave her nipple a tweak through the fabric of her dress, just the way the dwarf had done when she was fixing his cock for him. “Mummers are the next best thing to whores.”</p>\n<p>“Might be, but this one is a child.”</p>\n<p>“I am not,” lied Mercy. “I’m a maiden now.”</p>\n<p>“Not for long,” said the comely one. “I’m Lord Rafford, sweetling, and I know just what I want. Hike up those skirts now, and lean back against that wall.”</p>\n<p>“Not here,” Mercy said, brushing his hands away. “Not where the play is on. I might cry out, and Izembaro would be mad.”</p>\n<p>“Where, then?”</p>\n<p>“I know a place.”</p>\n<p>The older guard was scowling. “What, you think can just scamper off? What if his knightliness comes looking for you?”</p>\n<p>“Why would he? He’s got a show to watch. And he’s got his own whore, why shouldn’t I have mine? This won’t take long.”</p>\n<p>No, she thought, it won’t. Mercy took him by the hand, led him through the back and down the steps and out into the foggy night. “You could be a mummer, if you wanted,” she told him, as he pressed her up against the wall of the playhouse.</p>\n<p>“Me?” The guardsman snorted. “Not me, girl. All that bloody talking, I wouldn’t remember half of it.”</p>\n<p>“It’s hard at first,” she admitted. “But after a time it comes easier. I could teach you to say a line. I could.”</p>\n<p>He grabbed her wrist. “I’ll do the teaching. Time for your first lesson.” He pulled her hard against him and kissed her on the lips, forcing his tongue into her mouth. It was all wet and slimy, like an eel. Mercy licked it with her own tongue, then broke away from him, breathless. “Not here. Someone might see. My room’s not far, but hurry. I have to be back before the second act, or I’ll miss my rape.”</p>\n<p>He grinned. “No fear o’ that, girl.” But he let her pull him after her. Hand in hand, they went racing through the fog, over bridges and through alleys and up five flights of splintery wooden stairs. The guardsman was panting by the time they burst through the door of her little room. Mercy lit a tallow candle, then danced around at him, giggling. “Oh, now you’re all tired out. I forgot how old you were, m’lord. Do you want to take a little nap? Just lie down and close your eyes, and I’ll come back after the Imp’s done raping me.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not going anywhere.” He pulled her roughly to him. “Get those rags off, and I’ll show you how old I am, girl.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” she said. “My name is Mercy. Can you say it?”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” he said. “My name is Raff.”</p>\n<p>“I know.” She slipped her hand between his legs, and felt how hard he was through the wool of his breeches.</p>\n<p>“The laces,” he urged her. “Be a sweet girl and undo them.” Instead she slid her finger down along the inside of his thigh. He gave a grunt. “Damn, be careful there, you — “</p>\n<p>Mercy gave a gasp and stepped away, her face confused and frightened. “You’rebleeding.”</p>\n<p>“Wha — ” He looked down at himself. “Gods be good. What did you do to me, you little cunt?” The red stain spread across his thigh, soaking the heavy fabric.</p>\n<p>“Nothing,” Mercy squeaked. “I never… oh, oh, there’s so much blood. Stop it, stop it, you’re scaring me.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head, a dazed look on his face. When he pressed his hand to his thigh, blood squirted through his fingers. It was running down his leg, into his boot. He doesn’t look so comely now, she thought. He just looks white and frightened.</p>\n<p>“A towel,” the guardsman gasped. “Bring me a towel, a rag, press down on it. Gods. I feel dizzy.” His leg was drenched with blood from the thigh down. When he tried to put his weight on it, his knee buckled and he fell. “Help me,” he pleaded, as the crotch of his breeches reddened. “Mother have mercy, girl. A healer… run and find a healer, quick now.”</p>\n<p>“There’s one on the next canal, but he won’t come. You have to go to him. Can’t you walk?”</p>\n<p>“Walk?” His fingers were slick with blood. “Are you blind, girl? I’m bleeding like a stuck pig. I can’t walk on this.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” she said, “I don’t know how you’ll get there, then.”</p>\n<p>“You’ll need to carry me.”</p>\n<p>See? thought Mercy. You know your line, and so do I.</p>\n<p>“Think so?” asked Arya, sweetly.</p>\n<p>Raff the Sweetling looked up sharply as the long thin blade came sliding from her sleeve. She slipped it through his throat beneath the chin, twisted, and ripped it back out sideways with a single smooth slash. A fine red rain followed, and in his eyes the light went out.</p>\n<p>“Valar morghulis,” Arya whispered, but Raff was dead and did not hear. She sniffed. I should have helped him down the steps before I killed him. Now I’ll need to drag him all the way to the canal and roll him in. The eels would do the rest.</p>\n<p>“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang sadly. A foolish, giddy girl she’d been, but good hearted. She would miss her, and she would miss Daena and the Snapper and the rest, even Izembaro and Bobono. This would make trouble for the Sealord and the envoy with the chicken on his chest, she did not doubt.</p>\n<p>She would think about that later, though. Just now, there was no time. I had best run. Mercy still had some lines to say, her first lines and her last, and Izembaro would have her pretty little empty head if she were late for her own rape.</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"<h2 id=\"MERCYE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\"><a href=\"#MERCYE-EXCERPT-FROM-THE-WINDS-OF-WINTER\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"MERCYE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\"></a>MERCYE--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER</h2><p>She woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.</p>\n<p>The smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on the scent of prey.</p>\n<p>Half-light filled the room, grey and gloomy. Shivering, she sat up in bed and ran a hand across her scalp. Stubble bristled against her palm. I need to shave before Izembaro sees. Mercy, I’m Mercy, and tonight I’ll be raped and murdered. Her true name was Mercedene, but Mercy was all anyone ever called her…<br>","more":"<br>Except in dreams. She took a breath to quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of what she’d dreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it, though, and a full moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she ran.</p>\n<p>She had fastened the shutters back so the morning sun might wake her. But there was no sun outside the window of Mercy’s little room, only a wall of shifting grey fog. The air had grown chilly… and a good thing, else she might have slept all day. It would be just like Mercy to sleep through her own rape.</p>\n<p>Gooseprickles covered her legs. Her coverlet had twisted around her like a snake. She unwound it, threw the blanket to the bare plank floor and padded naked to the window. Braavos was lost in fog. She could see the green water of the little canal below, the cobbled stone street that ran beneath her building, two arches of the mossy bridge… but the far end of the bridge vanished in greyness, and of the buildings across the canal only a few vague lights remained. She heard a soft splash as a serpent boat emerged beneath the bridge’s central arch. “What hour?” Mercy called down to the man who stood by the snake’s uplifted tail, pushing her onward with his pole.</p>\n<p>The waterman gazed up, searching for the voice. “Four, by the Titan’s roar.” His words echoed hollowly off the swirling green waters and the walls of unseen buildings.</p>\n<p>She was not late, not yet, but she should not dawdle. Mercy was a happy soul and a hard worker, but seldom timely. That would not serve tonight. The envoy from Westeros was expected at the Gate this evening, and Izembaro would be in no mood to hear excuses, even if she served them up with a sweet smile.</p>\n<p>She had filled her basin from the canal last night before she went to sleep, preferring the brackish water to the slimy green rainwater stewing in the cistern out back. Dipping a rough cloth, she washed herself head to heel, standing on one leg at a time to scrub her calloused feet. After that she found her razor. A bare scalp helped the wigs fit better, Izembaro claimed.</p>\n<p>She shaved, donned her smallclothes, and slipped a shapeless brown wool dress down over her head. One of her stockings needed mending, she saw as she pulled it up. She would ask the Snapper for help; her own sewing was so wretched that the wardrobe mistress usually took pity on her. Else I could filtch a nicer pair from wardrobe. That was risky, though. Izembaro hated it when the mummers wore his costumes in the streets.Except for Wendeyne. Give Izembaro’s cock a little suck and a girl can wear any costume that she wants. Mercy was not so foolish as all that. Daena had warned her. “Girls who start down that road wind up on the Ship, where every man in the pit knows he can have any pretty thing he might see up on the stage, if his purse is plump enough.”</p>\n<p>Her boots were lumps of old brown leather mottled with saltstains and cracked from long wear, her belt a length of hempen rope dyed blue. She knotted it about her waist, and hung a knife on her right hip and a coin pouch on her left. Last of all she threw her cloak across her shoulders. It was a real mummer’s cloak, purple wool lined in red silk, with a hood to keep the rain off, and three secret pockets too. She’d hid some coins in one of those, an iron key in another, a blade in the last. A real blade, not a fruit knife like the one on her hip, but it did not belong to Mercy, no more than her other treasures did. The fruit knife belonged to Mercy. She was made for eating fruit, for smiling and joking, for working hard and doing as she was told.</p>\n<p>“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang as she descended the wooden stair to the street. The handrail was splintery, the steps steep, and there were five flights, but that was why she’d gotten the room so cheap. That, and Mercy’s smile. She might be bald and skinny, but Mercy had a pretty smile, and a certain grace. Even Izembaro agreed that she was graceful. She was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with feet instead of wings the way was longer. Braavos was a crooked city. The streets were crooked, the alleys were crookeder, and the canals were crookedest of all. Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the Ragman’s Road along the Outer Harbor, where she had the sea before her and the sky above, and a clear view across the Great Lagoon to the Arsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail her as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of tarry Ibbenese whalers and big-bellied Westerosi cogs. Mercy could not always understand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes she would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if they had the coin.</p>\n<p>The long way also took her across the Bridge of Eyes with its carved stone faces. From the top of its span, she could look through the arches and see all the city: the green copper domes of the Hall of Truth, the masts rising like a forest from the Purple Harbor, the tall towers of the mighty, the golden thunderbolt turning on its spire atop the Sealord’s Palace… even the Titan’s bronze shoulders, off across the dark green waters. But that was only when the sun was shining down on Braavos. If the fog was thick there was nothing to see but grey, so today Mercy chose the shorter route to save some wear on her poor cracked boots.</p>\n<p>The mists seemed to part before her and close up again as she passed. The cobblestones were wet and slick under her feet. She heard a cat yowl plaintively. Braavos was a good city for cats, and they roamed everywhere, especially at night. In the fog all cats are grey, Mercy thought. In the fog all men are killers.</p>\n<p>She had never seen a thicker fog than this one. On the larger canals, the watermen would be running their serpent boats into one another, unable to make out any more than dim lights from the buildings to either side of them.</p>\n<p>Mercy passed an old man with a lantern walking the other way, and envied him his light. The street was so gloomy she could scarcely see where she was stepping. In the humbler parts of the city, the houses, shops, and warehouses crowded together, leaning on each other like drunken lovers, their upper stories so close that you could step from one balcony to the next. The streets below became dark tunnels where every footfall echoed. The small canals were even more hazardous, since many of the houses that lined them had privies jutting out over the water. Izembaro loved to give the Sealord’s speech fromThe Merchant’s Melancholy Daughter, about how “here the last Titan yet stands, astride the stony shoulders of his brothers,” but Mercy preferred the scene where the fat merchant shat on the Sealord’s head as he passed underneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something like that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and sailor alike howl with laughter to see it.</p>\n<p>The Gate stood close by the edge of Drowned Town, between the Outer Harbor and the Purple Harbor. An old warehouse had burnt there and the ground was sinking a little more each year, so the land came cheap. Atop the flooded stone foundation of the warehouse, Izembaro raised his cavernous playhall. The Dome and the Blue Lantern might enjoy more fashionable environs, he told his mummers, but here between the harbors they would never lack for sailors and whores to fill their pit. The Ship was close by, still pulling handsome crowds to the quay where she had been moored for twenty years, he said, and the Gate would flourish too.</p>\n<p>Time had proved him right. The Gate’s stage had developed a tilt as the building settled, their costumes were prone to mildew, and water snakes nested in the flooded cellar, but none of that troubled the mummers so long as the house was full.</p>\n<p>The last bridge was made of rope and raw planks, and seemed to dissolve into nothingness, but that was only the fog. Mercy scampered across, her heels ringing on the wood. The fog opened before her like a tattered grey curtain to reveal the playhouse. Buttery yellow light spilled from the doors, and Mercy could hear voices from within. Beside the entrance, Big Brusco had painted over the title of the last show, and writtenThe Bloody Hand in its place in huge red letters. He was painting a bloody hand beneath the words, for those who could not read. Mercy stopped to have a look. “That’s a nice hand,” she told him.</p>\n<p>“Thumb’s crooked.” Brusco dabbed at it with his brush. “King o’ the Mummers been asking after you.”</p>\n<p>“It was so dark I slept and slept.” When Izembaro had first dubbed himself the King of the Mummers, the company had taken a wicked pleasure in it, savoring the outrage of their rivals from the Dome and the Blue Lantern. Of late, though, Izembaro had begun to take his title too seriously. “He will only play kings now,” Marro said, rolling his eyes, “and if the play has no king in it, he would sooner not stage it at all.”</p>\n<p>The Bloody Hand offered two kings, the fat one and the boy. Izembaro would play the fat one. It was not a large part, but he had a fine speech as he lay dying, and a splendid fight with a demonic boar before that. Phario Forel had written it, and he had the bloodiest quill of all of Braavos.</p>\n<p>Mercy found the company assembled behind the stage, and slipped in between Daena and the Snapper at the back, hoping her late arrival would go unnoticed. Izembaro was telling everyone that he expected the Gate to be packed to the rafters this evening, despite the fog. “The King of Westeros is sending his envoy to do homage to the King of the Mummers tonight,” he told his troupe. “We will not disappoint our fellow monarch.”</p>\n<p>“We?” said the Snapper, who did all the costumes for the mummers. “Is there more than one of him, now?”</p>\n<p>“He’s fat enough to count for two,” whispered Bobono. Every mummer’s troupe had to have a dwarf. He was theirs. When he saw Mercy, he gave her a leer. “Oho,” he said, “there she is. Is the little girl all ready for her rape?” He smacked his lips.</p>\n<p>The Snapper smacked him in the head. “Be quiet.”</p>\n<p>The King of the Mummers ignored the brief commotion. He was still talking, telling the mummers how magnificent they must be. Besides the Westerosi envoy, there would be keyholders in the crowd this evening, and famous courtesans as well. He did not intend for them to leave with a poor opinion of the Gate. “It shall go ill for any man who fails me,” he promised, a threat he borrowed from the speech Prince Garin gives on the eve of battle in Wroth of the Dragonlords, Phario Forel’s first play.</p>\n<p>By the time Izembaro finally finished speaking, less than an hour remained before the show, and the mummers were all frantic and fretful by turns. The Gate rang to the sound of Mercy’s name.</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” her friend Daena implored, “Lady Stork has stepped on the hem of her gown again. Come help me sew it up.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” the Stranger called, “bring the bloody paste, my horn is coming loose.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” boomed Izembaro the Great himself, “what have you done with my crown, girl? I cannot make my entrance without my crown. How shall they know that I’m a king?”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” squeaked the dwarf Bobono, “Mercy, something’s amiss with my laces, my cock keeps flopping out.”</p>\n<p>She fetched the sticky paste and fastened the Stranger’s left horn back onto his forehead. She found Izembaro’s crown in the privy where he always left it and helped him pin it to his wig, and then ran for needle and thread so the Snapper could sew the lace hem back onto the cloth-of-gold gown that the queen would wear in the wedding scene.</p>\n<p>And Bobono’s cock was indeed flopping out. It was made to flop out, for the rape. What a hideous thing, Mercy thought as she knelt before the dwarf to fix him. The cock was a foot long and as thick as her arm, big enough to be seen from the highest balcony. The dyer had done a poor job with the leather, though; the thing was a mottled pink and white, with a bulbous head the color of a plum. Mercy pushed it back into Bobono’s breeches and laced him back up. “Mercy,” he sang as she tied him tight, “Mercy, Mercy, come to my room tonight and make a man of me.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll make a eunuch of you if you keep unlacing yourself just so I’ll fiddle with your crotch.”</p>\n<p>“We were meant to be together, Mercy,” Bobono insisted. “Look, we’re just the same height.”</p>\n<p>“Only when I’m on my knees. Do you remember your first line?” It had only been a fortnight since the dwarf had lurched onto stage in his cups and opened The Anguish of the Archon with the grumpkin’s speech from The Merchant’s Lusty Lady. Izembaro would skin him alive if he made such a blunder again, and never mind how hard it was to find a good dwarf.</p>\n<p>“What are we playing, Mercy?” Bobono asked innocently.</p>\n<p>He is teasing me, Mercy thought. He’s not drunk tonight, he knows the show perfectly well. “We are doing Phario’s new Bloody Hand, in honor of the envoy from the Seven Kingdoms.”</p>\n<p>“Now I recall.” Bobono lowered his voice to a sinister croak. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he said. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude shape you see before you.” With that, he grabbed at her chest, fumbling for a nipple. “You have no titties. How can I rape a girl with no titties?”</p>\n<p>She caught his nose between her thumb and forefinger and twisted. “You’ll have no nose until you get your hands off me.”</p>\n<p>“Owwwww,” the dwarf squealed, releasing her.</p>\n<p>“I’ll grow titties in a year or two.” Mercy rose, to tower over the little man. “But you’ll never grow another nose. You think of that, before you touch me there.”</p>\n<p>Bobono rubbed his tender nose. “There’s no need to get so shy. I’ll be raping you soon enough.”</p>\n<p>“Not until the second act.”</p>\n<p>“I always give Wendeyne’s titties a nice squeeze when I rape her in The Anguish of the Archon,” the dwarf complained. “She likes it, and the pit does too. You have to please the pit.”</p>\n<p>That was one of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” as he liked to call them. You have to please the pit. “I bet it would please the pit if I ripped off the dwarf’s cock and beat him about the head with it,” Mercy replied. “That’s something they won’t have seen before.” Always give them something they haven’t seen before was another of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” and one that Bobono had no easy answer for. “There, you’re done,” Mercy announced. “Now see if you can keep in your breeches till it’s needed.”</p>\n<p>Izembaro was calling for her again. Now he could not find his boar spear. Mercy found it for him, helped Big Brusco don his boar suit, checked the trick daggers just to make certain no one had replaced one with a real blade (someone had done that at the Dome once, and a mummer had died), and poured Lady Stork the little nip of wine she liked to have before each play. When all the cries of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” finally died away, she stole a moment for a quick peek out into the house.</p>\n<p>The pit was as full as ever she’d seen it, and they were enjoying themselves already, joking and jostling, eating and drinking. She saw a peddler selling chunks of cheese, ripping them off the wheel with his fingers whenever he found a buyer. A woman had a bag of wrinkled apples. Skins of wine were being passed from hand to hand, some girls were selling kisses, and one sailor was playing the sea pipes. The sad-eyed little man called Quill stood in the back, come to see what he could steal for one of his own plays. Cossomo the Conjurer had come as well, and on his arm was Yna, the one-eyed whore from the Happy Port, but Mercy could not know those two, and they would not know Mercy. Daena recognized some Gate regulars in the crowd, and pointed them out for her; the dyer Dellono with his pinched white face and mottled purple hands, Galeo the sausage-maker in his greasy leather apron, tall Tomarro with his pet rat on his shoulder. “Tomarro best not let Galeo see that rat,” Daena warned. “That’s the only meat he puts in them sausages, I hear.” Mercy covered her mouth and laughed.</p>\n<p>The balconies were filling too. The first and third levels were for merchants and captains and other respectable folk. The bravos preferred the fourth and highest, where the seats were cheapest. It was a riot of bright color up there, while down below more somber shades held sway. The second balcony was cut up into private boxes where the mighty could comport themselves in comfort and privacy, safely apart from the vulgarity above and below. They had the best view of the stage, and servants to bring them food, wine, cushions, whatever they might desire. It was rare to find the second balcony more than half full at the Gate; such of the mighty who relished a night of mummery were more inclined to visit the Dome or the Blue Lantern, where the offerings were considered subtler and more poetic.</p>\n<p>This night was different, though, no doubt on account of the Westerosi envoy. In one box sat three scions of Otharys, each accompanied by a famous courtesan; Prestayn sat alone, a man so ancient that you wondered how he ever reached his seat; Torone and Pranelis shared a box, as they shared an uncomfortable alliance; the Third Sword was hosting a half-dozen friends.</p>\n<p>“I count five keyholders,” said Daena.</p>\n<p>“Bessaro is so fat you ought to count him twice,” Mercy replied, giggling. Izembaro had a belly on him, but compared to Bessaro he was as lithe as a willow. The keyholder was so big he needed a special seat, thrice the size of a common chair.</p>\n<p>“They’re all fat, them Reyaans,” Daena said. “Bellies as big as their ships. You should have seen the father. He made this one look small. One time he was summoned to the Hall of Truth to vote, but when he stepped onto his barge it sank.” She clutched Mercy by the elbow. “Look, the Sealord’s box.” The Sealord had never visited the Gate, but Izembaro named a box for him anyway, the largest and most opulent in the house. “That must be the Westerosi envoy. Have you ever seen such clothes on an old man? And look, he’s brought the Black Pearl!”</p>\n<p>The envoy was slight and balding, with a funny grey wisp of a beard growing from his chin. His cloak was yellow velvet, and his breeches. His doublet was a blue so bright it almost made Mercy’s eyes water. Upon his breast a shield had been embroidered in yellow thread, and on the shield was a proud blue rooster picked out in lapis lazuli. One of his guards helped him to his seat, while two others stood behind him in the back of the box.</p>\n<p>The woman with him could not have been more than a third his age. She was so lovely that the lamps seemed to burn brighter when she passed. She had dressed in a low-cut gown of pale yellow silk, startling against the light brown of her skin. Her black hair was bound up in a net of spun gold, and a jet-and-gold necklace brushed against the top of her full breasts. As they watched, she leaned close to the envoy and whispered something in his ear that made him laugh. “They should call her the Brown Pearl,” Mercy said to Daena. “She’s more brown than black.”</p>\n<p>“The first Black Pearl was black as a pot of ink,” said Daena. “She was a pirate queen, fathered by a Sealord’s son on a princess from the Summer Isles. A dragon king from Westeros took her for his lover.”</p>\n<p>“I would like to see a dragon,” Mercy said wistfully. “Why does the envoy have a chicken on his chest?”</p>\n<p>Daena howled. “Mercy, don’t you know anything? It’s his siggle. In the Sunset Kingdoms all the lords have siggles. Some have flowers, some have fish, some have bears and elks and other things. See, the envoy’s guards are wearing lions.”</p>\n<p>It was true. There were four guards; big, hard-looking men in ringmail, with heavy Westerosi longswords sheathed at their hips. Their crimson cloaks were bordered in whorls of gold, and golden lions with red garnet eyes clasped each cloak at the shoulder. When Mercy glanced at the faces beneath the gilded, lion-crested helm, her belly gave a quiver.The gods have given me a gift. Her fingers clutched hard at Daena’s arm. “That guard. The one on the end, behind the Black Pearl.”</p>\n<p>“What of him? Do you know him?”</p>\n<p>“No.” Mercy had been born and bred in Braavos, how could she know some Westerosi? She had to think a moment. “It’s only… well, he’s fair to look on, don’t you think?” He was, in a rough-hewn way, though his eyes were hard.</p>\n<p>Daena shrugged. “He’s very old. Not so old as the other ones, but… he could be thirty. And Westerosi. They’re terrible savages, Mercy. Best stay well away from his sort.”</p>\n<p>“Stay away?” Mercy giggled. She was a giggly sort of girl, was Mercy. “No. I’ve got to get closer.” She gave Daena a squeeze and said, “If the Snapper comes looking for me, tell her that I went off to read my lines again.” She only had a few, and most were just, “Oh, no, no, no,” and “Don’t, oh don’t, don’t touch me,” and “Please, m’lord, I am still a maiden,” but this was the first time Izembaro had given her any lines at all, so it was only to be expected that poor Mercy would want to get them right.</p>\n<p>The envoy from the Seven Kingdoms had taken two of his guards into his box to stand behind him and the Black Pearl, but the other two had been posted just outside the door to make certain he was not disturbed. They were talking quietly in the Common Tongue of Westeros as she slipped up silently behind them in the darkened passage. That was not a language Mercy knew.</p>\n<p>“Seven hells, this place is damp,” she heard her guard complain. “I’m chilled to the bones. Where are the bloody orange trees? I always heard there were orange trees in the Free Cities. Lemons and limes. Pomegranates. Hot peppers, warm nights, girls with bare bellies. Where are the bare-bellied girls, I ask you?”</p>\n<p>“Down in Lys, and Myr, and Old Volantis,” the other guard replied. He was an older man, big-bellied and grizzled. “I went to Lys with Lord Tywin once, when he was Hand to Aerys. Braavos is north of King’s Landing, fool. Can’t you read a bloody map?”</p>\n<p>“How long do you think we’ll be here?”</p>\n<p>“Longer than you’d like,” the old man replied. “If he goes back without the gold the queen will have his head. Besides, I seen that wife of his. There’s steps in Casterly Rock she can’t go down for fear she’d get stuck, that’s how fat she is. Who’d go back to that, when he has his sooty queen?”</p>\n<p>The handsome guardsman grinned. “Don’t suppose he’ll share her with us, afterward?”</p>\n<p>“What, are you mad? You think he notices the likes of us? Bloody bugger don’t even get our names right half the time. Maybe it was different with Clegane.”</p>\n<p>“Ser wasn’t one for mummer shows and fancy whores. When Ser wanted a woman he took one, but sometimes he’d let us have her, after. I wouldn’t mind having a taste of that Black Pearl. You think she’s pink between her legs?”</p>\n<p>Mercy wanted to hear more, but there was no time. The Bloody Hand was about to start, and the Snapper would be looking for her to help with costumes. Izembaro might be the King of the Mummers, but the Snapper was the one that they all feared. Time enough for her pretty guardsman later.</p>\n<p>The Bloody Hand opened in a lichyard.</p>\n<p>When the dwarf appeared suddenly from behind a wooden tombstone, the crowd began to hiss and curse. Bobono waddled to the front of the stage and leered at them. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he began, snarling the words. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay… “</p>\n<p>By then Marro had appeared behind him, gaunt and terrible in the Stranger’s long black robes. His face was black as well, his teeth red and shiny with blood, while ivory horns jutted upwards from his brow. Bobono could not see him, but the balconies could, and now the pit as well. The Gate grew deathly quiet. Marro moved forward silently.</p>\n<p>So did Mercy. The costumes were all hung, and the Snapper was busy sewing Daena into her gown for the court scene, so Mercy’s absence should not be noted. Quiet as a shadow, she slipped around the back again, up to where the guardsmen stood outside the envoy’s box. Standing in a darkened alcove, still as stone, she had a good look at his face. She studied it carefully, to be sure. Am I too young for him? she wondered. Too plain? Too skinny? She hoped he wasn’t the sort of man who liked big breasts on a girl. Bobono had been right about her chest. It would be best if I could take him back to my place, have him all to myself. But will he come with me?</p>\n<p>“You think it might be him?” the pretty one was saying.</p>\n<p>“What, did the Others take your wits?”</p>\n<p>“Why not? He’s a dwarf, ain’t he?”</p>\n<p>“The Imp weren’t the only dwarf in the world.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe not, but look here, everyone says how clever he was, true? So maybe he figures the last place his sister would ever look for him would be in some mummer show, making fun of himself. So he does just that, to tweak her nose.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, you’re mad.”</p>\n<p>“Well, maybe I’ll follow him after the mummery. Find out for myself.” The guardsman put a hand on the hilt of his sword. “If I’m right, I’ll be a ma lord, and if I’m wrong, well, bleed it, it’s just some dwarf.” He gave a bark of laughter.</p>\n<p>On stage, Bobono was bargaining with Marro’s sinister Stranger. He had a big voice for such a little man, and he made it ring off the highest rafters now. “Give me the cup,” he told the Stranger, “for I shall drink deep. And if it tastes of gold and lion’s blood, so much the better. As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them in fear in place of love.”</p>\n<p>Mercy mouthed the last lines along with him. They were better lines than hers, and apt besides. He’ll want me or he won’t, she thought, so let the play begin. She said a silent prayer to the god of many faces, slipped out of her alcove, and flounced up to the guardsmen. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy. “My lords,” she said, “do you speak Braavosi? Oh, please, tell me you do.”</p>\n<p>The two guardsmen exchanged a look. “What’s this thing going on about?” the older one asked. “Who is she?”</p>\n<p>“One of the mummers,” said the pretty one. He pushed his fair hair back off his brow and smiled at her. “Sorry, sweetling, we don’t speak your gibble-gabble.”</p>\n<p>Fuss and feathers, Mercy thought, they only know the Common Tongue. That was no good. Give it up or go ahead. She could not give it up. She wanted him so bad. “I know your tongue, a little,” she lied, with Mercy’s sweetest smile. “You are lords of Westeros, my friend said.”</p>\n<p>The old one laughed. “Lords? Aye, that’s us.”</p>\n<p>Mercy looked down at her feet, so shy. “Izembaro said to please the lords,” she whispered. “If there is anything you want, anything at all… “</p>\n<p>The two guardsmen exchanged a look. Then the handsome one reached out and touched her breast. “Anything?“</p>\n<p>“You’re disgusting,” said the older man.</p>\n<p>“Why? If this Izembaro wants to be hospitable, it would be rude to refuse.” He gave her nipple a tweak through the fabric of her dress, just the way the dwarf had done when she was fixing his cock for him. “Mummers are the next best thing to whores.”</p>\n<p>“Might be, but this one is a child.”</p>\n<p>“I am not,” lied Mercy. “I’m a maiden now.”</p>\n<p>“Not for long,” said the comely one. “I’m Lord Rafford, sweetling, and I know just what I want. Hike up those skirts now, and lean back against that wall.”</p>\n<p>“Not here,” Mercy said, brushing his hands away. “Not where the play is on. I might cry out, and Izembaro would be mad.”</p>\n<p>“Where, then?”</p>\n<p>“I know a place.”</p>\n<p>The older guard was scowling. “What, you think can just scamper off? What if his knightliness comes looking for you?”</p>\n<p>“Why would he? He’s got a show to watch. And he’s got his own whore, why shouldn’t I have mine? This won’t take long.”</p>\n<p>No, she thought, it won’t. Mercy took him by the hand, led him through the back and down the steps and out into the foggy night. “You could be a mummer, if you wanted,” she told him, as he pressed her up against the wall of the playhouse.</p>\n<p>“Me?” The guardsman snorted. “Not me, girl. All that bloody talking, I wouldn’t remember half of it.”</p>\n<p>“It’s hard at first,” she admitted. “But after a time it comes easier. I could teach you to say a line. I could.”</p>\n<p>He grabbed her wrist. “I’ll do the teaching. Time for your first lesson.” He pulled her hard against him and kissed her on the lips, forcing his tongue into her mouth. It was all wet and slimy, like an eel. Mercy licked it with her own tongue, then broke away from him, breathless. “Not here. Someone might see. My room’s not far, but hurry. I have to be back before the second act, or I’ll miss my rape.”</p>\n<p>He grinned. “No fear o’ that, girl.” But he let her pull him after her. Hand in hand, they went racing through the fog, over bridges and through alleys and up five flights of splintery wooden stairs. The guardsman was panting by the time they burst through the door of her little room. Mercy lit a tallow candle, then danced around at him, giggling. “Oh, now you’re all tired out. I forgot how old you were, m’lord. Do you want to take a little nap? Just lie down and close your eyes, and I’ll come back after the Imp’s done raping me.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not going anywhere.” He pulled her roughly to him. “Get those rags off, and I’ll show you how old I am, girl.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” she said. “My name is Mercy. Can you say it?”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” he said. “My name is Raff.”</p>\n<p>“I know.” She slipped her hand between his legs, and felt how hard he was through the wool of his breeches.</p>\n<p>“The laces,” he urged her. “Be a sweet girl and undo them.” Instead she slid her finger down along the inside of his thigh. He gave a grunt. “Damn, be careful there, you — “</p>\n<p>Mercy gave a gasp and stepped away, her face confused and frightened. “You’rebleeding.”</p>\n<p>“Wha — ” He looked down at himself. “Gods be good. What did you do to me, you little cunt?” The red stain spread across his thigh, soaking the heavy fabric.</p>\n<p>“Nothing,” Mercy squeaked. “I never… oh, oh, there’s so much blood. Stop it, stop it, you’re scaring me.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head, a dazed look on his face. When he pressed his hand to his thigh, blood squirted through his fingers. It was running down his leg, into his boot. He doesn’t look so comely now, she thought. He just looks white and frightened.</p>\n<p>“A towel,” the guardsman gasped. “Bring me a towel, a rag, press down on it. Gods. I feel dizzy.” His leg was drenched with blood from the thigh down. When he tried to put his weight on it, his knee buckled and he fell. “Help me,” he pleaded, as the crotch of his breeches reddened. “Mother have mercy, girl. A healer… run and find a healer, quick now.”</p>\n<p>“There’s one on the next canal, but he won’t come. You have to go to him. Can’t you walk?”</p>\n<p>“Walk?” His fingers were slick with blood. “Are you blind, girl? I’m bleeding like a stuck pig. I can’t walk on this.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” she said, “I don’t know how you’ll get there, then.”</p>\n<p>“You’ll need to carry me.”</p>\n<p>See? thought Mercy. You know your line, and so do I.</p>\n<p>“Think so?” asked Arya, sweetly.</p>\n<p>Raff the Sweetling looked up sharply as the long thin blade came sliding from her sleeve. She slipped it through his throat beneath the chin, twisted, and ripped it back out sideways with a single smooth slash. A fine red rain followed, and in his eyes the light went out.</p>\n<p>“Valar morghulis,” Arya whispered, but Raff was dead and did not hear. She sniffed. I should have helped him down the steps before I killed him. Now I’ll need to drag him all the way to the canal and roll him in. The eels would do the rest.</p>\n<p>“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang sadly. A foolish, giddy girl she’d been, but good hearted. She would miss her, and she would miss Daena and the Snapper and the rest, even Izembaro and Bobono. This would make trouble for the Sealord and the envoy with the chicken on his chest, she did not doubt.</p>\n<p>She would think about that later, though. Just now, there was no time. I had best run. Mercy still had some lines to say, her first lines and her last, and Izembaro would have her pretty little empty head if she were late for her own rape.</p>"},{"title":"思考篇：2","date":"2016-12-26T16:00:00.000Z","comments":0,"_content":"\n从哪儿开始写好呢？算起来这是一篇拖了很久的文章，一直打算要写的，可是直到现在才开始，毕竟一篇文章不是一篇谈话节目，要有清晰的结构，不然的话变成流水账就显得没有意义了，而我从来没有想好这篇文章究竟该从哪儿开始。2016年就要结束了，那就当这是一篇年终总结吧！\n\n<!--more-->\n迄今，大学毕业已达年半有余，然吾等默默无闻之辈依然悲悲戚戚。在这一年半的时间里发生了很多事情，有很多始料未及，也有很多有意为之的事情。由刚开始更多面临的如何活下去，到今日开始思考如何生存的更好的问题上面，渐渐地作出了选择。我无法回答这种选择是否正确，我大概只能问，为了自己的选择究竟努力了多少。\n\n想想走过的这一年半，从大学宿舍，到公司宿舍，到舍友租的房子里面的临时借宿，再到用光积蓄颤抖着双手去找人生第一次要租的房子，再到现在费劲心机终于安稳住了一段时间。回头发现，我终于还是自己走出了第一步，哪怕这第一步走的那么艰难，我还是迈步走出来了。2014年底用了两个月的实习工资买了Pad

Bad</code>我想我可以解释下是什么意思，<code>Ser</code>是一个不存在的词，是J·R·R·马丁大爷创造的，意思是<code>爵士</code>的意思，大概是因为我很迷恋那种爵士的绅士风度吧，虽然马丁大爷的作品里面和风度一毛钱关系都没有。既然买了新的域名，我就要想办法把这个域名维护下去，不然的话乱花钱就真的是<code>Bad</code>了。</p>\n<p>国庆前夕，早上高高兴兴地去上班，晚上回来就失业在家了。所谓的<code>资本寒冬</code>大抵就是这个样子的，没想到，该来的还是回来，同一个公司的iOS同事到现在都还没有找到工作。我自己找工作也有点儿急，只要面试过后两天之内没有通知我就基本忽略了，没想到在答应了现在这家公司的第二天之前面试的公司就通知我去上班了，只能遗憾地放弃。想想，自己为什么会答应现在这家公司呢，大概的原因是老板很热情，真心没想到，最近发现是我对工作太没有热情了（手动加一个😓的表情），这就让我开始思考自己以后的人生究竟该怎么走的问题了。</p>\n<p>说到底，程序员算什么呢？现在的技术经理是一个<code>不懂得开发的人</code>，在他眼里，技术是解决问题的，不管你用什么东西，只有解决了问题才是好的技术，这并没有错，我们现在用到的技术也并不是什么改变世界的技术，并不足以让我们用技术来换钱，这就是很现实的问题，任何公司都是以盈利为导向的，不然话，公司也就无法生存下去。讲道理，在我第一次提到需要时间去完善代码的时候，他说的一句话深深地打击了我<code>“代码够用就好了，你管人家写的好还是不好，哪怕你写的再好又能怎样，又有谁会看到？”</code>。是啊，这就是技术人员的悲哀，除了少部分创造出”有价值的”的人，大部分人终其一生都是默默无闻的小员工，没有话语权，没有成就，属于可替代品。我呢？除了完善自己的技术能力以外，我还有什么呢？我的工作是属于可替代的，兴许别人比我做的还要好，我对自己如何定位呢？思考了好久，发现自己无法得到合理的答案，我只能送自己一句话：“完成现阶段作为程序员的主要职责，然后保持适度的技术好奇心，再去拓展其他方面的技能。”，再加一句：“Read the fucking source code.”。</p>\n<p>既然写到这里了，顺便提下自己的感情状况吧。今年七月中旬的时候，和前尘去湖南旅游了一周，很久以前答应过她去湖南旅游的，而且我的确有些事放不下，所以毫不犹豫地就答应去了。因为是跟着旅行团走的，一路上就是各种赶路，在全程没有准备的情况下，我始终处于懵的状态。回来之后，我发现我终于放下了，时间啊就是这么残忍，当你迷茫裹足不前的时候，走到那个终点去看看就知道自己究竟想要的是什么了。哪怕我总是不遗余力地向前尘解释我那漏洞百出的人生观，在她眼里我依旧只是一个情商不高的傻子，三观不合何必强求，我不是情商不高，只是太自负了，这几年的打击才开始真正让我开始学会谦让。直到这一天，我觉得我终于遇到了那个对的人，可是遗憾地发现，我不知道该如何去跨过这一步。</p>\n<p>又走过了一年，未来的计划应该是这样子：积累自己的素材库多把新的内容分享出来。好了，就这样了，期待有一个美好的2017年。</p>"},{"title":"Android共享元素","date":"2018-06-22T06:10:28.000Z","comments":0,"_content":"在这里记录一下android共享元素的方法，踩了满多坑的，其实蛮简单的，Android共享是从Android5.0开始提供的，之前的版本我没有去碰兼容，但是其实是有解决方法的。这里只是记录一下踩过的坑，不对共享元素做深入的分析。\n\n<!--more-->\n首先从页面A跳转到页面B，那么页面A只需要调用\n```kotlin\nActivityCompat.startActivity(context,

一定要保证你简历上的东西是真实，是你会的。\n\n  讲道理，有的人连自己简历上的知识点都回答的不完整，遇到几个简历上写的精通Java，可是却连最基本的Java基础的集合都讲不清楚，实在是不知道那里来的勇气写精通的。对于筛选你来面试的人，一定是觉得你简历合适的，可是如果你乱写，浪费大家时间，你也辛苦白跑一趟，何必呢？\n- 请仔细检查自己简历里面的大小写拼写以及错误。\n\n

的序列化和反序列化：\n<!--more-->\n```java\npublic class ResultDeserializer implements JsonDeserializer<BaseResult> {\n    @Override\n    public BaseResult deserialize(JsonElement json, Type typeOfT, JsonDeserializationContext context) throws JsonParseException {\n        JsonObject obj = json.getAsJsonObject();\n        //下面添加你要做的事情\n        if (obj.get(\"result\") != null) {\n            if (obj.get(\"result\").isJsonObject() && obj.getAsJsonObject(\"result\").has(\"message\") && obj.getAsJsonObject(\"result\").entrySet().size() == 1) {\n                obj.getAsJsonObject(\"result\").remove(\"message\");\n            }\n            if (obj.get(\"result\").toString().equals(\"{}\")) {\n                obj.remove(\"result\");\n            }\n        }\n\n        BaseResult baseResult = new Gson().fromJson(json, typeOfT);\n        if (obj.has(\"success\")&&obj.get(\"success\").getAsString().equals(\"true\")) {\n            baseResult.setSuccess(true);\n        } else {\n            baseResult.setSuccess(false);\n        }\n        if (obj.isJsonNull()) {\n            baseResult.setSuccess(false);\n        }\n        baseResult.setErrorcode(obj.has(\"errorcode\") ? obj.get(\"errorcode\").getAsString() : \"\");\n        baseResult.setErrorcode(obj.has(\"error\") ? obj.get(\"errorcode\").getAsString() : \"\");\n        return baseResult;\n    }\n}\n```\n然后注册一下这个typeadapter\n```java\nGson gson=new GsonBuilder()\n      .registerTypeAdapter(BaseResult.class, new ResultDeserializer())\n

连接到mysql数据库\n\n在这之前先安装正确的npm包：\n```JavaScript\n    npm install mysql\n```\n**mysql** 是一个非常容易使用的模块，它提供了你可能需要的所有功能。安装好后，你需要连接数据库的方法是：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n\nvar connection = mysql.createConnection({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  user: 'your_user',\n  password: 'some_secret',\n  database: 'database'\n})\n\nconnection.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) throw err\n  console.log('You are now connected...')\n})\n```\n<!--more-->\n现在，你可以读写你的数据库了。\n\n## 读写mysql数据库\n\n你已经知道如何去连接你的数据库了，现在让我们看一个简单的例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n\nvar connection = mysql.createConnection({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  user: 'your_user',\n  password: 'some_secret',\n  database: 'database'\n})\n\nconnection.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) throw err\n  console.log('You are now connected...')\n\n  connection.query('CREATE TABLE people(id int primary key, name varchar(255), age int, address text)', function(err, result) {\n    if (err) throw err\n    connection.query('INSERT INTO people (name, age, address) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', ['Larry', '41', 'California, USA'], function(err, result) {\n      if (err) throw err\n      connection.query('SELECT * FROM people', function(err, results) {\n        if (err) throw err\n        console.log(results[0].id)\n        console.log(results[0].name)\n        console.log(results[0].age)\n        console.log(results[0].address)\n      })\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n你能够看到在上面的占位符`?`，它不仅仅使使用起来更容易，而且也是安全的。\n\n## 更换你的 *db.js* 文件\n\n虽然你看到的mysql模块非常容易，但是真实的应用有着更加复杂的需求。这就是为什么在[Connecting and Working with MongoDB](https://www.terlici.com/2015/04/03/mongodb-node-express.html)中，我们创建一个分开的文件db.js来帮助我们管理我们的连接。\n它的作用是无论何时我们不用经常键入凭证来很容易地连接数据库。它的第二个目标就是很容易运行测试。\n\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n  , async = require('async')\n\nvar PRODUCTION_DB = 'app_prod_database'\n  , TEST_DB = 'app_test_database'\n\nexports.MODE_TEST = 'mode_test'\nexports.MODE_PRODUCTION = 'mode_production'\n\nvar state = {\n  pool: null,\n  mode: null,\n}\n\nexports.connect = function(mode, done) {\n  state.pool = mysql.createPool({\n    host: 'localhost',\n    user: 'your_user',\n    password: 'some_secret',\n    database: mode === exports.MODE_PRODUCTION ? PRODUCTION_DB : TEST_DB\n  })\n\n  state.mode = mode\n  done()\n}\n\nexports.get = function() {\n  return state.pool\n}\n\nexports.fixtures = function(data) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  var names = Object.keys(data.tables)\n  async.each(names, function(name, cb) {\n    async.each(data.tables[name], function(row, cb) {\n      var keys = Object.keys(row)\n        , values = keys.map(function(key) { return \"'\" + row[key] + \"'\" })\n\n      pool.query('INSERT INTO ' + name + ' (' + keys.join(',') + ') VALUES (' + values.join(',') + ')', cb)\n    }, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n\nexports.drop = function(tables, done) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  async.each(tables, function(name, cb) {\n    pool.query('DELETE * FROM ' + name, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n```\n这个db.js有点儿比我们之前的要复杂的多。\n\n首先，它提供一种方法去连接数据库。在生产模块和测试模块都能\n去连接。测试模块仅在自动化测试时运行。\n\n然后，有一个`get`方法能够一直提供给你有效的连接，也可以用来查询数据库。而且，你可以去设置密码，其他模块也可以调用这个方法。\n\n最后，有两个方法`fixtures`和`drop`，很容易地去退出测试。\n\n**drop** 清空数据，它将会帮助你的测试数据库在测试之前总是空的。\n\n**fixtures** 使用json对象，加载数据库中的数据，看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar data = {\n  tables: {\n    people: [\n     {id: 1, name: \"John\", age: 32},\n     {id: 2, name: \"Peter\", age: 29},\n    ],\n    cars: [\n      {id: 1, brand: \"Jeep\", model: \"Cherokee\", owner_id: 2},\n      {id: 2, brand: \"BMW\", model: \"X5\", owner_id: 2},\n      {id: 3, brand: \"Volkswagen\", model: \"Polo\", owner_id: 1},\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nvar db = require('./db')\ndb.connect(db.MODE_PRODUCTION, function() {\n  db.fixtures(data, function(err) {\n    if (err) return console.log(err)\n    console.log('Data has been loaded...')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## 使用SQL搭建模块\n\n所有事情准备好了，接下来看看如何在你的应用中使用db.js。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\ncontrollers/\n  comments.js\n  users.js\nmodels/\n  comment.js\n  user.js\nviews/\napp.js\ndb.js\npackage.json\n```\n**app.js** 是应用的入口，也是我们将要设置数据库连接的地方。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('./db')\n\napp.use('/comments', require('./controllers/comments'))\napp.use('/users', require('./controllers/users'))\n\n// Connect to MySQL on start\ndb.connect(db.MODE_PRODUCTION, function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log('Unable to connect to MySQL.')\n    process.exit(1)\n  } else {\n    app.listen(3000, function() {\n      console.log('Listening on port 3000...')\n    })\n  }\n})\n```\n你的应用将会通过这个模块来与数据库交互。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('../db.js')\n\nexports.create = function(userId, text, done) {\n  var values = [userId, text, new Date().toISOString()]\n\n  db.get().query('INSERT INTO comments (user_id, text, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?)', values, function(err, result) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, result.insertId)\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAll = function(done) {\n  db.get().query('SELECT * FROM comments', function (err, rows) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, rows)\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAllByUser = function(userId, done) {\n  db.get().query('SELECT * FROM comments WHERE user_id = ?', userId, function (err, rows) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, rows)\n  })\n}\n```\n正如你看到的db.js是你完全不用带薪连接数据库的问题，甚至不用只用是否是生产环境还是测试环境。\n\n## 为读和写使用不一样的实例\n\n随着你的应用需求的增长，今天，很多应用都是面向读的。这就意味着，人们读数据少于写数据。例如，所有这一类应用的社交网站，通常你的状态只被读一次，但是然后被成千上万的人去读。在这种情况下是通常有一个主要的数据库将接受所有的写,然后同步到一些MySQL实例将只读取请求。当你有更多的用户可以很容易地添加更多数据库去读，你的应用将仍然是非常快的。\n\n但是，如何在我们的初始化中解决这个问题呢？mysql模块 **PoolCluster** 特性非常有用,它可以配置几个实例,然后连接到所有的人。看一个db.js中的例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n  , async = require('async')\n\nvar PRODUCTION_DB = 'app_prod_database'\n  , TEST_DB = 'app_test_database'\n\nexports.MODE_TEST = 'mode_test'\nexports.MODE_PRODUCTION = 'mode_production'\n\nvar state = {\n  pool: null,\n  mode: null,\n}\n\nexports.connect = function(mode, done) {\n  if (mode === exports.MODE_PRODUCTION) {\n    state.pool = mysql.createPoolCluster()\n\n    state.pool.add('WRITE', {\n      host: '192.168.0.5',\n      user: 'your_user',\n      password: 'some_secret',\n      database: PRODUCTION_DB\n    })\n\n    state.pool.add('READ1', {\n      host: '192.168.0.6',\n      user: 'your_user',\n      password: 'some_secret',\n      database: PRODUCTION_DB\n    })\n\n    state.pool.add('READ2', {\n      host: '192.168.0.7',\n      user: 'your_user',\n      password: 'some_secret',\n      database: PRODUCTION_DB\n    })\n  } else {\n    state.pool = mysql.createPool({\n      host: 'localhost',\n      user: 'your_user',\n      password: 'some_secret',\n      database: TEST_DB\n    })\n  }\n\n  state.mode = mode\n  done()\n}\n\nexports.READ = 'read'\nexports.WRITE = 'write'\n\nexports.get = function(type, done) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  if (type === exports.WRITE) {\n    state.pool.getConnection('WRITE', function (err, connection) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, connection)\n    })\n  } else {\n    state.pool.getConnection('READ*', function (err, connection) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, connection)\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nexports.fixtures = function(data) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  var names = Object.keys(data.tables)\n  async.each(names, function(name, cb) {\n    async.each(data.tables[name], function(row, cb) {\n      var keys = Object.keys(row)\n        , values = keys.map(function(key) { return \"'\" + row[key] + \"'\" })\n\n      pool.query('INSERT INTO ' + name + ' (' + keys.join(',') + ') VALUES (' + values.join(',') + ')', cb)\n    }, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n\nexports.drop = function(tables, done) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  async.each(tables, function(name, cb) {\n    pool.query('DELETE * FROM ' + name, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n```\n这里有三处和之前的不一样。\n\n1. 当连接在连接方法在测试模式下,做你之前所做的。然而,当你在生产模式下,添加3个更多的servers。每一个server都有一个名字，第一个是`WRITE`，另外两个是`READ1`和`READ2`。应该很清楚每一个的目的是什么。`READ1`和`READ2`是`WRITE`的奴隶,所以每次有人写数据到`WRITE`,然后很快地对`READ1`和`READ2`可用。\n2. 第二处变化是`get`方法。之前，它会立即返回一个连接。现在，它返回一个连接到回调函数作为第二个参数提供。\n3. 最后一处变化还是在`get`方法。在你连接数据库的时候，你需要告诉连接的类型 **READ** 和 **WRITE**。然后根据名称设置为服务器将提供正确的类型的连接。在这种情况下你可以看到`getConnection`提供一种模式系统,这样您就可以选择适当的数据库\n\n然后让我们看一个使用 **db.js** 的实例：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('../db.js')\n\nexports.create = function(userId, text, done) {\n  var values = [userId, text, new Date().toISOString()]\n\n  db.get(db.WRITE, function(err, connection) {\n    if (err) return done('Database problem')\n\n    connection.query('INSERT INTO comments (user_id, text, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?)', values, function(err, result) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, result.insertId)\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAll = function(done) {\n  db.get(db.READ, function(err, connection) {\n    if (err) return done('Database problem')\n\n    connection.query('SELECT * FROM comments', function (err, rows) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, rows)\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAllByUser = function(userId, done) {\n  db.get(db.READ, function(err, connection) {\n    if (err) return done('Database problem')\n\n    connection.query('SELECT * FROM comments WHERE user_id = ?', userId, function (err, rows) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, rows)\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n你也可以创建一个代理连接对象,基于可以查询了解这是一个写或读,然后选择适当的连接。这样你甚至不会改变你的模块。\n\n##

是一个非常容易使用的模块，它提供了你可能需要的所有功能。安装好后，你需要连接数据库的方法是：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n\nvar connection = mysql.createConnection({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  user: 'your_user',\n  password: 'some_secret',\n  database: 'database'\n})\n\nconnection.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) throw err\n  console.log('You are now connected...')\n})\n```\n<!--more-->\n现在，你可以读写你的数据库了。\n\n## 读写mysql数据库\n\n你已经知道如何去连接你的数据库了，现在让我们看一个简单的例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n\nvar connection = mysql.createConnection({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  user: 'your_user',\n  password: 'some_secret',\n  database: 'database'\n})\n\nconnection.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) throw err\n  console.log('You are now connected...')\n\n  connection.query('CREATE TABLE people(id int primary key, name varchar(255), age int, address text)', function(err, result) {\n    if (err) throw err\n    connection.query('INSERT INTO people (name, age, address) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', ['Larry', '41', 'California, USA'], function(err, result) {\n      if (err) throw err\n      connection.query('SELECT * FROM people', function(err, results) {\n        if (err) throw err\n        console.log(results[0].id)\n        console.log(results[0].name)\n        console.log(results[0].age)\n        console.log(results[0].address)\n      })\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n你能够看到在上面的占位符`?`，它不仅仅使使用起来更容易，而且也是安全的。\n\n## 更换你的 *db.js* 文件\n\n虽然你看到的mysql模块非常容易，但是真实的应用有着更加复杂的需求。这就是为什么在[Connecting and Working with MongoDB](https://www.terlici.com/2015/04/03/mongodb-node-express.html)中，我们创建一个分开的文件db.js来帮助我们管理我们的连接。\n它的作用是无论何时我们不用经常键入凭证来很容易地连接数据库。它的第二个目标就是很容易运行测试。\n\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n  , async = require('async')\n\nvar PRODUCTION_DB = 'app_prod_database'\n  , TEST_DB = 'app_test_database'\n\nexports.MODE_TEST = 'mode_test'\nexports.MODE_PRODUCTION = 'mode_production'\n\nvar state = {\n  pool: null,\n  mode: null,\n}\n\nexports.connect = function(mode, done) {\n  state.pool = mysql.createPool({\n    host: 'localhost',\n    user: 'your_user',\n    password: 'some_secret',\n    database: mode === exports.MODE_PRODUCTION ? PRODUCTION_DB : TEST_DB\n  })\n\n  state.mode = mode\n  done()\n}\n\nexports.get = function() {\n  return state.pool\n}\n\nexports.fixtures = function(data) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  var names = Object.keys(data.tables)\n  async.each(names, function(name, cb) {\n    async.each(data.tables[name], function(row, cb) {\n      var keys = Object.keys(row)\n        , values = keys.map(function(key) { return \"'\" + row[key] + \"'\" })\n\n      pool.query('INSERT INTO ' + name + ' (' + keys.join(',') + ') VALUES (' + values.join(',') + ')', cb)\n    }, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n\nexports.drop = function(tables, done) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  async.each(tables, function(name, cb) {\n    pool.query('DELETE * FROM ' + name, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n```\n这个db.js有点儿比我们之前的要复杂的多。\n\n首先，它提供一种方法去连接数据库。在生产模块和测试模块都能\n去连接。测试模块仅在自动化测试时运行。\n\n然后，有一个`get`方法能够一直提供给你有效的连接，也可以用来查询数据库。而且，你可以去设置密码，其他模块也可以调用这个方法。\n\n最后，有两个方法`fixtures`和`drop`，很容易地去退出测试。\n\n**drop** 清空数据，它将会帮助你的测试数据库在测试之前总是空的。\n\n**fixtures** 使用json对象，加载数据库中的数据，看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar data = {\n  tables: {\n    people: [\n     {id: 1, name: \"John\", age: 32},\n     {id: 2, name: \"Peter\", age: 29},\n    ],\n    cars: [\n      {id: 1, brand: \"Jeep\", model: \"Cherokee\", owner_id: 2},\n      {id: 2, brand: \"BMW\", model: \"X5\", owner_id: 2},\n      {id: 3, brand: \"Volkswagen\", model: \"Polo\", owner_id: 1},\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nvar db = require('./db')\ndb.connect(db.MODE_PRODUCTION, function() {\n  db.fixtures(data, function(err) {\n    if (err) return console.log(err)\n    console.log('Data has been loaded...')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## 使用SQL搭建模块\n\n所有事情准备好了，接下来看看如何在你的应用中使用db.js。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\ncontrollers/\n  comments.js\n  users.js\nmodels/\n  comment.js\n  user.js\nviews/\napp.js\ndb.js\npackage.json\n```\n**app.js** 是应用的入口，也是我们将要设置数据库连接的地方。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('./db')\n\napp.use('/comments', require('./controllers/comments'))\napp.use('/users', require('./controllers/users'))\n\n// Connect to MySQL on start\ndb.connect(db.MODE_PRODUCTION, function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log('Unable to connect to MySQL.')\n    process.exit(1)\n  } else {\n    app.listen(3000, function() {\n      console.log('Listening on port 3000...')\n    })\n  }\n})\n```\n你的应用将会通过这个模块来与数据库交互。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('../db.js')\n\nexports.create = function(userId, text, done) {\n  var values = [userId, text, new Date().toISOString()]\n\n  db.get().query('INSERT INTO comments (user_id, text, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?)', values, function(err, result) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, result.insertId)\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAll = function(done) {\n  db.get().query('SELECT * FROM comments', function (err, rows) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, rows)\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAllByUser = function(userId, done) {\n  db.get().query('SELECT * FROM comments WHERE user_id = ?', userId, function (err, rows) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, rows)\n  })\n}\n```\n正如你看到的db.js是你完全不用带薪连接数据库的问题，甚至不用只用是否是生产环境还是测试环境。\n\n## 为读和写使用不一样的实例\n\n随着你的应用需求的增长，今天，很多应用都是面向读的。这就意味着，人们读数据少于写数据。例如，所有这一类应用的社交网站，通常你的状态只被读一次，但是然后被成千上万的人去读。在这种情况下是通常有一个主要的数据库将接受所有的写,然后同步到一些MySQL实例将只读取请求。当你有更多的用户可以很容易地添加更多数据库去读，你的应用将仍然是非常快的。\n\n但是，如何在我们的初始化中解决这个问题呢？mysql模块

清空数据，它将会帮助你的测试数据库在测试之前总是空的。</p>\n<p><strong>fixtures</strong> 使用json对象，加载数据库中的数据，看一个例子：<br><figure class=\"highlight javascript\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span

L出现的新控件RecyclerView，把学习的过程都贴出来，便于日后查询。\n\n![Android L](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160416104439646)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nRecyclerView提供了四种配置：\n> - RecyclerView.LayoutManager\n> - RecyclerView.Adapter< VH extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder >\n> - RecyclerView.ItemDecoration\n> - RecyclerView.ItemAnimator\n\n##  **RecyclerView.LayoutManager**\n一共有三种布局，分别是：\n> - GridLayoutManager      网格布局\n> - LinearLayoutManager   线性布局\n> - StaggeredGridLayoutManager     瀑布流布局\n\n##  **RecyclerView.ItemDecoration**\n可以绘制特殊的RecyclerView的视图，放一篇参考文章<http://blog.csdn.net/lmj623565791/article/details/45059587>\n\n## **RecyclerView.ItemAnimator**\n动画效果，可以指定RecyclerView在添加删除Item时的动画效果。同样，放一篇参考效果\n<https://github.com/wasabeef/recyclerview-animators>\n\n## **RecyclerView.Adapter< VH extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder >**\nRecyclerView的Adapter相比较listview的adapter，强制把ViewHolder分离了出来，有几个方法需要重写：\n```java\npublic class RecyclerViewAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerViewAdapter.ViewHolder> {\n    private Context context;\n    private List<String> list;\n\n    public RankRecyclerViewAdpter(Context context, List<String> list) {\n        this.context = context;\n        this.list = list;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public RecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        View v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_layout, parent, false);\n        return new ViewHolder(v);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder, int position) {\n        viewHolder.textView.setText(list.get(position));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        return list.size();\n    }\n\n    public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\n        public TextView textView;\n        public ViewHolder(View View) {\n            super(view);\n            textView= (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.textView);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n有几个问题需要注意：\n> - layout中放的应该是`android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView` 不然会报错。\n> - `getItemCount()` 的返回值不能为空，不然不会执行`onBindViewHolder`\n> - RecyclerView必须指定LayoutManger，不然同样会报错。\n\n## **RecyclerView的点击事件**\n官方文档中并没有给我们类似ListView的`OnItemClickListener`回调方法，由于RecyclerView比ListView更高级，所以它并没有行或者列的概念，子View可以任意布局，每个子View处理自己的onClick事件，也就是说在Adapter中给子view的rootview设置点击回调。我们今天所要实现的是另外一种方式，类似ListView的`OnItemClickListener`的方式。通过文档我们知道RecyclerView留给开发者一个`RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener`接口，我们要做的就是实现它，实现点击的回调和长按回调。当然了，这种方式只是一个开始，我们还可以拓展为各种复杂的手势操作的回调。\n参考自：<http://blog.csdn.net/hlglinglong/article/details/44981889>\n```java\npublic class RecyclerItemClickListener implements RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener{  \n    private View childView;  \n    private RecyclerView touchView;  \n    public RecyclerItemClickListener(Context context, final OnItemClickListener mListener) {  \n        mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(context, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener(){  \n            @Override  \n            public boolean onSingleTapUp(MotionEvent ev) {  \n                if (childView != null && mListener != null) {  \n                    mListener.onItemClick(childView, touchView.getChildPosition(childView));  \n                }  \n                return true;  \n            }  \n            @Override  \n            public void onLongPress(MotionEvent ev) {  \n                if (childView != null && mListener != null) {  \n                    mListener.onLongClick(childView, touchView.getChildPosition(childView));  \n                }  \n            }  \n        });  \n    }  \n\n    GestureDetector mGestureDetector;  \n\n    public interface OnItemClickListener {  \n        public void onItemClick(View view, int position);  \n        public void onLongClick(View view, int posotion);  \n    }  \n\n    @Override  \n    public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(RecyclerView recyclerView, MotionEvent motionEvent) {  \n        mGestureDetector.onTouchEvent(motionEvent);  \n        childView = recyclerView.findChildViewUnder(motionEvent.getX(), motionEvent.getY());  \n        touchView = recyclerView;  \n        return false;  \n    }  \n\n    @Override  \n    public void onTouchEvent(RecyclerView recyclerView, MotionEvent motionEvent) {  \n\n    }  \n}\n```\n\n## **类似listview的`addHeaderView`和`addFooterView`**\n\nRecyclerView同样没有提供类似listview的`addHeaderView`和`addFooterView` 方法，不过我们可以自定义，参考文章：\n<https://github.com/dingdingyr/HeaderAndFooterRecyclerView->\n原理就是：\n```java\n\t\tGridLayoutManager manager = new GridLayoutManager(this, 2);\n        manager.setSpanSizeLookup(new GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup() {\n            @Override\n            public int getSpanSize(int position) {\n                return adapter.getItemViewType()? manager.getSpanCount() : 1;\n            }\n        });\n```\nGirdLayout可以设置显示的行数，我们可以根据我们要显示的Item类型来指定这个值。\n\n**还有一个问题，那就是在更新apdater的时候不推荐使用`notifyDataSetChanged()` ，因为`notifyDataSetChanged()` 会强制刷新整个视图，如果插入新的数据可以使用 `public final void notifyItemRangeInserted(int positionStart, int itemCount);`。**\n","source":"_posts/recyclerview.md","raw":"---\ntitle: RecyclerView\ndate: 2016-04-20 21:13:42\ntags: Android\ncomments:

**RecyclerView.ItemDecoration**\n可以绘制特殊的RecyclerView的视图，放一篇参考文章<http://blog.csdn.net/lmj623565791/article/details/45059587>\n\n## **RecyclerView.ItemAnimator**\n动画效果，可以指定RecyclerView在添加删除Item时的动画效果。同样，放一篇参考效果\n<https://github.com/wasabeef/recyclerview-animators>\n\n## **RecyclerView.Adapter< VH extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder >**\nRecyclerView的Adapter相比较listview的adapter，强制把ViewHolder分离了出来，有几个方法需要重写：\n```java\npublic class RecyclerViewAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerViewAdapter.ViewHolder> {\n    private Context context;\n    private List<String> list;\n\n    public RankRecyclerViewAdpter(Context context, List<String> list) {\n        this.context = context;\n        this.list = list;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public RecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        View v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_layout, parent, false);\n        return new ViewHolder(v);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder, int position) {\n        viewHolder.textView.setText(list.get(position));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        return list.size();\n    }\n\n    public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\n        public TextView textView;\n        public ViewHolder(View View) {\n            super(view);\n            textView= (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.textView);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n有几个问题需要注意：\n> - layout中放的应该是`android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView` 不然会报错。\n> - `getItemCount()` 的返回值不能为空，不然不会执行`onBindViewHolder`\n> - RecyclerView必须指定LayoutManger，不然同样会报错。\n\n## **RecyclerView的点击事件**\n官方文档中并没有给我们类似ListView的`OnItemClickListener`回调方法，由于RecyclerView比ListView更高级，所以它并没有行或者列的概念，子View可以任意布局，每个子View处理自己的onClick事件，也就是说在Adapter中给子view的rootview设置点击回调。我们今天所要实现的是另外一种方式，类似ListView的`OnItemClickListener`的方式。通过文档我们知道RecyclerView留给开发者一个`RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener`接口，我们要做的就是实现它，实现点击的回调和长按回调。当然了，这种方式只是一个开始，我们还可以拓展为各种复杂的手势操作的回调。\n参考自：<http://blog.csdn.net/hlglinglong/article/details/44981889>\n```java\npublic class RecyclerItemClickListener implements RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener{  \n    private View childView;  \n    private RecyclerView touchView;  \n    public RecyclerItemClickListener(Context context, final OnItemClickListener mListener) {  \n        mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(context, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener(){  \n            @Override  \n            public boolean onSingleTapUp(MotionEvent ev) {  \n                if (childView != null && mListener != null) {  \n                    mListener.onItemClick(childView, touchView.getChildPosition(childView));  \n                }  \n                return true;  \n            }  \n            @Override  \n            public void onLongPress(MotionEvent ev) {  \n                if (childView != null && mListener != null) {  \n                    mListener.onLongClick(childView, touchView.getChildPosition(childView));  \n                }  \n            }  \n        });  \n    }  \n\n    GestureDetector mGestureDetector;  \n\n    public interface OnItemClickListener {  \n        public void onItemClick(View view, int position);  \n        public void onLongClick(View view, int posotion);  \n    }  \n\n    @Override  \n    public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(RecyclerView recyclerView, MotionEvent motionEvent) {  \n        mGestureDetector.onTouchEvent(motionEvent);  \n        childView = recyclerView.findChildViewUnder(motionEvent.getX(), motionEvent.getY());  \n        touchView = recyclerView;  \n        return false;  \n    }  \n\n    @Override  \n    public void onTouchEvent(RecyclerView recyclerView, MotionEvent motionEvent) {  \n\n    }  \n}\n```\n\n## **类似listview的`addHeaderView`和`addFooterView`**\n\nRecyclerView同样没有提供类似listview的`addHeaderView`和`addFooterView` 方法，不过我们可以自定义，参考文章：\n<https://github.com/dingdingyr/HeaderAndFooterRecyclerView->\n原理就是：\n```java\n\t\tGridLayoutManager manager = new GridLayoutManager(this, 2);\n        manager.setSpanSizeLookup(new GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup() {\n            @Override\n            public int getSpanSize(int position) {\n                return adapter.getItemViewType()? manager.getSpanCount() : 1;\n            }\n        });\n```\nGirdLayout可以设置显示的行数，我们可以根据我们要显示的Item类型来指定这个值。\n\n**还有一个问题，那就是在更新apdater的时候不推荐使用`notifyDataSetChanged()` ，因为`notifyDataSetChanged()` 会强制刷新整个视图，如果插入新的数据可以使用 `public final void notifyItemRangeInserted(int positionStart, int itemCount);`。**\n","slug":"recyclerview","published":1,"updated":"2019-03-06T07:22:12.790Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck9met65c0015sltp3cbbtm3z","content":"<p>最新在项目中使用了Android

href=\"#RecyclerView的点击事件\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"RecyclerView的点击事件\"></a><strong>RecyclerView的点击事件</strong></h2><p>官方文档中并没有给我们类似ListView的<code>OnItemClickListener</code>回调方法，由于RecyclerView比ListView更高级，所以它并没有行或者列的概念，子View可以任意布局，每个子View处理自己的onClick事件，也就是说在Adapter中给子view的rootview设置点击回调。我们今天所要实现的是另外一种方式，类似ListView的<code>OnItemClickListener</code>的方式。通过文档我们知道RecyclerView留给开发者一个<code>RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener</code>接口，我们要做的就是实现它，实现点击的回调和长按回调。当然了，这种方式只是一个开始，我们还可以拓展为各种复杂的手势操作的回调。<br>参考自：<a

 摘抄\n1. 人类的心智并不是一台计算机，生来就是用于储藏海量信息的。我们的心智经过演化成为一个懂得灵活变通的问题解决专家，学会只提取最有用的信息并举一反三地应用于新情势，引导我们做出决定。于是，个人极少耗费大脑资源储存细枝末节的信息。\n2. 只有在你能通过因果机制的推理足以看到未来社会变迁的时候，比如当你看到死亡的威胁近在眼前时，才会花时间学习某项有用的技能或者工艺。\n3. 由因导果时人们会忽略其他潜在因素，是因为他们的心理模拟已经应接不暇了，但逆向地由果导因时，我们根本无法进行心理模拟。（即，由因导果时预测式的正向推理，由果导因是诊断式的逆向推理）\n4. 反事实的思考能力使得人们能够同时做出非凡和平凡的行为。\n5. 心理学家指出，故事构建了我们从个体自我到集体成员的身份认同。我们讲述关于过去的故事，我们追忆往昔并赋予它们浪漫色彩。我们讲述关于未来的故事，我们畅想未来并赋予它们奇幻色彩。我们还讲诉关于现在的故事，我们构建出自我并开始白日做梦。所有这一切都是关于挖掘原因和预见结果的。我们是怎么来的？我们要去哪儿？此时此刻，我应该采取什么行动？\n6. 故此，人们对任何东西都知之甚少（出乎意料，太出乎意料了）。事实上，我们知道的特别少，只是刚刚够罢了。\n7. 人们进门的时候也会用到光流。假设你想从门的正中央穿过，而不会撞到门框，一种方法是预测你与门之间的距离、门的宽度，并算好应以多大的角度从门中间穿过。出色的老式人工智能机器人就会这么干。这需要进行大量的计算和判断。如果你这位机器人时间有限，进行这类估算可能就心有余而力不足了。这里有个更快捷简单的办法：穿过门口的过程中确保两侧的门框以相同的速度靠近你（更确切地说：确保你两侧的光流是对称的）。仅此而已。如果你能这样做，你走进哪个房间都不会撞疼肩膀。而人们平日里就是这样做的。我们知道，事实就是如此，因为在利用虚拟现实技术创造的情境中，如果人为地提高某侧光流的速度，人们则不再走在走廊的正中间，他们将移步光流较慢的那一侧。\n8. 这些例子说明了心智的一项关键特质：其演化历程不是个体独自奋斗之路，而是群体协作的过程。连思维的演化都是彼此相依，结合在一起的。\n9. 人类的不可思议之处在于，至少当我们保持一致时，我们表征的是同一片小小的世界，即使各自持有不同的信息碎片。这反映了集体性知识的第二个特性：共同体中持有不同知识片段的成员之间必须能包容共存。\n 10. 知识的错觉之所以会发生是因为我们活在一个知识共同体当中，而且我们无法区分哪些知识是内化了的，哪些根本不在我们脑袋里。我们自以为那些有关事物运行规则的知识是印在自己脑袋里的，而事实上我们从周遭环境及他人身上获取了很多。这既是认知的特征也是认知的死结。我们知识库的绝大部分都存储于这世界和我们的社群里。多数人的理解力仅限于意识到知识就在那里。高级的理解力通常还包括知道可以去哪里获取知识。只有名副其实的饱学之士才真的把可用的学识存在他们自己的记忆体里。\n11. 这就是活在知识共同体中的代价之一：我们与那些只能通过他人的知识和体验而了解之事失之交臂。\n12. 人类是为技术变革而生的。我们的躯体和大脑生来就有将新工具融入日常活动的本领，仿佛它们就是我们肢体的延伸一样。\n13. 这引发了深度错觉：当我对个人理解力进行自评时，他人的想法也被纳入其中，因而，我对自己的理解力的自我评价比实际上更好。\n14. 因为技术并不了解系统所要实现之目标，它无法与人类共享意向性，总会出差错的威胁从未消失。当技术失效而人类毫无防备之时，灾难会随之降临。\n15. 在可预见的未来，技术将缺少一项促使人类成功的秘诀：共享意向性的能力。因此，技术不会成为知识共同体中人类的平等伙伴，它仍然是一个从属工具。\n16. 不止如此，当我们对知识共同体的利用到了游刃有余的境界时，世界上将有越来越多的专业知识随时听任我们调遣。\n17. 但是，如果人们在一开始对其机制就没什么头绪的话，对真相也就没那么抗拒了。\n18. 给出原因而非因果性的解释会导向完全不同的行为：受试者既没有降低对理解程度的打分，也丝毫没有要缓和立场极端性的意思。\n19. 我们不在乎某项政策的成败得失，其背后承载的价值观才是真正重要的。\n20. 因此，我们探讨的因果性解释对缓和立场是简单而有效的良方这一结论，只适用于某些立场判断基于后果而非价值观的特定议题。\n21. 理解的错觉源于人们对熟悉和识别这两个概念的混淆。\n22. 懂得留意你的未知，而不是盯着已知的部分。要想做到这一点，你必须放下一些傲慢身段，接受你对自己的未知一无所知这一点。找出你的未知，不过就是个关于你的知识边界在哪里，以及探求边界之外有什么的问题。\n23. 了解某人之未知的一个好办法，就是通过从事某个学科的实际工作来了解这个学科。\n24. 同时，这也意味着要教授批判思考的能力，促进沟通和意见的交换，而非仅盯着事实本身。这是一种自由教育的价值观，与你为了获取职业技能而进行的学习截然相反。\n25. 因为选项的鼓励与否操纵在别人手里。\n26. 应对未知比已知某些东西更有价值。\n27. 人际关系也与此类似：如果在相处当中遇到问题，我们自以为了解状况，这激励我们试着去解决问题。\n","source":"_posts/《知识的错觉》摘抄.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 《知识的错觉》摘抄\ntags: 随笔\ncomments: false\ncategories: 随笔\ndate: 2018-03-22

如果从学术上给社会分层下定义的话，可以理解为:社会分层是指社会成员、社会群体因社会资源占有不同而产生的层化或差异现象，尤其是指建立在法律、法规基础上的制度化的社会差异体系。\n<!--more-->\n2. 我们考察有文字记载以来的人类历史，还没有发现哪一个社会能够将人们的地位完全拉平；就是没有文字记载的社会，据称所谓“母系社会”“父系社会”，至少性别造成的地位差异也是显而易见的。\n\n3. 改革开放之前，是以“先赋因素”来确认人身份的身份制，比如户籍、家庭出身，严重限制了社会流动性。\n\n4. 社会结构是指社会各要素和各部分相互之间的一种比较稳定的关系模式或互动模式。\n\n5. 一般认为，从社会学家韦伯开始提出了三元社会分层的观点：即财产地位分层、权利地位分层和声望地位分层。其实，有多少种社会资源，就可以有多少种不同的社会分层或社会分层结构。\n\n6. 消除差异的公平观和地位准入的公平观。\n\n7. 我国社会分层现象的特点：\n>* 社会分层差异巨大\n>* 城乡分野\n>* 金字塔型社会结构\n>* 身份等级社会\n>* 官民社会\n>* 精英层的巨大作用\n>* 社会基础群体的重大社会功能\n>* 社会流动机制的特点\n>* 家庭纽带弥合社会差异的重要功能\n\n8. 伦斯基认为，社会结构、社会分层的核心问题是两个：第一，谁得到了什么？第二，为什么得到？\n\n9. 中国近70年资源配置的手段，政府干预、市场机制、权利的作用、单位的作用、老百姓的博弈。\n\n10. 乌坎事件。\n\n11. 起到缓解社会矛盾的机制：第一，基层组织的“缓冲机制。第二，传统单位体制的“缓冲机制”功能。第三，政治身份群体“缓冲机制”。第四，新的社会保障机制起到了缓冲社会矛盾的功能。第五，子女地位上升对父母地位下降的补偿功能。第六，家庭内部的经济互助，这是最具有中国特色的社会缓冲机制。\n\n12. 欧美发达国家社会分层演化的特点：第一，从传统的贵族与平民的身份制度演变为雇主与雇员的阶级分层制度。第二，农业劳动阶级的衰落和工业劳动阶级的兴起。第三，职业分层成为社会分层的基础。第四，白领阶层在人数和比例上均超过蓝领阶层。第五，庞大的中产阶级队伍的形成。第六，生产力的高度发展。第七，严格税收制度缓解了贫富分化。第八，社会保障制度使社会上绝大多数人都能享受到基本的福利。\n\n13. 帕金(Frank Parkin)，社会屏蔽理论。\n\n14. 有必要阐释一下什么是“身份”。在社会学上，马克斯·韦伯最早也最为系统地阐述了身份（ status）和身份群体（ status group）的概念。**韦伯认为:“身份”指的是在社会声望方面可以有效地得到的肯定或否定的特权**，它建立在如下一种或数种因素基础之上:a生活方式；b正式的教育过程，包括实际经验的训练或理性的训练，及与此相对应的生活方式；c.因出身或因职业而获得的声望。”①韦伯认为，身份与阶级不同，**阶级是由客观经济指标决定的分层体系，而身份是由主观社会评价决定的**。韦伯身份概念的复杂性在于，一方面强调了身份是主观社会评价上的地位，另一方面又强调身份有客观生活方式、教育、职业、出身作为基础。身份制就是建立在上述身份基础上的一套由法律、法规、规范认可的制度体系。\n\n15. 白领阶层和中间阶层形成的基本条件。第一，要有产业变迁的条件，即它一般形成于第二产业向第三产业转型的过程之中。第二，这实际上是一个职业变迁的问题。第三，和教育有关系。\n\n16. 改革开放以来中国社会分层结构的变迁。一，身份制的变迁。二，单位制的变迁。三，经济分层取代政治分层。四，社会中心群体与社会边缘群体关系的变化。五，新的社会阶层形成。\n\n17. “利益碎片化”的一个重要表现是，人们从过去的那种仅仅追求整体利益，转变为今天的追求个体利益。每个人都追求个体利益，这样，追求利益的方向就非常不一致，这样就形成不了整体的社会运动。社会就不会产生整体的冲突。\n\n18. ①［法］列斐伏尔（HemiTebwe）:《空间:社会产物与使用价值》夏铸九等编译，收录《空间的文化形式与社会理论读本》，台北明文书局，2002年版，第20-21页。\n\n19. “社区碎片化”引发的后果。\n>* 第一，社区之间的分化或“碎片化”，造成了社会关系的失衡。\n>* 第二，社区内部的“碎片化”，斩断了人们的交往，社区失去了共同体的意义。\n>* 第三，利益的“碎片化”加剧了社会矛盾与冲突。第四，权利的“碎片化”造成了管理的真空。\n\n20. 笔者以为，所谓利益群体，核心问题说的是“在物质利益上，地位相近的人所构成的群体”或者说在经济利益上，地位相近的人所构成的群体”。\n\n21. 知识分子是市场发展第一阶段政治地位上升最快的群体，从政治地位很低的群体上升为政治地位较高的群体。90年代以来，随着市场发展进入第二个阶段、知识分子又成为市场改革的经济上的获益者在这一阶段，与其他群体相比较，知识分子又成为经济地位相对上升较快的群体。所以，知识分子在市场转型的两个阶段都是获益者。在第一个阶段，知识分子获得了政治利益，在第二个阶段，知识分子获得了经济利益。因此，我们可以判断，知识分子是中国经济社会现代化改革中最为典型的获益群体。由此可以判断，知识分子会成为我国现代化改革的最主要的支持者。\n\n22. 当然，对于社会保障、社会福利制度与底层群体的关系，学界一直是有争论的。赞同推进福利保障制度的一派认为，社会福利、社会保障制度是现代社会不可缺少的制度环节，这样的制度对跌入底层的人群起到了救助作用，减轻了底层的贫困程度，使得他们不至于产生生存危机，最终有利于全社会的和谐。而批评福利保障制度的一派认为，奉行了多年福利保障制度的所谓发达国家也并未能消灭贫困现象，有时候，贫困甚至有所加剧，这是因为，福利保障制度只是貌似公允，实际上，它反而是造成贫困层之原因。这又可以分为激进主义者与保守主义者。**激进主义者**认为:“表面看来福利制度是济贫，其实，政府发放的福利、救济金数额较少，只能使穷人维持在贫困的生活水平上。这样，救济金实际上在制造着一个贫困阶层。这个阶层生活困苦，却由于保障制度而尚能存活。因此，福利制度阻止了穷人贫困状况的根本改善。”而**保守主义者**则认为:“福利制度之所以造成了贫困，不在于它阻止了社会制度的根本变革，而是因为社会福利、保障与救济的开支过大，它使社会再生产受到抑制，使投资减少，结果限制了财富与新的就业机会的增长，最终加剧了社会上一部分人的贫困化。”\n\n23. 最早提出“相对剥夺”范式的是美国社会学斯托夫（S. Stouffer他认为，“相对剥夺感”是社会不满和社会动荡的重要源泉。**“相对剥夺感”**是一种很矛盾的心理状态。此种心态的产生是由于，人们将自己的命运与那些既和自己的地位相近，又不完全等同于自己的人或群体做反向的比较。此种心态变得强烈是由于，人们所对比的群体变成了自己的潜在对手。社会学家默顿（R. Merton）则用“参照群体”（ reference group）的理论来解释“相对剥夺感”，**即关键是人们将哪一个群体视为自己的参照群体、同哪一个群体比较**。\n\n24. 贫困文化理论，刘易斯\n\n25. 中国社会的四个利益群体，即特殊获益群体，普通获益群体，利益相对受损群体和社会底层群体。\n\n26. 而笔者所说的“社会结构紧张是指社会结构的不协调，使得社会群体之间的关系处在一种对立的、矛盾的或冲突的状态下，或者说，社会关系处于一种很强的张力之中。在这样一种状态之下，社会矛盾比较容易激化，社会问题和社会危机比较容易发生。\n\n27. 所谓中产阶级理论，就是认为现代社会是一个中产阶级会不断扩大的社会。当中产阶级变成了社会上的多数人或社会主体时，下层阶级或低收入者就必然成为社会的少数人群体。这时，社会的一个重要特征是:它在结构上比较稳定。因为，**中产阶级往往对社会的主导价值观有较强的认同感，它往往起到缓解社会对立和社会矛盾的作用**。反之，当中产阶级在社会上仅为少数人时，下层阶级或低收入者的比例就必然较高。这时，一个社会在结构上就处于不稳定状态。因为，下层收入群体对社会的认同感较弱，而反社会的情绪却较强。再者，失去了中产阶层的缓冲作用，上下两层之间容易导致矛盾和冲突。\n\n28. 吉登斯的“统一的中产阶级”，认为从市场能力上，他们有很多相似性。K.罗伯茨，F.G.库克，等提出“破碎的中产阶级”，认为中产阶级是分化成多个阶级的。J.H. 戈德索普倾向于划分细小的阶层，也不同意有一个统一的中产阶级。\n\n29. 社会地位的基础要素，即经济地位、职业地位和教育地位。\n\n30. 笔者认为，在抽象理论研究的意义上，中产阶层的标准包括以下三方面:\n>* 第一，在经济上，该阶层的收入、财产状况以及消费和生活状况不低于小康水平；\n>* 第二，在职业上居于职业地位的中间层次，更具体来说，类似于白领阶层；\n>* 第三，在知识方面，受过较好的教育，一般达到中等以上的教育水平或者受过13年及以上的教育。\n\n31. 中国中产阶级的五个集团。\n>* 第一集团是最典型的就是中产阶级，即专业技术阶层，以及传统的知识分子阶层，其中少部分高级别专家属于更高的阶层。\n>* 第二个集团是各类管理人员，包括企业事业单位的管理人员和广大的干部阶层，其中高层管理者，CEO属于更高的阶层。\n>* 第三个集团是所谓“新中产阶级”，包括科技开发型企业家，国外驻华企业的中方管理人员，国有金融行业中的中高层管理人员，各类专业技术人员。\n>* 第四个集团是效益比较好的国有企业、股份制企业和其他经营比较好的企业、公司、单位的职工层。\n>* 第五个集团是大量的中小产业、中小工商业企业主和所有者。\n\n32. 书中关于收入中产阶级的定义为，城市平均人均可支配收入作为基准线，将基准线3倍一下的定义为“收入中产”，将基准线50%到基准线一下的定义为“收入中下层”，将基准线3倍以上的定为“收入高层”。中产阶层不等于中等收入群体，壮大中产阶层，需要增加老百姓的收入、调整产业结构、普及教育。第三产业是中产阶级壮大的主要就业领域，第二、第三产业内中产阶级已占较大比例，第一产业则存在精英流失的问题。\n\n33. 年轻一代正在崛起，依照数据显示，在大城市中年轻人明显比中老年组收入要高很多，在小城市中却相反。因为年轻一代受教育程度更高，从事的也是新的产业。\n\n34. 参考2014年北京大学“中国家庭追踪调查”第三轮全国调查（COPS)数据，以下指标五个全满足的只有0.26%，满足一个的家庭有42.66%，全都不满足的有22.29%。\n![](/images/WechatIMG12.png)\n\n35. 本研究发现，造成中国中产阶层发展滞后的原因包括:在整个社会财富的分配中，居民家庭收入占比偏低、社会贫富分化比较严重等。\n\n36. 在当前中国的场景下，决定社会地位的因素。第一，权力地位。第二，经济地位。第三，教育地位。第四，技术职称。第五，户籍身份地位。第六，家庭出身，尽管我们一再抨击血统论，但是，在社会生活中，人们很看重一个人的出身，这就是为什么一些自称出身于高级干部家庭的骗子能够屡屡得手的重要原因。\n\n37. 西南财大的“中国家庭调研中心”，认为**2012年中国城乡居民家庭年均收入基尼系数为0.61**。主持该调研的甘犁教授解释说是因为他们采用专门的调查方法，调查出了一些高收入户的真实的高收入数据。\n\n38. 北京大学中国社会科学调查中心公布的数据。该中心发表的《中国民生发展报告（2014）》，公布了关于中国财产分层的数据。**2012年中国家庭财产分布的基尼系数为0.73**，更具体地展示了不同家庭组占有财产的情况是，最高1％家庭占有全部财产的34.6％，最高10％家庭占有全部财产的62.0％，最低25％家庭占有全部财产的1.2％，最低50％家庭占有全部财产的7.3％。\n\n39. 社会是否稳定，最关键的，还是要使全体中国人的基本生活条件得到保障，要使这个民族多数人逐渐富裕起来。戴维斯(J.C.Davies)在他的J曲线理论有做阐释。\n\n40. 所谓市场，讲的是三个方面：第一是商品市场，第二是劳动力市场，第三是金融信用市场。\n\n41. 经济学更多强调效率，社会学更多强调公平，实际上，这是对同一个问题的两种不同视角的分析。在效率与公平的问题上，基本可归结为三大理论流派:\n第一流派是以《资本主义与自由》的作者米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）为代表的自由主义派别，他主张效率优先，主张充分的自由竞争，他认为只有充分自由竞争的社会才能够体现出比较高的效率，而只有很高的效率才能创造出更多的财富，人们才能获得财富的分配。所以他主张充分的竞争和自由，主张废除集中管理的社会福利事业。他把效率放在了首位。\n第二流派以《正义论》一书作者、哈佛大学教授罗尔斯（ John Rawls）为代表，他主张公平至上，他的正义论，含义是公平的意思，他认为如果不能做到使“不平等分配”对每个人都有利那么一切社会资源就应平均分配。以上是两种完全对立的理论。\n第三流派的代表人物是阿瑟·奥肯（Arthur Okun），他主张在效率和公平之间找到一个平衡点。公平和效率两者虽有矛盾的，但是在某些情况下，可以找到一个平衡点。奥肯提出疑问:所有的不公平就一定促进效率吗？他认为不一定，不公平太大，引起了底层工人造反，就既没有公平也没有效率了。反之亦然，比如主张公平就过分地对企业主克以重税，这样的结果往往造成企业主投资、经营积极性的下降，整个社会生产也会随之下降，最终使人们获得的收入减少这样在效率损失的情况下会损伤、破坏社会福利基金，最终也达不到公平。\n\n42. 社会学有一个“精英循环”理论。精英循环理论认为，社会应该有一种制度体系，把不具备精英素质的人淘汰掉，让具备精英素质的人脱颖而出,进入上层。富人集团不是坏事情，但是应该有淘汰机制，让有本事的人上来、没本事的人下去。\n\n43. 贫穷分为绝对贫穷和相对贫穷。绝对贫穷，比如贫困山区等等。相对贫穷，比如城市里的下岗职工。\n\n44. 最近对税收的分析显示，中国个人所得税的纳税大户还是普通的职工层。\n\n45. 社会分层之所以在近几年的中国引起关注，一是持续的社会贫富分化。二是“权利”因素在社会资源分配及其发展机会中，显示出其决定性的作用。三是自上而下与自下而上的社会互动中，一些新的结构要素被“再生产”出来，影响和改变着社会利益关系及社会变迁的走势。\n\n46. 对现阶段中国社会结构变迁机制及其阶级阶层结构变化的分析、解释，社会学界主要有四种不同的判断，第一种，是陆学艺教授任组长的“当代中国社会结构变迁研究”课题组提出的，可称为“层化论”；第二种，主要是笔者提出的“集团论”；第三种，也主要是由笔者提出的“碎片论”；第四种，是孙立平教授提出的“断裂论”。除上述四种理论以外，对中国社会分层机制中的一些重要问题，如阶级阶层关系的传递、阶层认知、性别分层等，一些社会学学者也提出了经相关实证研究初步验证了的一些命题，如“阶层关系双重再生产模式”“阶层认知的相对剥夺论”等。\n\n47. 仇立平对上海的社会分层研究中，以“职业地位”作为社会分层的标准，认为现阶段上海存在界限分明的五大社会阶层:\n>* 第一，上上阶层，以领导干部为主，包括私人企业主、外商代理人在内的职业群体；\n>* 第二，中上阶层，以办事人员或职员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第三，中间阶层，以各类专业技术人员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第四，中下阶层，以商业从业人员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第五，下下阶层，以工人、农民、居民生活服务业人员为主的职业群体。\n\n这五大社会阶层基本上是“金字塔型”结构。被调查者认同自己家庭属于上上层的占被调查者的0.5％，中上阶层的占5.6％，中间阶层的占52.7％，中下阶层的占35.8％，下下阶层的占5.4％。大部分人将自己的家庭看作是中间或中间偏下的阶层。来自《职业地位：社会分层的指示器——上海社会结构与社会分层研究》载《社会学研究》2001年第3期。\n\n48. 对工业化社会中的新中产阶层，在西方有关社会分层研究中并未形成统一的定义，这与“新中产阶级并未组成一个紧凑单纯的阶层”有关。然而，研究者一般均认为，他们具有如下一些基本的阶层群体特征:\n>* 第一，职业构成以各种工程技术人员、科学研究人员、包括政府雇员在内的各级政治和经济管理、技术工作者等的脑力劳动职业为主要成分；\n>* 第二，除少数高级政府官员和高层企业管理人员外，他们已形成了一个由“靠工资谋生”的雇佣劳动者组成的集团；\n>* 第三，他们的经济地位和政治待遇，一般来说明显优于体力劳动者——他们中的相当一部分人，都程度不同地拥有对劳动过程的直接控制权；\n>* 第四，他们的政治态度、生活方式、个人素养、行为准则以及价值观念，不仅和普通的体力劳动者有着明显的区别，并且在相当程度上影响着社会意识形态；\n>* 第五，他们积极参与社会公共事务，并对社会公共事务管理拥有一定的发言权及影响力。\n\n49. 李春玲教授认为“中产人群”不认可中产身份，即被学界定义为中产的人群，将自己认同为中下阶层和下层阶层的比例相对较高原因之一在于，高速的经济增长和急剧的社会变迁下，出现了一种社会心态，即极强的物质欲望追求以及由此导致的不满足感和缺乏安全感，这种心态使他们总觉得未达到理想的中产生活状态。\n\n50. 熊易寒通过对上海J镇的田野调查发现，中产阶级在维护自身权益时，更倾向于采用协商的方式而非依法抗争。为了降低政治风险，中产阶级采取“忠诚呼吁”策略，即以基层政府作为忠诚对象和潜在的结盟对象，以地方政府的政绩作为谈判筹码。这种全新的维权模式完全不同于依法抗争的方式。\n\n51. 郭巍蓉、王正芬通过把医生作为体制内中产阶级，从业者作为体制外中产阶级，投资银行从业者为依附于体制的中产阶级的代表，对三个专业技术中产群体的比较分析来探究体制位置对中产阶级的社会变迁观的影响。研究发现体制位置以“市场化程度”和“体制身份定义-利益获取形态”作为中间机制，导致了三个群体在对社会改革主要力量为何的看法、对社会未来的预期上，行为模式上的差异。按照“与体制关系”和“与体制的合作性”两个维度，将利益划分为四种类型，医生与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性较弱，带来的是委身型利益，他们对体制的态度很复杂；投行从业者与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性也强，带来的是寄生型利益，对未来的预期徘徊于乐观与悲观之间；IT从业者与体制是弱关系，与体制的合作性也很弱，带来的是独立型利益，这种利益事实上与体制无关。因此可以说，**体制位置是研究中产阶级的政治态度和行为的一个重要变量**。\n\n52.

我们考察有文字记载以来的人类历史，还没有发现哪一个社会能够将人们的地位完全拉平；就是没有文字记载的社会，据称所谓“母系社会”“父系社会”，至少性别造成的地位差异也是显而易见的。\n\n3. 改革开放之前，是以“先赋因素”来确认人身份的身份制，比如户籍、家庭出身，严重限制了社会流动性。\n\n4. 社会结构是指社会各要素和各部分相互之间的一种比较稳定的关系模式或互动模式。\n\n5. 一般认为，从社会学家韦伯开始提出了三元社会分层的观点：即财产地位分层、权利地位分层和声望地位分层。其实，有多少种社会资源，就可以有多少种不同的社会分层或社会分层结构。\n\n6. 消除差异的公平观和地位准入的公平观。\n\n7. 我国社会分层现象的特点：\n>* 社会分层差异巨大\n>* 城乡分野\n>* 金字塔型社会结构\n>* 身份等级社会\n>* 官民社会\n>* 精英层的巨大作用\n>* 社会基础群体的重大社会功能\n>* 社会流动机制的特点\n>* 家庭纽带弥合社会差异的重要功能\n\n8. 伦斯基认为，社会结构、社会分层的核心问题是两个：第一，谁得到了什么？第二，为什么得到？\n\n9. 中国近70年资源配置的手段，政府干预、市场机制、权利的作用、单位的作用、老百姓的博弈。\n\n10. 乌坎事件。\n\n11. 起到缓解社会矛盾的机制：第一，基层组织的“缓冲机制。第二，传统单位体制的“缓冲机制”功能。第三，政治身份群体“缓冲机制”。第四，新的社会保障机制起到了缓冲社会矛盾的功能。第五，子女地位上升对父母地位下降的补偿功能。第六，家庭内部的经济互助，这是最具有中国特色的社会缓冲机制。\n\n12. 欧美发达国家社会分层演化的特点：第一，从传统的贵族与平民的身份制度演变为雇主与雇员的阶级分层制度。第二，农业劳动阶级的衰落和工业劳动阶级的兴起。第三，职业分层成为社会分层的基础。第四，白领阶层在人数和比例上均超过蓝领阶层。第五，庞大的中产阶级队伍的形成。第六，生产力的高度发展。第七，严格税收制度缓解了贫富分化。第八，社会保障制度使社会上绝大多数人都能享受到基本的福利。\n\n13. 帕金(Frank Parkin)，社会屏蔽理论。\n\n14. 有必要阐释一下什么是“身份”。在社会学上，马克斯·韦伯最早也最为系统地阐述了身份（ status）和身份群体（ status group）的概念。**韦伯认为:“身份”指的是在社会声望方面可以有效地得到的肯定或否定的特权**，它建立在如下一种或数种因素基础之上:a生活方式；b正式的教育过程，包括实际经验的训练或理性的训练，及与此相对应的生活方式；c.因出身或因职业而获得的声望。”①韦伯认为，身份与阶级不同，**阶级是由客观经济指标决定的分层体系，而身份是由主观社会评价决定的**。韦伯身份概念的复杂性在于，一方面强调了身份是主观社会评价上的地位，另一方面又强调身份有客观生活方式、教育、职业、出身作为基础。身份制就是建立在上述身份基础上的一套由法律、法规、规范认可的制度体系。\n\n15. 白领阶层和中间阶层形成的基本条件。第一，要有产业变迁的条件，即它一般形成于第二产业向第三产业转型的过程之中。第二，这实际上是一个职业变迁的问题。第三，和教育有关系。\n\n16. 改革开放以来中国社会分层结构的变迁。一，身份制的变迁。二，单位制的变迁。三，经济分层取代政治分层。四，社会中心群体与社会边缘群体关系的变化。五，新的社会阶层形成。\n\n17. “利益碎片化”的一个重要表现是，人们从过去的那种仅仅追求整体利益，转变为今天的追求个体利益。每个人都追求个体利益，这样，追求利益的方向就非常不一致，这样就形成不了整体的社会运动。社会就不会产生整体的冲突。\n\n18. ①［法］列斐伏尔（HemiTebwe）:《空间:社会产物与使用价值》夏铸九等编译，收录《空间的文化形式与社会理论读本》，台北明文书局，2002年版，第20-21页。\n\n19. “社区碎片化”引发的后果。\n>* 第一，社区之间的分化或“碎片化”，造成了社会关系的失衡。\n>* 第二，社区内部的“碎片化”，斩断了人们的交往，社区失去了共同体的意义。\n>* 第三，利益的“碎片化”加剧了社会矛盾与冲突。第四，权利的“碎片化”造成了管理的真空。\n\n20. 笔者以为，所谓利益群体，核心问题说的是“在物质利益上，地位相近的人所构成的群体”或者说在经济利益上，地位相近的人所构成的群体”。\n\n21. 知识分子是市场发展第一阶段政治地位上升最快的群体，从政治地位很低的群体上升为政治地位较高的群体。90年代以来，随着市场发展进入第二个阶段、知识分子又成为市场改革的经济上的获益者在这一阶段，与其他群体相比较，知识分子又成为经济地位相对上升较快的群体。所以，知识分子在市场转型的两个阶段都是获益者。在第一个阶段，知识分子获得了政治利益，在第二个阶段，知识分子获得了经济利益。因此，我们可以判断，知识分子是中国经济社会现代化改革中最为典型的获益群体。由此可以判断，知识分子会成为我国现代化改革的最主要的支持者。\n\n22. 当然，对于社会保障、社会福利制度与底层群体的关系，学界一直是有争论的。赞同推进福利保障制度的一派认为，社会福利、社会保障制度是现代社会不可缺少的制度环节，这样的制度对跌入底层的人群起到了救助作用，减轻了底层的贫困程度，使得他们不至于产生生存危机，最终有利于全社会的和谐。而批评福利保障制度的一派认为，奉行了多年福利保障制度的所谓发达国家也并未能消灭贫困现象，有时候，贫困甚至有所加剧，这是因为，福利保障制度只是貌似公允，实际上，它反而是造成贫困层之原因。这又可以分为激进主义者与保守主义者。**激进主义者**认为:“表面看来福利制度是济贫，其实，政府发放的福利、救济金数额较少，只能使穷人维持在贫困的生活水平上。这样，救济金实际上在制造着一个贫困阶层。这个阶层生活困苦，却由于保障制度而尚能存活。因此，福利制度阻止了穷人贫困状况的根本改善。”而**保守主义者**则认为:“福利制度之所以造成了贫困，不在于它阻止了社会制度的根本变革，而是因为社会福利、保障与救济的开支过大，它使社会再生产受到抑制，使投资减少，结果限制了财富与新的就业机会的增长，最终加剧了社会上一部分人的贫困化。”\n\n23. 最早提出“相对剥夺”范式的是美国社会学斯托夫（S. Stouffer他认为，“相对剥夺感”是社会不满和社会动荡的重要源泉。**“相对剥夺感”**是一种很矛盾的心理状态。此种心态的产生是由于，人们将自己的命运与那些既和自己的地位相近，又不完全等同于自己的人或群体做反向的比较。此种心态变得强烈是由于，人们所对比的群体变成了自己的潜在对手。社会学家默顿（R. Merton）则用“参照群体”（ reference group）的理论来解释“相对剥夺感”，**即关键是人们将哪一个群体视为自己的参照群体、同哪一个群体比较**。\n\n24. 贫困文化理论，刘易斯\n\n25. 中国社会的四个利益群体，即特殊获益群体，普通获益群体，利益相对受损群体和社会底层群体。\n\n26. 而笔者所说的“社会结构紧张是指社会结构的不协调，使得社会群体之间的关系处在一种对立的、矛盾的或冲突的状态下，或者说，社会关系处于一种很强的张力之中。在这样一种状态之下，社会矛盾比较容易激化，社会问题和社会危机比较容易发生。\n\n27. 所谓中产阶级理论，就是认为现代社会是一个中产阶级会不断扩大的社会。当中产阶级变成了社会上的多数人或社会主体时，下层阶级或低收入者就必然成为社会的少数人群体。这时，社会的一个重要特征是:它在结构上比较稳定。因为，**中产阶级往往对社会的主导价值观有较强的认同感，它往往起到缓解社会对立和社会矛盾的作用**。反之，当中产阶级在社会上仅为少数人时，下层阶级或低收入者的比例就必然较高。这时，一个社会在结构上就处于不稳定状态。因为，下层收入群体对社会的认同感较弱，而反社会的情绪却较强。再者，失去了中产阶层的缓冲作用，上下两层之间容易导致矛盾和冲突。\n\n28. 吉登斯的“统一的中产阶级”，认为从市场能力上，他们有很多相似性。K.罗伯茨，F.G.库克，等提出“破碎的中产阶级”，认为中产阶级是分化成多个阶级的。J.H. 戈德索普倾向于划分细小的阶层，也不同意有一个统一的中产阶级。\n\n29. 社会地位的基础要素，即经济地位、职业地位和教育地位。\n\n30. 笔者认为，在抽象理论研究的意义上，中产阶层的标准包括以下三方面:\n>* 第一，在经济上，该阶层的收入、财产状况以及消费和生活状况不低于小康水平；\n>* 第二，在职业上居于职业地位的中间层次，更具体来说，类似于白领阶层；\n>* 第三，在知识方面，受过较好的教育，一般达到中等以上的教育水平或者受过13年及以上的教育。\n\n31. 中国中产阶级的五个集团。\n>* 第一集团是最典型的就是中产阶级，即专业技术阶层，以及传统的知识分子阶层，其中少部分高级别专家属于更高的阶层。\n>* 第二个集团是各类管理人员，包括企业事业单位的管理人员和广大的干部阶层，其中高层管理者，CEO属于更高的阶层。\n>* 第三个集团是所谓“新中产阶级”，包括科技开发型企业家，国外驻华企业的中方管理人员，国有金融行业中的中高层管理人员，各类专业技术人员。\n>* 第四个集团是效益比较好的国有企业、股份制企业和其他经营比较好的企业、公司、单位的职工层。\n>* 第五个集团是大量的中小产业、中小工商业企业主和所有者。\n\n32. 书中关于收入中产阶级的定义为，城市平均人均可支配收入作为基准线，将基准线3倍一下的定义为“收入中产”，将基准线50%到基准线一下的定义为“收入中下层”，将基准线3倍以上的定为“收入高层”。中产阶层不等于中等收入群体，壮大中产阶层，需要增加老百姓的收入、调整产业结构、普及教育。第三产业是中产阶级壮大的主要就业领域，第二、第三产业内中产阶级已占较大比例，第一产业则存在精英流失的问题。\n\n33. 年轻一代正在崛起，依照数据显示，在大城市中年轻人明显比中老年组收入要高很多，在小城市中却相反。因为年轻一代受教育程度更高，从事的也是新的产业。\n\n34. 参考2014年北京大学“中国家庭追踪调查”第三轮全国调查（COPS)数据，以下指标五个全满足的只有0.26%，满足一个的家庭有42.66%，全都不满足的有22.29%。\n![](/images/WechatIMG12.png)\n\n35. 本研究发现，造成中国中产阶层发展滞后的原因包括:在整个社会财富的分配中，居民家庭收入占比偏低、社会贫富分化比较严重等。\n\n36. 在当前中国的场景下，决定社会地位的因素。第一，权力地位。第二，经济地位。第三，教育地位。第四，技术职称。第五，户籍身份地位。第六，家庭出身，尽管我们一再抨击血统论，但是，在社会生活中，人们很看重一个人的出身，这就是为什么一些自称出身于高级干部家庭的骗子能够屡屡得手的重要原因。\n\n37. 西南财大的“中国家庭调研中心”，认为**2012年中国城乡居民家庭年均收入基尼系数为0.61**。主持该调研的甘犁教授解释说是因为他们采用专门的调查方法，调查出了一些高收入户的真实的高收入数据。\n\n38. 北京大学中国社会科学调查中心公布的数据。该中心发表的《中国民生发展报告（2014）》，公布了关于中国财产分层的数据。**2012年中国家庭财产分布的基尼系数为0.73**，更具体地展示了不同家庭组占有财产的情况是，最高1％家庭占有全部财产的34.6％，最高10％家庭占有全部财产的62.0％，最低25％家庭占有全部财产的1.2％，最低50％家庭占有全部财产的7.3％。\n\n39. 社会是否稳定，最关键的，还是要使全体中国人的基本生活条件得到保障，要使这个民族多数人逐渐富裕起来。戴维斯(J.C.Davies)在他的J曲线理论有做阐释。\n\n40. 所谓市场，讲的是三个方面：第一是商品市场，第二是劳动力市场，第三是金融信用市场。\n\n41. 经济学更多强调效率，社会学更多强调公平，实际上，这是对同一个问题的两种不同视角的分析。在效率与公平的问题上，基本可归结为三大理论流派:\n第一流派是以《资本主义与自由》的作者米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）为代表的自由主义派别，他主张效率优先，主张充分的自由竞争，他认为只有充分自由竞争的社会才能够体现出比较高的效率，而只有很高的效率才能创造出更多的财富，人们才能获得财富的分配。所以他主张充分的竞争和自由，主张废除集中管理的社会福利事业。他把效率放在了首位。\n第二流派以《正义论》一书作者、哈佛大学教授罗尔斯（ John Rawls）为代表，他主张公平至上，他的正义论，含义是公平的意思，他认为如果不能做到使“不平等分配”对每个人都有利那么一切社会资源就应平均分配。以上是两种完全对立的理论。\n第三流派的代表人物是阿瑟·奥肯（Arthur Okun），他主张在效率和公平之间找到一个平衡点。公平和效率两者虽有矛盾的，但是在某些情况下，可以找到一个平衡点。奥肯提出疑问:所有的不公平就一定促进效率吗？他认为不一定，不公平太大，引起了底层工人造反，就既没有公平也没有效率了。反之亦然，比如主张公平就过分地对企业主克以重税，这样的结果往往造成企业主投资、经营积极性的下降，整个社会生产也会随之下降，最终使人们获得的收入减少这样在效率损失的情况下会损伤、破坏社会福利基金，最终也达不到公平。\n\n42. 社会学有一个“精英循环”理论。精英循环理论认为，社会应该有一种制度体系，把不具备精英素质的人淘汰掉，让具备精英素质的人脱颖而出,进入上层。富人集团不是坏事情，但是应该有淘汰机制，让有本事的人上来、没本事的人下去。\n\n43. 贫穷分为绝对贫穷和相对贫穷。绝对贫穷，比如贫困山区等等。相对贫穷，比如城市里的下岗职工。\n\n44. 最近对税收的分析显示，中国个人所得税的纳税大户还是普通的职工层。\n\n45. 社会分层之所以在近几年的中国引起关注，一是持续的社会贫富分化。二是“权利”因素在社会资源分配及其发展机会中，显示出其决定性的作用。三是自上而下与自下而上的社会互动中，一些新的结构要素被“再生产”出来，影响和改变着社会利益关系及社会变迁的走势。\n\n46. 对现阶段中国社会结构变迁机制及其阶级阶层结构变化的分析、解释，社会学界主要有四种不同的判断，第一种，是陆学艺教授任组长的“当代中国社会结构变迁研究”课题组提出的，可称为“层化论”；第二种，主要是笔者提出的“集团论”；第三种，也主要是由笔者提出的“碎片论”；第四种，是孙立平教授提出的“断裂论”。除上述四种理论以外，对中国社会分层机制中的一些重要问题，如阶级阶层关系的传递、阶层认知、性别分层等，一些社会学学者也提出了经相关实证研究初步验证了的一些命题，如“阶层关系双重再生产模式”“阶层认知的相对剥夺论”等。\n\n47. 仇立平对上海的社会分层研究中，以“职业地位”作为社会分层的标准，认为现阶段上海存在界限分明的五大社会阶层:\n>* 第一，上上阶层，以领导干部为主，包括私人企业主、外商代理人在内的职业群体；\n>* 第二，中上阶层，以办事人员或职员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第三，中间阶层，以各类专业技术人员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第四，中下阶层，以商业从业人员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第五，下下阶层，以工人、农民、居民生活服务业人员为主的职业群体。\n\n这五大社会阶层基本上是“金字塔型”结构。被调查者认同自己家庭属于上上层的占被调查者的0.5％，中上阶层的占5.6％，中间阶层的占52.7％，中下阶层的占35.8％，下下阶层的占5.4％。大部分人将自己的家庭看作是中间或中间偏下的阶层。来自《职业地位：社会分层的指示器——上海社会结构与社会分层研究》载《社会学研究》2001年第3期。\n\n48. 对工业化社会中的新中产阶层，在西方有关社会分层研究中并未形成统一的定义，这与“新中产阶级并未组成一个紧凑单纯的阶层”有关。然而，研究者一般均认为，他们具有如下一些基本的阶层群体特征:\n>* 第一，职业构成以各种工程技术人员、科学研究人员、包括政府雇员在内的各级政治和经济管理、技术工作者等的脑力劳动职业为主要成分；\n>* 第二，除少数高级政府官员和高层企业管理人员外，他们已形成了一个由“靠工资谋生”的雇佣劳动者组成的集团；\n>* 第三，他们的经济地位和政治待遇，一般来说明显优于体力劳动者——他们中的相当一部分人，都程度不同地拥有对劳动过程的直接控制权；\n>* 第四，他们的政治态度、生活方式、个人素养、行为准则以及价值观念，不仅和普通的体力劳动者有着明显的区别，并且在相当程度上影响着社会意识形态；\n>* 第五，他们积极参与社会公共事务，并对社会公共事务管理拥有一定的发言权及影响力。\n\n49. 李春玲教授认为“中产人群”不认可中产身份，即被学界定义为中产的人群，将自己认同为中下阶层和下层阶层的比例相对较高原因之一在于，高速的经济增长和急剧的社会变迁下，出现了一种社会心态，即极强的物质欲望追求以及由此导致的不满足感和缺乏安全感，这种心态使他们总觉得未达到理想的中产生活状态。\n\n50. 熊易寒通过对上海J镇的田野调查发现，中产阶级在维护自身权益时，更倾向于采用协商的方式而非依法抗争。为了降低政治风险，中产阶级采取“忠诚呼吁”策略，即以基层政府作为忠诚对象和潜在的结盟对象，以地方政府的政绩作为谈判筹码。这种全新的维权模式完全不同于依法抗争的方式。\n\n51. 郭巍蓉、王正芬通过把医生作为体制内中产阶级，从业者作为体制外中产阶级，投资银行从业者为依附于体制的中产阶级的代表，对三个专业技术中产群体的比较分析来探究体制位置对中产阶级的社会变迁观的影响。研究发现体制位置以“市场化程度”和“体制身份定义-利益获取形态”作为中间机制，导致了三个群体在对社会改革主要力量为何的看法、对社会未来的预期上，行为模式上的差异。按照“与体制关系”和“与体制的合作性”两个维度，将利益划分为四种类型，医生与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性较弱，带来的是委身型利益，他们对体制的态度很复杂；投行从业者与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性也强，带来的是寄生型利益，对未来的预期徘徊于乐观与悲观之间；IT从业者与体制是弱关系，与体制的合作性也很弱，带来的是独立型利益，这种利益事实上与体制无关。因此可以说，**体制位置是研究中产阶级的政治态度和行为的一个重要变量**。\n\n52. 黄嘉文调查分析发现，当前中国的收入不平等会损害个人对幸福的积极体验。国民幸福感的高低并不取决于收入不平等本身，而是分配体系构建的合理性。\n\n53. 叶晓阳，丁延庆利用2011年首都高校生发展状况调查数据，发现在首都高校间出现了学生分层，来自社会优势阶层家庭的学生具有更大的概率进入精英学校。如果高等教育扩张使高德教育更具有“合法性”而非“效率”，进而带来教育质量的下降，那么，高等教育对社会阶层流动的促进作用将会削弱。1999年的高等教育扩张，**实际上削弱了高等教育对社会流动的作用，而强化了社会阶层的复制**。来自，《扩张的中国高德教育：教育质量与社会分层》。\n","slug":"当代中国社会分层","published":1,"updated":"2020-04-20T09:27:01.322Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck9met65g001esltpc4dj02sa","content":"<ol>\n<li>如果从学术上给社会分层下定义的话，可以理解为:社会分层是指社会成员、社会群体因社会资源占有不同而产生的层化或差异现象，尤其是指建立在法律、法规基础上的制度化的社会差异体系。<a

Friedman）为代表的自由主义派别，他主张效率优先，主张充分的自由竞争，他认为只有充分自由竞争的社会才能够体现出比较高的效率，而只有很高的效率才能创造出更多的财富，人们才能获得财富的分配。所以他主张充分的竞争和自由，主张废除集中管理的社会福利事业。他把效率放在了首位。<br>第二流派以《正义论》一书作者、哈佛大学教授罗尔斯（ John Rawls）为代表，他主张公平至上，他的正义论，含义是公平的意思，他认为如果不能做到使“不平等分配”对每个人都有利那么一切社会资源就应平均分配。以上是两种完全对立的理论。<br>第三流派的代表人物是阿瑟·奥肯（Arthur Okun），他主张在效率和公平之间找到一个平衡点。公平和效率两者虽有矛盾的，但是在某些情况下，可以找到一个平衡点。奥肯提出疑问:所有的不公平就一定促进效率吗？他认为不一定，不公平太大，引起了底层工人造反，就既没有公平也没有效率了。反之亦然，比如主张公平就过分地对企业主克以重税，这样的结果往往造成企业主投资、经营积极性的下降，整个社会生产也会随之下降，最终使人们获得的收入减少这样在效率损失的情况下会损伤、破坏社会福利基金，最终也达不到公平。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>社会学有一个“精英循环”理论。精英循环理论认为，社会应该有一种制度体系，把不具备精英素质的人淘汰掉，让具备精英素质的人脱颖而出,进入上层。富人集团不是坏事情，但是应该有淘汰机制，让有本事的人上来、没本事的人下去。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>贫穷分为绝对贫穷和相对贫穷。绝对贫穷，比如贫困山区等等。相对贫穷，比如城市里的下岗职工。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>最近对税收的分析显示，中国个人所得税的纳税大户还是普通的职工层。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>社会分层之所以在近几年的中国引起关注，一是持续的社会贫富分化。二是“权利”因素在社会资源分配及其发展机会中，显示出其决定性的作用。三是自上而下与自下而上的社会互动中，一些新的结构要素被“再生产”出来，影响和改变着社会利益关系及社会变迁的走势。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>对现阶段中国社会结构变迁机制及其阶级阶层结构变化的分析、解释，社会学界主要有四种不同的判断，第一种，是陆学艺教授任组长的“当代中国社会结构变迁研究”课题组提出的，可称为“层化论”；第二种，主要是笔者提出的“集团论”；第三种，也主要是由笔者提出的“碎片论”；第四种，是孙立平教授提出的“断裂论”。除上述四种理论以外，对中国社会分层机制中的一些重要问题，如阶级阶层关系的传递、阶层认知、性别分层等，一些社会学学者也提出了经相关实证研究初步验证了的一些命题，如“阶层关系双重再生产模式”“阶层认知的相对剥夺论”等。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>仇立平对上海的社会分层研究中，以“职业地位”作为社会分层的标准，认为现阶段上海存在界限分明的五大社会阶层:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>第一，上上阶层，以领导干部为主，包括私人企业主、外商代理人在内的职业群体；</li>\n<li>第二，中上阶层，以办事人员或职员为主的职业群体；</li>\n<li>第三，中间阶层，以各类专业技术人员为主的职业群体；</li>\n<li>第四，中下阶层，以商业从业人员为主的职业群体；</li>\n<li>第五，下下阶层，以工人、农民、居民生活服务业人员为主的职业群体。</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>这五大社会阶层基本上是“金字塔型”结构。被调查者认同自己家庭属于上上层的占被调查者的0.5％，中上阶层的占5.6％，中间阶层的占52.7％，中下阶层的占35.8％，下下阶层的占5.4％。大部分人将自己的家庭看作是中间或中间偏下的阶层。来自《职业地位：社会分层的指示器——上海社会结构与社会分层研究》载《社会学研究》2001年第3期。</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>对工业化社会中的新中产阶层，在西方有关社会分层研究中并未形成统一的定义，这与“新中产阶级并未组成一个紧凑单纯的阶层”有关。然而，研究者一般均认为，他们具有如下一些基本的阶层群体特征:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>第一，职业构成以各种工程技术人员、科学研究人员、包括政府雇员在内的各级政治和经济管理、技术工作者等的脑力劳动职业为主要成分；</li>\n<li>第二，除少数高级政府官员和高层企业管理人员外，他们已形成了一个由“靠工资谋生”的雇佣劳动者组成的集团；</li>\n<li>第三，他们的经济地位和政治待遇，一般来说明显优于体力劳动者——他们中的相当一部分人，都程度不同地拥有对劳动过程的直接控制权；</li>\n<li>第四，他们的政治态度、生活方式、个人素养、行为准则以及价值观念，不仅和普通的体力劳动者有着明显的区别，并且在相当程度上影响着社会意识形态；</li>\n<li>第五，他们积极参与社会公共事务，并对社会公共事务管理拥有一定的发言权及影响力。</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>李春玲教授认为“中产人群”不认可中产身份，即被学界定义为中产的人群，将自己认同为中下阶层和下层阶层的比例相对较高原因之一在于，高速的经济增长和急剧的社会变迁下，出现了一种社会心态，即极强的物质欲望追求以及由此导致的不满足感和缺乏安全感，这种心态使他们总觉得未达到理想的中产生活状态。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>熊易寒通过对上海J镇的田野调查发现，中产阶级在维护自身权益时，更倾向于采用协商的方式而非依法抗争。为了降低政治风险，中产阶级采取“忠诚呼吁”策略，即以基层政府作为忠诚对象和潜在的结盟对象，以地方政府的政绩作为谈判筹码。这种全新的维权模式完全不同于依法抗争的方式。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>郭巍蓉、王正芬通过把医生作为体制内中产阶级，从业者作为体制外中产阶级，投资银行从业者为依附于体制的中产阶级的代表，对三个专业技术中产群体的比较分析来探究体制位置对中产阶级的社会变迁观的影响。研究发现体制位置以“市场化程度”和“体制身份定义-利益获取形态”作为中间机制，导致了三个群体在对社会改革主要力量为何的看法、对社会未来的预期上，行为模式上的差异。按照“与体制关系”和“与体制的合作性”两个维度，将利益划分为四种类型，医生与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性较弱，带来的是委身型利益，他们对体制的态度很复杂；投行从业者与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性也强，带来的是寄生型利益，对未来的预期徘徊于乐观与悲观之间；IT从业者与体制是弱关系，与体制的合作性也很弱，带来的是独立型利益，这种利益事实上与体制无关。因此可以说，<strong>体制位置是研究中产阶级的政治态度和行为的一个重要变量</strong>。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>黄嘉文调查分析发现，当前中国的收入不平等会损害个人对幸福的积极体验。国民幸福感的高低并不取决于收入不平等本身，而是分配体系构建的合理性。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>叶晓阳，丁延庆利用2011年首都高校生发展状况调查数据，发现在首都高校间出现了学生分层，来自社会优势阶层家庭的学生具有更大的概率进入精英学校。如果高等教育扩张使高德教育更具有“合法性”而非“效率”，进而带来教育质量的下降，那么，高等教育对社会阶层流动的促进作用将会削弱。1999年的高等教育扩张，<strong>实际上削弱了高等教育对社会流动的作用，而强化了社会阶层的复制</strong>。来自，《扩张的中国高德教育：教育质量与社会分层》。</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"<ol>\n<li>如果从学术上给社会分层下定义的话，可以理解为:社会分层是指社会成员、社会群体因社会资源占有不同而产生的层化或差异现象，尤其是指建立在法律、法规基础上的制度化的社会差异体系。","more":"</li>\n<li><p>我们考察有文字记载以来的人类历史，还没有发现哪一个社会能够将人们的地位完全拉平；就是没有文字记载的社会，据称所谓“母系社会”“父系社会”，至少性别造成的地位差异也是显而易见的。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>改革开放之前，是以“先赋因素”来确认人身份的身份制，比如户籍、家庭出身，严重限制了社会流动性。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>社会结构是指社会各要素和各部分相互之间的一种比较稳定的关系模式或互动模式。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>一般认为，从社会学家韦伯开始提出了三元社会分层的观点：即财产地位分层、权利地位分层和声望地位分层。其实，有多少种社会资源，就可以有多少种不同的社会分层或社会分层结构。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>消除差异的公平观和地位准入的公平观。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>我国社会分层现象的特点：</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>社会分层差异巨大</li>\n<li>城乡分野</li>\n<li>金字塔型社会结构</li>\n<li>身份等级社会</li>\n<li>官民社会</li>\n<li>精英层的巨大作用</li>\n<li>社会基础群体的重大社会功能</li>\n<li>社会流动机制的特点</li>\n<li>家庭纽带弥合社会差异的重要功能</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>伦斯基认为，社会结构、社会分层的核心问题是两个：第一，谁得到了什么？第二，为什么得到？</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>中国近70年资源配置的手段，政府干预、市场机制、权利的作用、单位的作用、老百姓的博弈。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>乌坎事件。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>起到缓解社会矛盾的机制：第一，基层组织的“缓冲机制。第二，传统单位体制的“缓冲机制”功能。第三，政治身份群体“缓冲机制”。第四，新的社会保障机制起到了缓冲社会矛盾的功能。第五，子女地位上升对父母地位下降的补偿功能。第六，家庭内部的经济互助，这是最具有中国特色的社会缓冲机制。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>欧美发达国家社会分层演化的特点：第一，从传统的贵族与平民的身份制度演变为雇主与雇员的阶级分层制度。第二，农业劳动阶级的衰落和工业劳动阶级的兴起。第三，职业分层成为社会分层的基础。第四，白领阶层在人数和比例上均超过蓝领阶层。第五，庞大的中产阶级队伍的形成。第六，生产力的高度发展。第七，严格税收制度缓解了贫富分化。第八，社会保障制度使社会上绝大多数人都能享受到基本的福利。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>帕金(Frank

Friedman）为代表的自由主义派别，他主张效率优先，主张充分的自由竞争，他认为只有充分自由竞争的社会才能够体现出比较高的效率，而只有很高的效率才能创造出更多的财富，人们才能获得财富的分配。所以他主张充分的竞争和自由，主张废除集中管理的社会福利事业。他把效率放在了首位。<br>第二流派以《正义论》一书作者、哈佛大学教授罗尔斯（ John Rawls）为代表，他主张公平至上，他的正义论，含义是公平的意思，他认为如果不能做到使“不平等分配”对每个人都有利那么一切社会资源就应平均分配。以上是两种完全对立的理论。<br>第三流派的代表人物是阿瑟·奥肯（Arthur Okun），他主张在效率和公平之间找到一个平衡点。公平和效率两者虽有矛盾的，但是在某些情况下，可以找到一个平衡点。奥肯提出疑问:所有的不公平就一定促进效率吗？他认为不一定，不公平太大，引起了底层工人造反，就既没有公平也没有效率了。反之亦然，比如主张公平就过分地对企业主克以重税，这样的结果往往造成企业主投资、经营积极性的下降，整个社会生产也会随之下降，最终使人们获得的收入减少这样在效率损失的情况下会损伤、破坏社会福利基金，最终也达不到公平。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>社会学有一个“精英循环”理论。精英循环理论认为，社会应该有一种制度体系，把不具备精英素质的人淘汰掉，让具备精英素质的人脱颖而出,进入上层。富人集团不是坏事情，但是应该有淘汰机制，让有本事的人上来、没本事的人下去。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>贫穷分为绝对贫穷和相对贫穷。绝对贫穷，比如贫困山区等等。相对贫穷，比如城市里的下岗职工。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>最近对税收的分析显示，中国个人所得税的纳税大户还是普通的职工层。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>社会分层之所以在近几年的中国引起关注，一是持续的社会贫富分化。二是“权利”因素在社会资源分配及其发展机会中，显示出其决定性的作用。三是自上而下与自下而上的社会互动中，一些新的结构要素被“再生产”出来，影响和改变着社会利益关系及社会变迁的走势。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>对现阶段中国社会结构变迁机制及其阶级阶层结构变化的分析、解释，社会学界主要有四种不同的判断，第一种，是陆学艺教授任组长的“当代中国社会结构变迁研究”课题组提出的，可称为“层化论”；第二种，主要是笔者提出的“集团论”；第三种，也主要是由笔者提出的“碎片论”；第四种，是孙立平教授提出的“断裂论”。除上述四种理论以外，对中国社会分层机制中的一些重要问题，如阶级阶层关系的传递、阶层认知、性别分层等，一些社会学学者也提出了经相关实证研究初步验证了的一些命题，如“阶层关系双重再生产模式”“阶层认知的相对剥夺论”等。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>仇立平对上海的社会分层研究中，以“职业地位”作为社会分层的标准，认为现阶段上海存在界限分明的五大社会阶层:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>第一，上上阶层，以领导干部为主，包括私人企业主、外商代理人在内的职业群体；</li>\n<li>第二，中上阶层，以办事人员或职员为主的职业群体；</li>\n<li>第三，中间阶层，以各类专业技术人员为主的职业群体；</li>\n<li>第四，中下阶层，以商业从业人员为主的职业群体；</li>\n<li>第五，下下阶层，以工人、农民、居民生活服务业人员为主的职业群体。</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>这五大社会阶层基本上是“金字塔型”结构。被调查者认同自己家庭属于上上层的占被调查者的0.5％，中上阶层的占5.6％，中间阶层的占52.7％，中下阶层的占35.8％，下下阶层的占5.4％。大部分人将自己的家庭看作是中间或中间偏下的阶层。来自《职业地位：社会分层的指示器——上海社会结构与社会分层研究》载《社会学研究》2001年第3期。</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>对工业化社会中的新中产阶层，在西方有关社会分层研究中并未形成统一的定义，这与“新中产阶级并未组成一个紧凑单纯的阶层”有关。然而，研究者一般均认为，他们具有如下一些基本的阶层群体特征:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>第一，职业构成以各种工程技术人员、科学研究人员、包括政府雇员在内的各级政治和经济管理、技术工作者等的脑力劳动职业为主要成分；</li>\n<li>第二，除少数高级政府官员和高层企业管理人员外，他们已形成了一个由“靠工资谋生”的雇佣劳动者组成的集团；</li>\n<li>第三，他们的经济地位和政治待遇，一般来说明显优于体力劳动者——他们中的相当一部分人，都程度不同地拥有对劳动过程的直接控制权；</li>\n<li>第四，他们的政治态度、生活方式、个人素养、行为准则以及价值观念，不仅和普通的体力劳动者有着明显的区别，并且在相当程度上影响着社会意识形态；</li>\n<li>第五，他们积极参与社会公共事务，并对社会公共事务管理拥有一定的发言权及影响力。</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>李春玲教授认为“中产人群”不认可中产身份，即被学界定义为中产的人群，将自己认同为中下阶层和下层阶层的比例相对较高原因之一在于，高速的经济增长和急剧的社会变迁下，出现了一种社会心态，即极强的物质欲望追求以及由此导致的不满足感和缺乏安全感，这种心态使他们总觉得未达到理想的中产生活状态。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>熊易寒通过对上海J镇的田野调查发现，中产阶级在维护自身权益时，更倾向于采用协商的方式而非依法抗争。为了降低政治风险，中产阶级采取“忠诚呼吁”策略，即以基层政府作为忠诚对象和潜在的结盟对象，以地方政府的政绩作为谈判筹码。这种全新的维权模式完全不同于依法抗争的方式。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>郭巍蓉、王正芬通过把医生作为体制内中产阶级，从业者作为体制外中产阶级，投资银行从业者为依附于体制的中产阶级的代表，对三个专业技术中产群体的比较分析来探究体制位置对中产阶级的社会变迁观的影响。研究发现体制位置以“市场化程度”和“体制身份定义-利益获取形态”作为中间机制，导致了三个群体在对社会改革主要力量为何的看法、对社会未来的预期上，行为模式上的差异。按照“与体制关系”和“与体制的合作性”两个维度，将利益划分为四种类型，医生与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性较弱，带来的是委身型利益，他们对体制的态度很复杂；投行从业者与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性也强，带来的是寄生型利益，对未来的预期徘徊于乐观与悲观之间；IT从业者与体制是弱关系，与体制的合作性也很弱，带来的是独立型利益，这种利益事实上与体制无关。因此可以说，<strong>体制位置是研究中产阶级的政治态度和行为的一个重要变量</strong>。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>黄嘉文调查分析发现，当前中国的收入不平等会损害个人对幸福的积极体验。国民幸福感的高低并不取决于收入不平等本身，而是分配体系构建的合理性。</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>叶晓阳，丁延庆利用2011年首都高校生发展状况调查数据，发现在首都高校间出现了学生分层，来自社会优势阶层家庭的学生具有更大的概率进入精英学校。如果高等教育扩张使高德教育更具有“合法性”而非“效率”，进而带来教育质量的下降，那么，高等教育对社会阶层流动的促进作用将会削弱。1999年的高等教育扩张，<strong>实际上削弱了高等教育对社会流动的作用，而强化了社会阶层的复制</strong>。来自，《扩张的中国高德教育：教育质量与社会分层》。</p>\n</li>\n</ol>"},{"title":"《人间失格》中引用的《鲁拜集》-田原版","comments":0,"date":"2020-04-07T02:10:20.000Z","_content":"\n停止徒劳的祈祷\n扔掉让人落泪的一切吧\n来，干杯！只追忆美好\n别去想那些多余的烦恼\n<!--more-->\n用不安和恐怖威胁人的家伙\n惧怕自己的罪孽\n为防范死者的复仇\n不停在脑中算计\n\n昨夜，心因酒足充满欢喜\n清晨，相陪的只有悲凉\n是何等的奇怪，一夜间\n心情迥然相异\n\n请停止作祟的念头！\n

支付结果回调，实现一个``.wxapi.WXPayEntryActivity``(包名或类名不一致会造成无法回调)。如果不需要显示这个，直接finish就好了。\n```xml\n<activity\n           android:name=\".wxapi.WXPayEntryActivity\"\n           android:exported=\"true\"

如果是统一下单的时候有问题，请确认后台返回给你的订单号是否是唯一的，参数是否正确，sign的时候时候按照要求签名，微信平台填的是否是MD5签名，发起请求的方式是否为post，是否传送的是XML数据，如果是使用Retrofit发起请求，可以这样子：\n```java\nnew Retrofit.Builder()\n

再次相遇\n因为公司解散，我选择短期内出去走走，于是，一次意外的相遇就这样开始了。知道她在西安读研，但是很多年没有见过，我不能确定，我还能否从人群里把她快速的识别出来。在过去的时间里，我对她的了解也不是很多，自从高二文理分班之后，仅有的交集也就仅限于因为源于几个相同朋友圈的交流，慢慢地就只是变成了微信朋友圈里的一个人。\n\n再次相遇，一起约在了陕西省历史博物馆，那天她比我早到了会儿，确切来说，是因为我迟到了，多年未见，第一次相约就迟到了，该是给别人留下多坏的印象啊。我记得那天她穿了一件很普通的毛衣，没有穿外套，好像是黄色的，还好我们还能相互认出来，寒暄了会儿就没有什么可说的话了。这就是一次普通的久别重逢，那个时候我心中关于工作、关于感情没有一件能坚持下去的，也没有一件能够让我炫耀的，阴郁始终伴随着我的那段时光，于是沉默寡言就变成了我的标配，而且因为刚从华山上下来，在山上冻了一晚上，还没有完全缓过来，状态也算不上很好。\n\n然后，逛了会儿博物馆，意外地我突然想开玩笑，有一个我自己记得特别深刻，就是到了一个被人们投了很多硬币的地方，其实我蛮讨厌别人乱投硬币的行为的，我对她开玩笑说，“来，让我们把这些硬币拿走吧，偷走别人的梦想，正好坐公交要投币”。她就一直笑我中二，笑了好长时间，看着她在笑，我也跟着笑了起来。哪怕是我每年都要聚会的那帮朋友，我都好久没有看到别人很开心地笑了，也好久没有被人逗笑了，这便成了我对她的第一次深刻印象。是啊，这句话是那么的中二，可是她的反应却让我意外，意外的惊喜，意外的意外。\n\n然后一起去逛碑林博物馆、钟楼、鼓楼、回民街，在鼓楼上，相会加对方的网易音乐的关注和微博，在搜网易音乐的时候是可以直接使用手机号加的，但是我的列表没有直接出现她，哪怕我给网易开了通讯录的权限，依然没有看到她，这就很尴尬了，约出来的是一个连相互的手机号都没有的人，她直接补了一句“好尴尬”，我把这句理解成了化解尴尬的意思，我不得已选择直接去通讯录复制手机号，证明我还是有她手机号的。“好尴尬”，变成了一件小事，已经过去了，但是给我留下了很深刻的印象，因为一般的女孩子都不会直接说对方很尴尬这种话的，尤其还是好久没有相遇的两个人，即便很尴尬，也不会直接说出来，我把这种行为理解成了直接坦率，这便成了我对她的第二个深刻印象。\n\n人和人之间，需要发生多少事情才算是彻底了解呢？也许一两次，也许一辈子，不一而足，无法界定。她做到只是自己生活中的样子，并不是特意做给谁看的，但是于我而言，意义就多了起来。\n\n# 离别\n在和她再次相遇之后，因为她还要上课，所以我自己一个人去了兵马俑，回来的第二天，也就是留在陕西的最后一天，我去了她的学校。自从大学毕业之后，就再没有回到过大学课堂了，遇见了她的同学，她的老师，然后一起随便吃了一顿也就结束了在陕西的行程。唯一的意外应该是离开的时候，差点儿就赶不上离开的火车了，以及她们学校的厕所超级破，还不如我们村里面的茅坑。\n\n她是把我作为一个久别重逢的老同学来招待的，我也没有想太多，甚至中午的时候，她把我丢在一边跑去午休去了，是啊，那个时候谁会想到后面会发生那么多事情，也就是简简单单地一次相遇罢了，估计结束之后也不会有更多的交集，何必在意那么多呢。晚上我接到了我妈妈的电话，点名要吃凉粉，还被她吐槽。\n\n离别的来临，也没什么特别的伤感，也没什么特别的惊讶，蛮平淡的一天。但很意外地，离别的来临，我居然多了一丝留恋，说不清道不明，回味与遗忘开始有了冲突，故事也就有了开始。\n\n# 心结\n心结的答案呢？没有办法写出来，也无法知道写出来的究竟还是不是一个合格的心结。期待能够续写心结。或者说，这篇文章的第三部分，我不知道该怎么写，还是戛然而止吧。\n","source":"_posts/相遇.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 相遇\ntags: 随笔\ncomments: false\ncategories: 随笔\ndate: 2018-03-07

位置147\n此外，将行为视作一种功能的条件也被人们忽略了。对于好奇心，人们最终得出的往往是心理的解释。在日常交谈中，我们常常会看到这一点。如果我们问某人“你为什么要去看戏剧？”，他回答说“因为我想去”，我们很容易把他的回答当成一种解释。我们更应该了解的是他以前去看戏剧时曾发生过什么，他去看戏时曾听到或看到过什么，他过去或当前的环境中有哪些东西可能会促使他去看戏（而不是去做其他事情）。但实际上，我们往往会将“我想去”这三个字看成对上述这些问题的总结，而且很可能不会再去询问更多的细节。\n<!--more-->\n第一章行为技术 - 位置167\n内在人（innerman）的作用在于提供一种解释，但反过来，这种解释本身却不能获得解释。于是，解释便在他这里中止了。内在人不是过去经历和当前行为之间的中介，而是产生行为的中心。他的作用在于启动、开启、创造，这样一来，他便一直被覆盖着一层神秘的面纱，就像他在希腊人心目中的样子一样。因此，我们说，他是自主的——从行为科学的角度说，这意味着他是不可思议的。与之相似，还有外在人（outerman）的概念。\n\n第一章 行为技术 - 位置275\n科学是人类行为，与科学相对立的也是人类行为。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置317\n几乎所有生物的行为都是为了让自己摆脱有害的接触。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置325\n行为还有一个更为重要的作用，它能以另一种方式削弱有害的刺激。虽然它不是以条件反射的形式获得的，但却是一种不同的被称为操作性条件作用的过程的产物。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置341\n他们也可能是“有意”让人厌恶的——他们可能会为了某种结果而以让人厌恶的方式来对待他人。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置347\n厌恶性控制（aversivecontrol）\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置348\n如果有人以令人厌恶的方式对待一个人，直到这个人就范，那么，当这个人做出前者所要求的行为以逃开或避免这种令人厌恶的对待方式时，其结果就强化了前者的行为。不过，他也可以采用别的方式来逃避。另一种变相的逃避方式是攻击那些设置厌恶性条件的人，并削弱或摧毁他们的力量。\n\n第二章 自由- 位置362\n蓄意破坏和暴动骚乱常常是无明确指向对象或指向错误对象的攻击行为。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置391\n在约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒看来，“自由是指一个人能做他想做之事”。自由文献在改变实践的过程中发挥了重要的作用（无论是在什么时候，也无论它在其中发挥了怎样的作用，它都改变了实践），但它却把自己的任务确定为改变心理状态和情感状态。自由是一种“占有”（possession）。人逃避或摧毁控制者的权力是为了感受自由，而一旦他感受到了自由，能做自己想做之事后，自由文献除了提醒他要永远保持警惕以防控制者再次实施控制之外，或许再也推荐不了任何更进一步的行动，也指定不了什么东西了。\n\n第二章 自由  - 位置399\n工资则例证了另一种不同的原则：一个人若按某一特定的方式行事，他就会获得报酬，这样一来，他就会继续以那一特定的方式行事。尽管人们很早以前就已经认识到了奖赏所具有的有效作用，但工资制度的发展却非常缓慢。在19世纪，人们认为，工业社会需要一支饥饿的劳动力队伍。只有当饥饿的工人可以用工资来换取食物时，工资才能发挥实际的效用。如果减少工人对劳动的厌恶感——例如，缩短劳动时间，改善劳动条件——那么，即使报酬降低，也有可能让工人愿意劳动。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置412\n人们通常所说的条件性正强化物（conditioned positive reinforcer），使用后，往往会带来延迟的厌恶性结果。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置483\n还有一个例子是邀请囚犯自愿参加那些很可能有危险的实验——例如，新药物的实验。如果参加实验，囚犯便可以获得更好的生活条件或者减刑。如果囚犯是被迫参加实验的，那么，人人都将反对。但是，当囚犯受到正强化，尤其是当政府施行这种改善生活条件或缩短刑期的做法时，他们真的是自由的吗？\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置491\n自由文献中经常出现的两种观点清楚地表明了人们对于积极控制（positive control）的不确定态度。有人提出，虽然行为完全是被决定的，但一个人“感觉自由”或“认为他自己是自由的”总是要好一些。如果这意味着采取不会产生厌恶性结果的控制方式会更好一些，那我们或许会赞同；但如果这意味着采取不会招致任何人反抗的控制方式更好，那么，这种说法就没有考虑到存在延迟的厌恶性结果的可能性。第二种说法似乎更为恰当一些：“做一个意识清醒的奴隶（slave）比做一个快乐的奴隶好。”“奴隶”这个词澄清了我们正在思考的那些最终后果的实质：它们是剥削性的，因而是令人厌恶的。奴隶所能意识到的是他所经历的悲惨遭遇，而一种精心设计以致不会招来任何反抗的奴隶制度才是真正的威胁所在。自由文献意在让人们“意识到”这种厌恶性控制，但它所选择的方法却不能拯救快乐的奴隶。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置500\n尽管事实上一直是你 [教师]在控制孩子，但你也应该让 [孩子]相信，他一直是在他自己的掌控之中。没有任何形式的征服像保持表面上的自由那样完美，因为在这种征服中，你可以俘获意志本身。可怜的婴儿，一无所知，一无所能，一无所学，难道他不是任你摆布吗？难道你不能为他安排周围世界的一切吗？难道你不能随心所欲地影响他吗？他的学业和游戏、他的痛苦和快乐，难道不都在你的掌控之中而不为他所知吗？毫无疑问，他本应该只做他想做的事情；但他却只应该想做你想让他做的事情；他不应该迈出你没有预见到的步子；在你不知道他要说什么的时候，他就不应该开口。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置520\n如果不是因为有“一切控制都是错误的”这个毫无根据的概括，我们应该可以像处理非社会问题那样简单地解决社会环境的问题。虽然科技的发展已经让人们摆脱了环境所具有的一些厌恶性特征，但它并没有让人摆脱环境。我们承认我们依赖于周围世界这一事实，而我们要改变的仅仅只是这种依赖的性质。同样，要使社会环境尽可能地摆脱厌恶性刺激，我们并不需要去破坏环境或逃离环境，我们需要重新设计它。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置532\n任何表明一个人的行为可能由外界环境引起的证据，都似乎会对这个人的尊严或价值产生威胁。一个人的成就如果事实上是通过一些他无法控制的力量而取得的，那么，我们往往不会表扬他。我们可以在一定程度上容忍这样的证据，就像我们满不在乎地接受一些表明人并不自由的证据一样。当我们将艺术作品、文学作品、政治生涯、科学发现中的重要成就归因于艺术家、作家、政治家和科学家在各自的生活中所受到的“影响”时，没有谁会因此而感到非常困扰。但是，当行为分析提出的进一步证据表明，一个人之所以取得成就，几乎完全都是外界的原因，而没有他自身的原因时，这种证据及其所依据的科学便会遭到挑战。\n**自由是由于行为的厌恶性结果而引发的一个问题，而尊严（dignity）却与正强化有关。**\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置546\n我们往往会去强化那些强化我们的人，这可能是一种自然倾向，就像我们会攻击那些攻击我们的人一样。不过，相似的行为往往产生于许多不同的社会性相倚联系。我们之所以赞扬那些为我们的利益而工作的人，是因为他们继续那样做便会使我们得到强化。当我们因为某事赞扬某人，我们就确定出了一种额外的强化结果。我们表彰一个赢得比赛的人，是为了强调这样一个事实，即比赛的胜利有赖于他的行为，因此，胜利对他而言可能更具有强化作用。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置573\n我们之所以习惯于称赞那些过独身生活、将所属财产捐赠他人，或者在遭受迫害时仍忠于某项事业的人，是因为他们都有明确的理由可以做出不同的行为。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置576\n就像拉罗什富科所观察到的：“无论是谁，如果他的性格中没有为恶的力量，他的善就不值得称赞。除此之外，其他一切所谓的善都只不过是意志的懒散或软弱而已。”\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置578\n当行为明确受到刺激控制时，褒奖与行为原因的可见性之间的反比关系就表现得尤其明显。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置616\n我们通过让自己置身于通常只会引起无价值行为的条件，同时避免以无价值的方式行事，以此来夸大我们应得的褒奖。我们总是努力找出使行为获得正强化的那些条件，然后又拒绝做出那种行为；我们追求诱惑，就像在沙漠中行走的圣徒在附近安排美女和美食，借此将自己苦行生活的美德最大化。我们就像自行鞭笞者一样，在本可以住手时，却依然继续惩罚自己，或者，在本可以逃脱时，却依然屈从于殉道者的命运。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置656\n我们对于不理解的事物总是心生敬畏，因此，我们越不了解某个行为，就越可能羡慕它，这就不足为奇了。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置671\n我们所说的尊严之战与自由之战有许多共同的特征。移除一种正强化物是令人厌恶的，因此，当人们被剥夺奖赏、赞美或者受赞扬或赞美的机会时，他们也会产生相似的反应。他们会逃离那些剥夺他们的人，或者向其发起攻击，以削弱这些人的力量。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置711\n虽然从事危险、艰苦且令人痛苦的工作的人常常受人称赞，但几乎所有人都愿意放弃因做这些工作而获得的称赞。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置728\n我们因一个人的所作所为而给予他奖赏，意味着我们认识到了他的尊严或价值。而我们所给予的奖赏的量通常与他的行为原因的明显性成反比。如果我们不知道一个人为何会如此行事，那我们就会把他的行为归因于他自身。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置748\n惩罚一词通常仅限于由他人蓄意安排的相倚性，而他们之所以要安排这些相倚性，是因为由此产生的结果对他们而言具有强化作用。（我们注意不要将惩罚性相倚联系与厌恶性控制相混淆。厌恶性控制通常被用来引导人们以某些特定的方式行事，而惩罚性相倚联系则常被用来引导人们不以某些特定的方式行事。）\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置759\n惩罚被设计出来，是为了将那些难以处理的、危险的或者不适宜的行为从人的整个行为中清除出去。惩罚的设计基于这样一种假设，即一个人在受到惩罚之后，便不太可能再以同样的方式行事。但不幸的是，事情并非如此简单。奖励与惩罚的不同不仅仅表现在它们所引发之改变的方向上。一个曾因玩性游戏而遭受严厉惩罚的孩子，并不一定不会继续表现出这样的行为；一个曾因其暴行而锒铛入狱的人，也不一定在今后不再表现出暴力行为。被惩罚的行为在惩罚性相倚联系被撤销后，很可能会再次表现出来。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置768\n毫不夸张地说，受过惩罚的人在以后很可能会“为了逃避惩罚”而采取一些行为。他可能会为了避免受罚而采取不会受罚的行为方式，但也存在其他的可能性。其中有些逃避惩罚的方式是破坏性的、适应不良的或者神经症性的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置777\n或者将他人的行为解释为应该受罚，从而投射（projecting）他自己的倾向。他还可以合理化（rationalize）自己的行为，向自己或他人提供一大堆理由，从而使得本该受罚的行为成为不该受罚的行为——例如，他声称，他之所以打孩子，是为了孩子好。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置784\n一个经常因为易于动怒而受罚的人，在下一次动怒前可以先从一数到十。如果在数数的过程中，他做出攻击性行为的倾向降低到了可控的水平，那么，他就可以避免受到惩罚了。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置788\n惩罚性相倚联系还可以包括引导一个人去寻找或建构他在其中能够采取一些行为来取代受罚行为的环境。他会一天到晚忙着做一些不会受罚的事情，从而让自己远离麻烦，譬如坚持不懈地“做着其他一些事情”。（许多似乎不产生积极强化效果因而显得不合理的行为，可能具有取代受罚行为的作用。）个体甚至还可以采取措施来强化那些教导他不要做出受罚行为的相倚联系。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置795\n通过创造一些行为不易受罚的环境，人们便可以减少受罚行为。还有一种可以采取的策略是打破那些使得受罚行为得到强化的相倚联系。另一种策略是安排环境，使得行为在其中可以发生，但不会受到惩罚。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置854\n人们常常会告诉自己该做什么、不该做什么，但却往往忽略了这样一个事实，即他这样做，都是社会一直以来通过言语的方式教导他的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置874\n善就像尊严或价值的其他方面一样，会随着可见控制的减弱而增强。当然，自由同样也是如此。因此，善与自由往往密切相关。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置899\n一个人“打算怎么做”，通常取决于他过去做过的事情，以及在他做过这些事情之后所发生的事情。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置904\n**“只有自由的人才能为自己的行为负责”**，这一观点有两层含义，要看我们是对自由还是对责任感兴趣。如果我们想说人是负有责任的，那么我们就不能干涉他们的自由，因为如果他们没有行动的自由，他们就不能承担起责任。而如果我们想说人是自由的，那么我们就必须通过维持惩罚性相倚联系来促使他们为其行为负责，因为如果他们在明显不具有惩罚性的相倚联系下仍以同样的方式行事，那他们显然就是不自由的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置924\n我们无法通过增强责任感来解决酗酒和青少年犯罪的问题。该为不良行为“负责”的是环境，必须要改变的也是环境，而不是个体的某种特性。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置944\n酗酒者常常第一个声称自己生了病，而犯下了罪行的青少年则往往会说自己是不良环境的牺牲品。如果他们不用为自己的所作所为承担责任，那他们就不能受到公正的惩罚。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置948\n**但现在人们普遍认为，没有愚笨的学生，只有不会教的教师；没有不好的孩子，只有不好的父母；青少年犯罪都是执法机构造成的；没有懒惰的人，只有不恰当的激励制度。当然，我们必须反问一句：为什么错的总是教师、父母、政府官员和企业家？正如我们在后面将会看到的，这种观点的错误在于：它总想把责任推给某个人，而且总认为其中存在着某种因果关系。**\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置1007\n一个人不会因为受过惩罚而不再以某种特定的方式行事，他至多能学会如何逃避惩罚而已。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023\n放任自流（permissiveness）\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023\n目前，有人已经严肃认真地提出用一种彻头彻尾的放任自流的做法来取代惩罚。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1038\n助产士式的控制（the controller as midwife），一个人帮助另一个人“生出”行为。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1061\n如果我们对一本书的内容已经滚瓜烂熟，或者如果我们对这本书的内容一窍不通，那我们是不会碰这本书的。我们愿意阅读的，通常是那些能帮助我们说出我们想说但又不能靠自己说出来的内容的书籍。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1071\n行为是可以“培养”的。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1073\n教师不能教，他只能帮助学生学。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1074\n弗洛伊德认为，一个人的成长必须经历好几个发展阶段，\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1080\n不过，只有施加控制，指导才会有效。指导意味着要开辟新的机会，或者阻止行为朝某个特定的方向发展。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1089\n如果创造出一种环境，让人们在其中快速学会有效的行为，并持续有效地表现出这一行为，那无疑将很有价值。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1097\n依赖于事物而不是依赖于他人的做法，其优点之一在于可以节省他人的时间和精力。一个人应当依赖的“事物”中，还包括那些没有专为改变他的行为而采取行动的人。依赖于事物还有一个重要的优点，那就是：与他人安排的相倚联系相比，与事物有关的相倚联系通常更为精确，且能塑造更为有用的行为。 事物的世界可能是一个专断、暴虐的世界。依赖于事物并不等于独立。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1125\n一个人永远都不可能真正自立。即使他能有效地处理各种事情，他也必定依赖于那些曾经教他这样做的人。是这些人为他选定了他该依赖的事物，并决定了他依赖的形式和程度。（因此，他们不能推卸对结果所应承担的责任。）\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1137\n任何人都不会对提示、暗示、建议做出任何反应，除非他已经拥有某种以某一特定方式行事的倾向。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1140\n树立榜样也是在施加某种类似的控制，它利用了人们会模仿他人言行的一般性倾向。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1150\n只有在个体已经有了某种行动的倾向时，敦促和劝说才会产生效果，而且，只要这种倾向无法解释，我们就可以把他的行为归因于一个内在人。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1172\n我们可以改变一种行为发生的可能性，但我们改变不了需要。我们常以特定的方式来强化行为，但我们给不了一个人目的或意图。我们可以改变对待某物的行为，但改变不了对它的态度。我们可以抽取并改变言语行为，但改变不了观点。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1174\n改变思想的另一种方式，是指明一个人以某种特定方式行为的原因，而这些原因几乎都可能相倚于行为的结果。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1199\n像放任自流、助产术、指导、依赖于事物等方法一样，自由与尊严的捍卫者也对改变思想的方法持容忍的态度，因为它是一种不太有效的改变行为的方法，而且，改变思想者也可以因此而逃避指责，不让别人说他是在控制人。事情出错时，他也可以不用承担责任。这样，自主人就幸存了下来，他会因为所取得的成就受到褒奖，也会因为犯下的错误而受到指责。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1211\n只有存在可利用的其他形式的控制时，控制最少的政府才是最好的政府。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1213\n**自由经济并不意味着不要经济控制，这是因为，只要货物与金钱依然具有强化作用，经济就无自由可言。**\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1295\n通过说某物好或坏来进行价值判断，其实是根据这个物体的强化效果对其作一归类。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1388\n正如我们已经看到的，公正或公平的问题常常不过是一个善于管理资源的问题。这个问题在于强化物是否得到了明智的运用。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1428\n任何规则或法律都包含一条有关普遍相倚联系（可能是自然的相倚联系，也可能是社会性的相倚联系）的陈述。\n\n第六章 价值  - 位置1431\n建筑工人戴上安全帽，从而遵守了一条规则。这里的自然相倚联系（涉及保护建筑工人不被下落物击中头部）并不十分有效，因而必须强制实施另一条规则：如果有建筑工人不戴安全帽，他就将被解雇。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1450\n教育领域也是如此：非正式群体的成员通常在有意或无意指导之下相互学习，而有组织的教育则会雇用被我们称为教师的专家，让他们在特定的地方（即我们所说的学校）通过安排与特定强化物（如成绩、文凭）相关的相倚联系来进行教育。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1484\n减少冲突，使用更为有力的强化物，增强相倚联系的作用，从而加强原初的控制。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1488\n如果学生不学习，那不是因为他们对学习不感兴趣，而是因为学习标准太低，或者是因为所学的课程与一种让人满意的生活早已没有任何关联。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1496\n第一步要做的是：确定一个人在为他人利益效力而受到控制时所能获得的利益有哪些。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1528\n人作为一种社会性动物拥有一种优势，那就是：不需要亲自去发现所有的实践活动。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1537\n人作为一种社会性动物还有另外一个优势：每一个个体归根结底都是“他人”中的一员，都会实施控制，而且，他们都是为了自己的利益而实施控制的。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1590\n人类学家经常强调，应该用这种能容忍不同观点的相对论来替代宗教狂热，因为宗教狂热力图将所有的文化都转化为一套单一的伦理、政府、宗教或经济方面的价值。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1629\n**文化是一套习俗体系，但不是一套不可与其他习俗体系相融合的体系。**\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1657\n物种和文化首先要面对的都是与自然环境的“竞争”。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1674\n而一个人对自己文化之生存的感受，则取决于该文化采用什么样的手段来诱使其成员为其生存而效力。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1695\n生存是我们最终评价一种文化的唯一价值，从定义上看，任何能促进生存的习俗都具有生存价值。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1721\n文化的演进是“进步”吗？它的目标是什么？它的目标是产生一种与那些诱使个体为其文化之生存而努力的结果。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1765\n我们说某些文化尚未充分发展或不成熟，那是相对于我们所说的其他“先进”文化而言的。但是，如果有人说有哪种政府、宗教或经济制度是成熟的制度，那么，这实际上是一种低级的沙文主义。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置1860\n通过改变行为发挥作用的条件，便可以改变行为。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置1933\n失败并不总是错误，它或许只是一个人在当时的情形之下所能做出的最好选择。其实真正的错误是停止尝试。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置2037\n这个世界之所以会被喜欢，是因为人们所接受的教育要求他们要喜欢它，而至于为什么要喜欢，则并非总有人去做细细的审查。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置2186\n生存价值会随着环境的改变而改变。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2277\n一个人的行为在某种程度上应归因于先前的事件，而且相比于人自身，环境更可能对人的行为产生影响。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2357\n**有人说，人之所以有别于其他动物，主要是因为他能“意识到他自己的存在”。**\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2456\n这个问题在神学中占有奇妙的地位。人是因为邪恶才犯罪，还是因为犯了罪才邪恶？事实上，这两种问法都不能说明任何有用的东西。说一个人是因为犯了罪才邪恶，其实是给犯罪下了一个操作性定义。而说一个人是因为邪恶才犯罪，也只不过是把他的行为归咎到了一种假想的内在特性上。但是，一个人是否会做出那种被称为犯罪的行为，通常取决于上述两种问法都没有提及的环境条件。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2475\n自我就是一整套与某一既定系列的相倚联系相适应的行为。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2568\n人自身可能会受到周围环境的控制，但周围的环境几乎全部都是由他自己创造的。大多数人的物质环境基本上都是人造的。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2595\n人所造就的人，其实是人所设计之文化的产物。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2615\n甚至在组织最为严密的文化中，每一个人的经历也都是独特的。任何有意设计的文化都不能消除这种独特性，而且正如我们已经看到的，任何旨在消除独特性的努力都是糟糕的设计。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2622\n**个人主义（individualism）面临的最大问题是死亡——它是个体无法逃避的命运，是对自由和尊严的致命打击。**\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2656\n再有一种影响就是怀旧感（nostalgia）。当人们抓住并夸大了现在与过去之间的相似之处时，旧有的技能便会涌现出来。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2661\n任何事物都不会因为我们审视它、谈论它或以一种新的方式分析它而有所改变。\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2690\n一种新理论可以改变的只不过是我们对其研究对象所做的事情。一种关于人的科学观点提供了各种让人兴奋的可能性。我们至今尚未看到人到底将人造就成了什么样子。\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2809\n当我们让某人喝一两杯酒从而让他高兴起来，或者当他自己喝了点酒或抽了点大麻从而“减少了他内在世界的厌恶性特征”时，他的感受似乎发生了改变。但是，真正发生改变的不是感受，而是所感觉到的身体状态。一种文化的设计者往往会改变伴随与环境相关之行为的感受，而且，他通常是通过改变环境做到这一点的。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2884\n由于传递模式的不同，“一代人”在生物进化和文化演进过程中的含义往往会有很大的差异。在文化演进过程中，它只不过是一个衡量时间的尺度。仅在一代人的身上，文化方面的变化（“变异”）就有可能出现，而且可能会被传递很多次。\n","source":"_posts/超越自由与尊严.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 《超越自由与尊严》摘录\ntags: 随笔\ncomments: false\ncategories: 随笔\ndate: 2020-04-20 17:23:41\n---\n第一章 行为技术 - 位置147\n此外，将行为视作一种功能的条件也被人们忽略了。对于好奇心，人们最终得出的往往是心理的解释。在日常交谈中，我们常常会看到这一点。如果我们问某人“你为什么要去看戏剧？”，他回答说“因为我想去”，我们很容易把他的回答当成一种解释。我们更应该了解的是他以前去看戏剧时曾发生过什么，他去看戏时曾听到或看到过什么，他过去或当前的环境中有哪些东西可能会促使他去看戏（而不是去做其他事情）。但实际上，我们往往会将“我想去”这三个字看成对上述这些问题的总结，而且很可能不会再去询问更多的细节。\n<!--more-->\n第一章行为技术 - 位置167\n内在人（innerman）的作用在于提供一种解释，但反过来，这种解释本身却不能获得解释。于是，解释便在他这里中止了。内在人不是过去经历和当前行为之间的中介，而是产生行为的中心。他的作用在于启动、开启、创造，这样一来，他便一直被覆盖着一层神秘的面纱，就像他在希腊人心目中的样子一样。因此，我们说，他是自主的——从行为科学的角度说，这意味着他是不可思议的。与之相似，还有外在人（outerman）的概念。\n\n第一章 行为技术 - 位置275\n科学是人类行为，与科学相对立的也是人类行为。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置317\n几乎所有生物的行为都是为了让自己摆脱有害的接触。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置325\n行为还有一个更为重要的作用，它能以另一种方式削弱有害的刺激。虽然它不是以条件反射的形式获得的，但却是一种不同的被称为操作性条件作用的过程的产物。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置341\n他们也可能是“有意”让人厌恶的——他们可能会为了某种结果而以让人厌恶的方式来对待他人。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置347\n厌恶性控制（aversivecontrol）\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置348\n如果有人以令人厌恶的方式对待一个人，直到这个人就范，那么，当这个人做出前者所要求的行为以逃开或避免这种令人厌恶的对待方式时，其结果就强化了前者的行为。不过，他也可以采用别的方式来逃避。另一种变相的逃避方式是攻击那些设置厌恶性条件的人，并削弱或摧毁他们的力量。\n\n第二章 自由- 位置362\n蓄意破坏和暴动骚乱常常是无明确指向对象或指向错误对象的攻击行为。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置391\n在约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒看来，“自由是指一个人能做他想做之事”。自由文献在改变实践的过程中发挥了重要的作用（无论是在什么时候，也无论它在其中发挥了怎样的作用，它都改变了实践），但它却把自己的任务确定为改变心理状态和情感状态。自由是一种“占有”（possession）。人逃避或摧毁控制者的权力是为了感受自由，而一旦他感受到了自由，能做自己想做之事后，自由文献除了提醒他要永远保持警惕以防控制者再次实施控制之外，或许再也推荐不了任何更进一步的行动，也指定不了什么东西了。\n\n第二章 自由  - 位置399\n工资则例证了另一种不同的原则：一个人若按某一特定的方式行事，他就会获得报酬，这样一来，他就会继续以那一特定的方式行事。尽管人们很早以前就已经认识到了奖赏所具有的有效作用，但工资制度的发展却非常缓慢。在19世纪，人们认为，工业社会需要一支饥饿的劳动力队伍。只有当饥饿的工人可以用工资来换取食物时，工资才能发挥实际的效用。如果减少工人对劳动的厌恶感——例如，缩短劳动时间，改善劳动条件——那么，即使报酬降低，也有可能让工人愿意劳动。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置412\n人们通常所说的条件性正强化物（conditioned positive reinforcer），使用后，往往会带来延迟的厌恶性结果。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置483\n还有一个例子是邀请囚犯自愿参加那些很可能有危险的实验——例如，新药物的实验。如果参加实验，囚犯便可以获得更好的生活条件或者减刑。如果囚犯是被迫参加实验的，那么，人人都将反对。但是，当囚犯受到正强化，尤其是当政府施行这种改善生活条件或缩短刑期的做法时，他们真的是自由的吗？\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置491\n自由文献中经常出现的两种观点清楚地表明了人们对于积极控制（positive control）的不确定态度。有人提出，虽然行为完全是被决定的，但一个人“感觉自由”或“认为他自己是自由的”总是要好一些。如果这意味着采取不会产生厌恶性结果的控制方式会更好一些，那我们或许会赞同；但如果这意味着采取不会招致任何人反抗的控制方式更好，那么，这种说法就没有考虑到存在延迟的厌恶性结果的可能性。第二种说法似乎更为恰当一些：“做一个意识清醒的奴隶（slave）比做一个快乐的奴隶好。”“奴隶”这个词澄清了我们正在思考的那些最终后果的实质：它们是剥削性的，因而是令人厌恶的。奴隶所能意识到的是他所经历的悲惨遭遇，而一种精心设计以致不会招来任何反抗的奴隶制度才是真正的威胁所在。自由文献意在让人们“意识到”这种厌恶性控制，但它所选择的方法却不能拯救快乐的奴隶。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置500\n尽管事实上一直是你 [教师]在控制孩子，但你也应该让 [孩子]相信，他一直是在他自己的掌控之中。没有任何形式的征服像保持表面上的自由那样完美，因为在这种征服中，你可以俘获意志本身。可怜的婴儿，一无所知，一无所能，一无所学，难道他不是任你摆布吗？难道你不能为他安排周围世界的一切吗？难道你不能随心所欲地影响他吗？他的学业和游戏、他的痛苦和快乐，难道不都在你的掌控之中而不为他所知吗？毫无疑问，他本应该只做他想做的事情；但他却只应该想做你想让他做的事情；他不应该迈出你没有预见到的步子；在你不知道他要说什么的时候，他就不应该开口。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置520\n如果不是因为有“一切控制都是错误的”这个毫无根据的概括，我们应该可以像处理非社会问题那样简单地解决社会环境的问题。虽然科技的发展已经让人们摆脱了环境所具有的一些厌恶性特征，但它并没有让人摆脱环境。我们承认我们依赖于周围世界这一事实，而我们要改变的仅仅只是这种依赖的性质。同样，要使社会环境尽可能地摆脱厌恶性刺激，我们并不需要去破坏环境或逃离环境，我们需要重新设计它。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置532\n任何表明一个人的行为可能由外界环境引起的证据，都似乎会对这个人的尊严或价值产生威胁。一个人的成就如果事实上是通过一些他无法控制的力量而取得的，那么，我们往往不会表扬他。我们可以在一定程度上容忍这样的证据，就像我们满不在乎地接受一些表明人并不自由的证据一样。当我们将艺术作品、文学作品、政治生涯、科学发现中的重要成就归因于艺术家、作家、政治家和科学家在各自的生活中所受到的“影响”时，没有谁会因此而感到非常困扰。但是，当行为分析提出的进一步证据表明，一个人之所以取得成就，几乎完全都是外界的原因，而没有他自身的原因时，这种证据及其所依据的科学便会遭到挑战。\n**自由是由于行为的厌恶性结果而引发的一个问题，而尊严（dignity）却与正强化有关。**\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置546\n我们往往会去强化那些强化我们的人，这可能是一种自然倾向，就像我们会攻击那些攻击我们的人一样。不过，相似的行为往往产生于许多不同的社会性相倚联系。我们之所以赞扬那些为我们的利益而工作的人，是因为他们继续那样做便会使我们得到强化。当我们因为某事赞扬某人，我们就确定出了一种额外的强化结果。我们表彰一个赢得比赛的人，是为了强调这样一个事实，即比赛的胜利有赖于他的行为，因此，胜利对他而言可能更具有强化作用。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置573\n我们之所以习惯于称赞那些过独身生活、将所属财产捐赠他人，或者在遭受迫害时仍忠于某项事业的人，是因为他们都有明确的理由可以做出不同的行为。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置576\n就像拉罗什富科所观察到的：“无论是谁，如果他的性格中没有为恶的力量，他的善就不值得称赞。除此之外，其他一切所谓的善都只不过是意志的懒散或软弱而已。”\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置578\n当行为明确受到刺激控制时，褒奖与行为原因的可见性之间的反比关系就表现得尤其明显。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置616\n我们通过让自己置身于通常只会引起无价值行为的条件，同时避免以无价值的方式行事，以此来夸大我们应得的褒奖。我们总是努力找出使行为获得正强化的那些条件，然后又拒绝做出那种行为；我们追求诱惑，就像在沙漠中行走的圣徒在附近安排美女和美食，借此将自己苦行生活的美德最大化。我们就像自行鞭笞者一样，在本可以住手时，却依然继续惩罚自己，或者，在本可以逃脱时，却依然屈从于殉道者的命运。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置656\n我们对于不理解的事物总是心生敬畏，因此，我们越不了解某个行为，就越可能羡慕它，这就不足为奇了。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置671\n我们所说的尊严之战与自由之战有许多共同的特征。移除一种正强化物是令人厌恶的，因此，当人们被剥夺奖赏、赞美或者受赞扬或赞美的机会时，他们也会产生相似的反应。他们会逃离那些剥夺他们的人，或者向其发起攻击，以削弱这些人的力量。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置711\n虽然从事危险、艰苦且令人痛苦的工作的人常常受人称赞，但几乎所有人都愿意放弃因做这些工作而获得的称赞。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置728\n我们因一个人的所作所为而给予他奖赏，意味着我们认识到了他的尊严或价值。而我们所给予的奖赏的量通常与他的行为原因的明显性成反比。如果我们不知道一个人为何会如此行事，那我们就会把他的行为归因于他自身。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置748\n惩罚一词通常仅限于由他人蓄意安排的相倚性，而他们之所以要安排这些相倚性，是因为由此产生的结果对他们而言具有强化作用。（我们注意不要将惩罚性相倚联系与厌恶性控制相混淆。厌恶性控制通常被用来引导人们以某些特定的方式行事，而惩罚性相倚联系则常被用来引导人们不以某些特定的方式行事。）\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置759\n惩罚被设计出来，是为了将那些难以处理的、危险的或者不适宜的行为从人的整个行为中清除出去。惩罚的设计基于这样一种假设，即一个人在受到惩罚之后，便不太可能再以同样的方式行事。但不幸的是，事情并非如此简单。奖励与惩罚的不同不仅仅表现在它们所引发之改变的方向上。一个曾因玩性游戏而遭受严厉惩罚的孩子，并不一定不会继续表现出这样的行为；一个曾因其暴行而锒铛入狱的人，也不一定在今后不再表现出暴力行为。被惩罚的行为在惩罚性相倚联系被撤销后，很可能会再次表现出来。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置768\n毫不夸张地说，受过惩罚的人在以后很可能会“为了逃避惩罚”而采取一些行为。他可能会为了避免受罚而采取不会受罚的行为方式，但也存在其他的可能性。其中有些逃避惩罚的方式是破坏性的、适应不良的或者神经症性的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置777\n或者将他人的行为解释为应该受罚，从而投射（projecting）他自己的倾向。他还可以合理化（rationalize）自己的行为，向自己或他人提供一大堆理由，从而使得本该受罚的行为成为不该受罚的行为——例如，他声称，他之所以打孩子，是为了孩子好。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置784\n一个经常因为易于动怒而受罚的人，在下一次动怒前可以先从一数到十。如果在数数的过程中，他做出攻击性行为的倾向降低到了可控的水平，那么，他就可以避免受到惩罚了。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置788\n惩罚性相倚联系还可以包括引导一个人去寻找或建构他在其中能够采取一些行为来取代受罚行为的环境。他会一天到晚忙着做一些不会受罚的事情，从而让自己远离麻烦，譬如坚持不懈地“做着其他一些事情”。（许多似乎不产生积极强化效果因而显得不合理的行为，可能具有取代受罚行为的作用。）个体甚至还可以采取措施来强化那些教导他不要做出受罚行为的相倚联系。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置795\n通过创造一些行为不易受罚的环境，人们便可以减少受罚行为。还有一种可以采取的策略是打破那些使得受罚行为得到强化的相倚联系。另一种策略是安排环境，使得行为在其中可以发生，但不会受到惩罚。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置854\n人们常常会告诉自己该做什么、不该做什么，但却往往忽略了这样一个事实，即他这样做，都是社会一直以来通过言语的方式教导他的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置874\n善就像尊严或价值的其他方面一样，会随着可见控制的减弱而增强。当然，自由同样也是如此。因此，善与自由往往密切相关。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置899\n一个人“打算怎么做”，通常取决于他过去做过的事情，以及在他做过这些事情之后所发生的事情。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置904\n**“只有自由的人才能为自己的行为负责”**，这一观点有两层含义，要看我们是对自由还是对责任感兴趣。如果我们想说人是负有责任的，那么我们就不能干涉他们的自由，因为如果他们没有行动的自由，他们就不能承担起责任。而如果我们想说人是自由的，那么我们就必须通过维持惩罚性相倚联系来促使他们为其行为负责，因为如果他们在明显不具有惩罚性的相倚联系下仍以同样的方式行事，那他们显然就是不自由的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置924\n我们无法通过增强责任感来解决酗酒和青少年犯罪的问题。该为不良行为“负责”的是环境，必须要改变的也是环境，而不是个体的某种特性。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置944\n酗酒者常常第一个声称自己生了病，而犯下了罪行的青少年则往往会说自己是不良环境的牺牲品。如果他们不用为自己的所作所为承担责任，那他们就不能受到公正的惩罚。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置948\n**但现在人们普遍认为，没有愚笨的学生，只有不会教的教师；没有不好的孩子，只有不好的父母；青少年犯罪都是执法机构造成的；没有懒惰的人，只有不恰当的激励制度。当然，我们必须反问一句：为什么错的总是教师、父母、政府官员和企业家？正如我们在后面将会看到的，这种观点的错误在于：它总想把责任推给某个人，而且总认为其中存在着某种因果关系。**\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置1007\n一个人不会因为受过惩罚而不再以某种特定的方式行事，他至多能学会如何逃避惩罚而已。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023\n放任自流（permissiveness）\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023\n目前，有人已经严肃认真地提出用一种彻头彻尾的放任自流的做法来取代惩罚。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1038\n助产士式的控制（the controller as midwife），一个人帮助另一个人“生出”行为。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1061\n如果我们对一本书的内容已经滚瓜烂熟，或者如果我们对这本书的内容一窍不通，那我们是不会碰这本书的。我们愿意阅读的，通常是那些能帮助我们说出我们想说但又不能靠自己说出来的内容的书籍。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1071\n行为是可以“培养”的。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1073\n教师不能教，他只能帮助学生学。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1074\n弗洛伊德认为，一个人的成长必须经历好几个发展阶段，\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1080\n不过，只有施加控制，指导才会有效。指导意味着要开辟新的机会，或者阻止行为朝某个特定的方向发展。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1089\n如果创造出一种环境，让人们在其中快速学会有效的行为，并持续有效地表现出这一行为，那无疑将很有价值。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1097\n依赖于事物而不是依赖于他人的做法，其优点之一在于可以节省他人的时间和精力。一个人应当依赖的“事物”中，还包括那些没有专为改变他的行为而采取行动的人。依赖于事物还有一个重要的优点，那就是：与他人安排的相倚联系相比，与事物有关的相倚联系通常更为精确，且能塑造更为有用的行为。 事物的世界可能是一个专断、暴虐的世界。依赖于事物并不等于独立。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1125\n一个人永远都不可能真正自立。即使他能有效地处理各种事情，他也必定依赖于那些曾经教他这样做的人。是这些人为他选定了他该依赖的事物，并决定了他依赖的形式和程度。（因此，他们不能推卸对结果所应承担的责任。）\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1137\n任何人都不会对提示、暗示、建议做出任何反应，除非他已经拥有某种以某一特定方式行事的倾向。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1140\n树立榜样也是在施加某种类似的控制，它利用了人们会模仿他人言行的一般性倾向。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1150\n只有在个体已经有了某种行动的倾向时，敦促和劝说才会产生效果，而且，只要这种倾向无法解释，我们就可以把他的行为归因于一个内在人。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1172\n我们可以改变一种行为发生的可能性，但我们改变不了需要。我们常以特定的方式来强化行为，但我们给不了一个人目的或意图。我们可以改变对待某物的行为，但改变不了对它的态度。我们可以抽取并改变言语行为，但改变不了观点。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1174\n改变思想的另一种方式，是指明一个人以某种特定方式行为的原因，而这些原因几乎都可能相倚于行为的结果。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1199\n像放任自流、助产术、指导、依赖于事物等方法一样，自由与尊严的捍卫者也对改变思想的方法持容忍的态度，因为它是一种不太有效的改变行为的方法，而且，改变思想者也可以因此而逃避指责，不让别人说他是在控制人。事情出错时，他也可以不用承担责任。这样，自主人就幸存了下来，他会因为所取得的成就受到褒奖，也会因为犯下的错误而受到指责。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1211\n只有存在可利用的其他形式的控制时，控制最少的政府才是最好的政府。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1213\n**自由经济并不意味着不要经济控制，这是因为，只要货物与金钱依然具有强化作用，经济就无自由可言。**\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1295\n通过说某物好或坏来进行价值判断，其实是根据这个物体的强化效果对其作一归类。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1388\n正如我们已经看到的，公正或公平的问题常常不过是一个善于管理资源的问题。这个问题在于强化物是否得到了明智的运用。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1428\n任何规则或法律都包含一条有关普遍相倚联系（可能是自然的相倚联系，也可能是社会性的相倚联系）的陈述。\n\n第六章 价值  - 位置1431\n建筑工人戴上安全帽，从而遵守了一条规则。这里的自然相倚联系（涉及保护建筑工人不被下落物击中头部）并不十分有效，因而必须强制实施另一条规则：如果有建筑工人不戴安全帽，他就将被解雇。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1450\n教育领域也是如此：非正式群体的成员通常在有意或无意指导之下相互学习，而有组织的教育则会雇用被我们称为教师的专家，让他们在特定的地方（即我们所说的学校）通过安排与特定强化物（如成绩、文凭）相关的相倚联系来进行教育。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1484\n减少冲突，使用更为有力的强化物，增强相倚联系的作用，从而加强原初的控制。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1488\n如果学生不学习，那不是因为他们对学习不感兴趣，而是因为学习标准太低，或者是因为所学的课程与一种让人满意的生活早已没有任何关联。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1496\n第一步要做的是：确定一个人在为他人利益效力而受到控制时所能获得的利益有哪些。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1528\n人作为一种社会性动物拥有一种优势，那就是：不需要亲自去发现所有的实践活动。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1537\n人作为一种社会性动物还有另外一个优势：每一个个体归根结底都是“他人”中的一员，都会实施控制，而且，他们都是为了自己的利益而实施控制的。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1590\n人类学家经常强调，应该用这种能容忍不同观点的相对论来替代宗教狂热，因为宗教狂热力图将所有的文化都转化为一套单一的伦理、政府、宗教或经济方面的价值。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1629\n**文化是一套习俗体系，但不是一套不可与其他习俗体系相融合的体系。**\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1657\n物种和文化首先要面对的都是与自然环境的“竞争”。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1674\n而一个人对自己文化之生存的感受，则取决于该文化采用什么样的手段来诱使其成员为其生存而效力。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1695\n生存是我们最终评价一种文化的唯一价值，从定义上看，任何能促进生存的习俗都具有生存价值。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1721\n文化的演进是“进步”吗？它的目标是什么？它的目标是产生一种与那些诱使个体为其文化之生存而努力的结果。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1765\n我们说某些文化尚未充分发展或不成熟，那是相对于我们所说的其他“先进”文化而言的。但是，如果有人说有哪种政府、宗教或经济制度是成熟的制度，那么，这实际上是一种低级的沙文主义。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置1860\n通过改变行为发挥作用的条件，便可以改变行为。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置1933\n失败并不总是错误，它或许只是一个人在当时的情形之下所能做出的最好选择。其实真正的错误是停止尝试。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置2037\n这个世界之所以会被喜欢，是因为人们所接受的教育要求他们要喜欢它，而至于为什么要喜欢，则并非总有人去做细细的审查。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置2186\n生存价值会随着环境的改变而改变。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2277\n一个人的行为在某种程度上应归因于先前的事件，而且相比于人自身，环境更可能对人的行为产生影响。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2357\n**有人说，人之所以有别于其他动物，主要是因为他能“意识到他自己的存在”。**\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2456\n这个问题在神学中占有奇妙的地位。人是因为邪恶才犯罪，还是因为犯了罪才邪恶？事实上，这两种问法都不能说明任何有用的东西。说一个人是因为犯了罪才邪恶，其实是给犯罪下了一个操作性定义。而说一个人是因为邪恶才犯罪，也只不过是把他的行为归咎到了一种假想的内在特性上。但是，一个人是否会做出那种被称为犯罪的行为，通常取决于上述两种问法都没有提及的环境条件。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2475\n自我就是一整套与某一既定系列的相倚联系相适应的行为。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2568\n人自身可能会受到周围环境的控制，但周围的环境几乎全部都是由他自己创造的。大多数人的物质环境基本上都是人造的。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2595\n人所造就的人，其实是人所设计之文化的产物。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2615\n甚至在组织最为严密的文化中，每一个人的经历也都是独特的。任何有意设计的文化都不能消除这种独特性，而且正如我们已经看到的，任何旨在消除独特性的努力都是糟糕的设计。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2622\n**个人主义（individualism）面临的最大问题是死亡——它是个体无法逃避的命运，是对自由和尊严的致命打击。**\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2656\n再有一种影响就是怀旧感（nostalgia）。当人们抓住并夸大了现在与过去之间的相似之处时，旧有的技能便会涌现出来。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2661\n任何事物都不会因为我们审视它、谈论它或以一种新的方式分析它而有所改变。\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2690\n一种新理论可以改变的只不过是我们对其研究对象所做的事情。一种关于人的科学观点提供了各种让人兴奋的可能性。我们至今尚未看到人到底将人造就成了什么样子。\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2809\n当我们让某人喝一两杯酒从而让他高兴起来，或者当他自己喝了点酒或抽了点大麻从而“减少了他内在世界的厌恶性特征”时，他的感受似乎发生了改变。但是，真正发生改变的不是感受，而是所感觉到的身体状态。一种文化的设计者往往会改变伴随与环境相关之行为的感受，而且，他通常是通过改变环境做到这一点的。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2884\n由于传递模式的不同，“一代人”在生物进化和文化演进过程中的含义往往会有很大的差异。在文化演进过程中，它只不过是一个衡量时间的尺度。仅在一代人的身上，文化方面的变化（“变异”）就有可能出现，而且可能会被传递很多次。\n","slug":"超越自由与尊严","published":1,"updated":"2020-04-20T09:24:13.883Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"ck9met65p001qsltpkx9qcoxm","content":"<p>第一章 行为技术 - 位置147<br>此外，将行为视作一种功能的条件也被人们忽略了。对于好奇心，人们最终得出的往往是心理的解释。在日常交谈中，我们常常会看到这一点。如果我们问某人“你为什么要去看戏剧？”，他回答说“因为我想去”，我们很容易把他的回答当成一种解释。我们更应该了解的是他以前去看戏剧时曾发生过什么，他去看戏时曾听到或看到过什么，他过去或当前的环境中有哪些东西可能会促使他去看戏（而不是去做其他事情）。但实际上，我们往往会将“我想去”这三个字看成对上述这些问题的总结，而且很可能不会再去询问更多的细节。<br><a id=\"more\"></a><br>第一章行为技术 - 位置167<br>内在人（innerman）的作用在于提供一种解释，但反过来，这种解释本身却不能获得解释。于是，解释便在他这里中止了。内在人不是过去经历和当前行为之间的中介，而是产生行为的中心。他的作用在于启动、开启、创造，这样一来，他便一直被覆盖着一层神秘的面纱，就像他在希腊人心目中的样子一样。因此，我们说，他是自主的——从行为科学的角度说，这意味着他是不可思议的。与之相似，还有外在人（outerman）的概念。</p>\n<p>第一章 行为技术 - 位置275<br>科学是人类行为，与科学相对立的也是人类行为。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置317<br>几乎所有生物的行为都是为了让自己摆脱有害的接触。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置325<br>行为还有一个更为重要的作用，它能以另一种方式削弱有害的刺激。虽然它不是以条件反射的形式获得的，但却是一种不同的被称为操作性条件作用的过程的产物。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置341<br>他们也可能是“有意”让人厌恶的——他们可能会为了某种结果而以让人厌恶的方式来对待他人。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置347<br>厌恶性控制（aversivecontrol）</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置348<br>如果有人以令人厌恶的方式对待一个人，直到这个人就范，那么，当这个人做出前者所要求的行为以逃开或避免这种令人厌恶的对待方式时，其结果就强化了前者的行为。不过，他也可以采用别的方式来逃避。另一种变相的逃避方式是攻击那些设置厌恶性条件的人，并削弱或摧毁他们的力量。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由- 位置362<br>蓄意破坏和暴动骚乱常常是无明确指向对象或指向错误对象的攻击行为。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置391<br>在约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒看来，“自由是指一个人能做他想做之事”。自由文献在改变实践的过程中发挥了重要的作用（无论是在什么时候，也无论它在其中发挥了怎样的作用，它都改变了实践），但它却把自己的任务确定为改变心理状态和情感状态。自由是一种“占有”（possession）。人逃避或摧毁控制者的权力是为了感受自由，而一旦他感受到了自由，能做自己想做之事后，自由文献除了提醒他要永远保持警惕以防控制者再次实施控制之外，或许再也推荐不了任何更进一步的行动，也指定不了什么东西了。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由  - 位置399<br>工资则例证了另一种不同的原则：一个人若按某一特定的方式行事，他就会获得报酬，这样一来，他就会继续以那一特定的方式行事。尽管人们很早以前就已经认识到了奖赏所具有的有效作用，但工资制度的发展却非常缓慢。在19世纪，人们认为，工业社会需要一支饥饿的劳动力队伍。只有当饥饿的工人可以用工资来换取食物时，工资才能发挥实际的效用。如果减少工人对劳动的厌恶感——例如，缩短劳动时间，改善劳动条件——那么，即使报酬降低，也有可能让工人愿意劳动。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置412<br>人们通常所说的条件性正强化物（conditioned positive reinforcer），使用后，往往会带来延迟的厌恶性结果。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置483<br>还有一个例子是邀请囚犯自愿参加那些很可能有危险的实验——例如，新药物的实验。如果参加实验，囚犯便可以获得更好的生活条件或者减刑。如果囚犯是被迫参加实验的，那么，人人都将反对。但是，当囚犯受到正强化，尤其是当政府施行这种改善生活条件或缩短刑期的做法时，他们真的是自由的吗？</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置491<br>自由文献中经常出现的两种观点清楚地表明了人们对于积极控制（positive control）的不确定态度。有人提出，虽然行为完全是被决定的，但一个人“感觉自由”或“认为他自己是自由的”总是要好一些。如果这意味着采取不会产生厌恶性结果的控制方式会更好一些，那我们或许会赞同；但如果这意味着采取不会招致任何人反抗的控制方式更好，那么，这种说法就没有考虑到存在延迟的厌恶性结果的可能性。第二种说法似乎更为恰当一些：“做一个意识清醒的奴隶（slave）比做一个快乐的奴隶好。”“奴隶”这个词澄清了我们正在思考的那些最终后果的实质：它们是剥削性的，因而是令人厌恶的。奴隶所能意识到的是他所经历的悲惨遭遇，而一种精心设计以致不会招来任何反抗的奴隶制度才是真正的威胁所在。自由文献意在让人们“意识到”这种厌恶性控制，但它所选择的方法却不能拯救快乐的奴隶。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置500<br>尽管事实上一直是你 [教师]在控制孩子，但你也应该让 [孩子]相信，他一直是在他自己的掌控之中。没有任何形式的征服像保持表面上的自由那样完美，因为在这种征服中，你可以俘获意志本身。可怜的婴儿，一无所知，一无所能，一无所学，难道他不是任你摆布吗？难道你不能为他安排周围世界的一切吗？难道你不能随心所欲地影响他吗？他的学业和游戏、他的痛苦和快乐，难道不都在你的掌控之中而不为他所知吗？毫无疑问，他本应该只做他想做的事情；但他却只应该想做你想让他做的事情；他不应该迈出你没有预见到的步子；在你不知道他要说什么的时候，他就不应该开口。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置520<br>如果不是因为有“一切控制都是错误的”这个毫无根据的概括，我们应该可以像处理非社会问题那样简单地解决社会环境的问题。虽然科技的发展已经让人们摆脱了环境所具有的一些厌恶性特征，但它并没有让人摆脱环境。我们承认我们依赖于周围世界这一事实，而我们要改变的仅仅只是这种依赖的性质。同样，要使社会环境尽可能地摆脱厌恶性刺激，我们并不需要去破坏环境或逃离环境，我们需要重新设计它。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置532<br>任何表明一个人的行为可能由外界环境引起的证据，都似乎会对这个人的尊严或价值产生威胁。一个人的成就如果事实上是通过一些他无法控制的力量而取得的，那么，我们往往不会表扬他。我们可以在一定程度上容忍这样的证据，就像我们满不在乎地接受一些表明人并不自由的证据一样。当我们将艺术作品、文学作品、政治生涯、科学发现中的重要成就归因于艺术家、作家、政治家和科学家在各自的生活中所受到的“影响”时，没有谁会因此而感到非常困扰。但是，当行为分析提出的进一步证据表明，一个人之所以取得成就，几乎完全都是外界的原因，而没有他自身的原因时，这种证据及其所依据的科学便会遭到挑战。<br><strong>自由是由于行为的厌恶性结果而引发的一个问题，而尊严（dignity）却与正强化有关。</strong></p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置546<br>我们往往会去强化那些强化我们的人，这可能是一种自然倾向，就像我们会攻击那些攻击我们的人一样。不过，相似的行为往往产生于许多不同的社会性相倚联系。我们之所以赞扬那些为我们的利益而工作的人，是因为他们继续那样做便会使我们得到强化。当我们因为某事赞扬某人，我们就确定出了一种额外的强化结果。我们表彰一个赢得比赛的人，是为了强调这样一个事实，即比赛的胜利有赖于他的行为，因此，胜利对他而言可能更具有强化作用。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置573<br>我们之所以习惯于称赞那些过独身生活、将所属财产捐赠他人，或者在遭受迫害时仍忠于某项事业的人，是因为他们都有明确的理由可以做出不同的行为。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置576<br>就像拉罗什富科所观察到的：“无论是谁，如果他的性格中没有为恶的力量，他的善就不值得称赞。除此之外，其他一切所谓的善都只不过是意志的懒散或软弱而已。”</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置578<br>当行为明确受到刺激控制时，褒奖与行为原因的可见性之间的反比关系就表现得尤其明显。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置616<br>我们通过让自己置身于通常只会引起无价值行为的条件，同时避免以无价值的方式行事，以此来夸大我们应得的褒奖。我们总是努力找出使行为获得正强化的那些条件，然后又拒绝做出那种行为；我们追求诱惑，就像在沙漠中行走的圣徒在附近安排美女和美食，借此将自己苦行生活的美德最大化。我们就像自行鞭笞者一样，在本可以住手时，却依然继续惩罚自己，或者，在本可以逃脱时，却依然屈从于殉道者的命运。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置656<br>我们对于不理解的事物总是心生敬畏，因此，我们越不了解某个行为，就越可能羡慕它，这就不足为奇了。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置671<br>我们所说的尊严之战与自由之战有许多共同的特征。移除一种正强化物是令人厌恶的，因此，当人们被剥夺奖赏、赞美或者受赞扬或赞美的机会时，他们也会产生相似的反应。他们会逃离那些剥夺他们的人，或者向其发起攻击，以削弱这些人的力量。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置711<br>虽然从事危险、艰苦且令人痛苦的工作的人常常受人称赞，但几乎所有人都愿意放弃因做这些工作而获得的称赞。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置728<br>我们因一个人的所作所为而给予他奖赏，意味着我们认识到了他的尊严或价值。而我们所给予的奖赏的量通常与他的行为原因的明显性成反比。如果我们不知道一个人为何会如此行事，那我们就会把他的行为归因于他自身。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置748<br>惩罚一词通常仅限于由他人蓄意安排的相倚性，而他们之所以要安排这些相倚性，是因为由此产生的结果对他们而言具有强化作用。（我们注意不要将惩罚性相倚联系与厌恶性控制相混淆。厌恶性控制通常被用来引导人们以某些特定的方式行事，而惩罚性相倚联系则常被用来引导人们不以某些特定的方式行事。）</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置759<br>惩罚被设计出来，是为了将那些难以处理的、危险的或者不适宜的行为从人的整个行为中清除出去。惩罚的设计基于这样一种假设，即一个人在受到惩罚之后，便不太可能再以同样的方式行事。但不幸的是，事情并非如此简单。奖励与惩罚的不同不仅仅表现在它们所引发之改变的方向上。一个曾因玩性游戏而遭受严厉惩罚的孩子，并不一定不会继续表现出这样的行为；一个曾因其暴行而锒铛入狱的人，也不一定在今后不再表现出暴力行为。被惩罚的行为在惩罚性相倚联系被撤销后，很可能会再次表现出来。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置768<br>毫不夸张地说，受过惩罚的人在以后很可能会“为了逃避惩罚”而采取一些行为。他可能会为了避免受罚而采取不会受罚的行为方式，但也存在其他的可能性。其中有些逃避惩罚的方式是破坏性的、适应不良的或者神经症性的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置777<br>或者将他人的行为解释为应该受罚，从而投射（projecting）他自己的倾向。他还可以合理化（rationalize）自己的行为，向自己或他人提供一大堆理由，从而使得本该受罚的行为成为不该受罚的行为——例如，他声称，他之所以打孩子，是为了孩子好。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置784<br>一个经常因为易于动怒而受罚的人，在下一次动怒前可以先从一数到十。如果在数数的过程中，他做出攻击性行为的倾向降低到了可控的水平，那么，他就可以避免受到惩罚了。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置788<br>惩罚性相倚联系还可以包括引导一个人去寻找或建构他在其中能够采取一些行为来取代受罚行为的环境。他会一天到晚忙着做一些不会受罚的事情，从而让自己远离麻烦，譬如坚持不懈地“做着其他一些事情”。（许多似乎不产生积极强化效果因而显得不合理的行为，可能具有取代受罚行为的作用。）个体甚至还可以采取措施来强化那些教导他不要做出受罚行为的相倚联系。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置795<br>通过创造一些行为不易受罚的环境，人们便可以减少受罚行为。还有一种可以采取的策略是打破那些使得受罚行为得到强化的相倚联系。另一种策略是安排环境，使得行为在其中可以发生，但不会受到惩罚。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置854<br>人们常常会告诉自己该做什么、不该做什么，但却往往忽略了这样一个事实，即他这样做，都是社会一直以来通过言语的方式教导他的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置874<br>善就像尊严或价值的其他方面一样，会随着可见控制的减弱而增强。当然，自由同样也是如此。因此，善与自由往往密切相关。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置899<br>一个人“打算怎么做”，通常取决于他过去做过的事情，以及在他做过这些事情之后所发生的事情。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置904<br><strong>“只有自由的人才能为自己的行为负责”</strong>，这一观点有两层含义，要看我们是对自由还是对责任感兴趣。如果我们想说人是负有责任的，那么我们就不能干涉他们的自由，因为如果他们没有行动的自由，他们就不能承担起责任。而如果我们想说人是自由的，那么我们就必须通过维持惩罚性相倚联系来促使他们为其行为负责，因为如果他们在明显不具有惩罚性的相倚联系下仍以同样的方式行事，那他们显然就是不自由的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置924<br>我们无法通过增强责任感来解决酗酒和青少年犯罪的问题。该为不良行为“负责”的是环境，必须要改变的也是环境，而不是个体的某种特性。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置944<br>酗酒者常常第一个声称自己生了病，而犯下了罪行的青少年则往往会说自己是不良环境的牺牲品。如果他们不用为自己的所作所为承担责任，那他们就不能受到公正的惩罚。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置948<br><strong>但现在人们普遍认为，没有愚笨的学生，只有不会教的教师；没有不好的孩子，只有不好的父母；青少年犯罪都是执法机构造成的；没有懒惰的人，只有不恰当的激励制度。当然，我们必须反问一句：为什么错的总是教师、父母、政府官员和企业家？正如我们在后面将会看到的，这种观点的错误在于：它总想把责任推给某个人，而且总认为其中存在着某种因果关系。</strong></p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置1007<br>一个人不会因为受过惩罚而不再以某种特定的方式行事，他至多能学会如何逃避惩罚而已。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023<br>放任自流（permissiveness）</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023<br>目前，有人已经严肃认真地提出用一种彻头彻尾的放任自流的做法来取代惩罚。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1038<br>助产士式的控制（the controller as midwife），一个人帮助另一个人“生出”行为。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1061<br>如果我们对一本书的内容已经滚瓜烂熟，或者如果我们对这本书的内容一窍不通，那我们是不会碰这本书的。我们愿意阅读的，通常是那些能帮助我们说出我们想说但又不能靠自己说出来的内容的书籍。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1071<br>行为是可以“培养”的。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1073<br>教师不能教，他只能帮助学生学。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1074<br>弗洛伊德认为，一个人的成长必须经历好几个发展阶段，</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1080<br>不过，只有施加控制，指导才会有效。指导意味着要开辟新的机会，或者阻止行为朝某个特定的方向发展。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1089<br>如果创造出一种环境，让人们在其中快速学会有效的行为，并持续有效地表现出这一行为，那无疑将很有价值。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1097<br>依赖于事物而不是依赖于他人的做法，其优点之一在于可以节省他人的时间和精力。一个人应当依赖的“事物”中，还包括那些没有专为改变他的行为而采取行动的人。依赖于事物还有一个重要的优点，那就是：与他人安排的相倚联系相比，与事物有关的相倚联系通常更为精确，且能塑造更为有用的行为。 事物的世界可能是一个专断、暴虐的世界。依赖于事物并不等于独立。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1125<br>一个人永远都不可能真正自立。即使他能有效地处理各种事情，他也必定依赖于那些曾经教他这样做的人。是这些人为他选定了他该依赖的事物，并决定了他依赖的形式和程度。（因此，他们不能推卸对结果所应承担的责任。）</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1137<br>任何人都不会对提示、暗示、建议做出任何反应，除非他已经拥有某种以某一特定方式行事的倾向。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1140<br>树立榜样也是在施加某种类似的控制，它利用了人们会模仿他人言行的一般性倾向。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1150<br>只有在个体已经有了某种行动的倾向时，敦促和劝说才会产生效果，而且，只要这种倾向无法解释，我们就可以把他的行为归因于一个内在人。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1172<br>我们可以改变一种行为发生的可能性，但我们改变不了需要。我们常以特定的方式来强化行为，但我们给不了一个人目的或意图。我们可以改变对待某物的行为，但改变不了对它的态度。我们可以抽取并改变言语行为，但改变不了观点。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1174<br>改变思想的另一种方式，是指明一个人以某种特定方式行为的原因，而这些原因几乎都可能相倚于行为的结果。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1199<br>像放任自流、助产术、指导、依赖于事物等方法一样，自由与尊严的捍卫者也对改变思想的方法持容忍的态度，因为它是一种不太有效的改变行为的方法，而且，改变思想者也可以因此而逃避指责，不让别人说他是在控制人。事情出错时，他也可以不用承担责任。这样，自主人就幸存了下来，他会因为所取得的成就受到褒奖，也会因为犯下的错误而受到指责。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1211<br>只有存在可利用的其他形式的控制时，控制最少的政府才是最好的政府。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1213<br><strong>自由经济并不意味着不要经济控制，这是因为，只要货物与金钱依然具有强化作用，经济就无自由可言。</strong></p>\n<p>第六章 价值 -

位置1450<br>教育领域也是如此：非正式群体的成员通常在有意或无意指导之下相互学习，而有组织的教育则会雇用被我们称为教师的专家，让他们在特定的地方（即我们所说的学校）通过安排与特定强化物（如成绩、文凭）相关的相倚联系来进行教育。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1484<br>减少冲突，使用更为有力的强化物，增强相倚联系的作用，从而加强原初的控制。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 -

位置2186<br>生存价值会随着环境的改变而改变。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2277<br>一个人的行为在某种程度上应归因于先前的事件，而且相比于人自身，环境更可能对人的行为产生影响。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2357<br><strong>有人说，人之所以有别于其他动物，主要是因为他能“意识到他自己的存在”。</strong></p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2456<br>这个问题在神学中占有奇妙的地位。人是因为邪恶才犯罪，还是因为犯了罪才邪恶？事实上，这两种问法都不能说明任何有用的东西。说一个人是因为犯了罪才邪恶，其实是给犯罪下了一个操作性定义。而说一个人是因为邪恶才犯罪，也只不过是把他的行为归咎到了一种假想的内在特性上。但是，一个人是否会做出那种被称为犯罪的行为，通常取决于上述两种问法都没有提及的环境条件。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2475<br>自我就是一整套与某一既定系列的相倚联系相适应的行为。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2568<br>人自身可能会受到周围环境的控制，但周围的环境几乎全部都是由他自己创造的。大多数人的物质环境基本上都是人造的。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2595<br>人所造就的人，其实是人所设计之文化的产物。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2615<br>甚至在组织最为严密的文化中，每一个人的经历也都是独特的。任何有意设计的文化都不能消除这种独特性，而且正如我们已经看到的，任何旨在消除独特性的努力都是糟糕的设计。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2622<br><strong>个人主义（individualism）面临的最大问题是死亡——它是个体无法逃避的命运，是对自由和尊严的致命打击。</strong></p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么- 位置2656<br>再有一种影响就是怀旧感（nostalgia）。当人们抓住并夸大了现在与过去之间的相似之处时，旧有的技能便会涌现出来。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2661<br>任何事物都不会因为我们审视它、谈论它或以一种新的方式分析它而有所改变。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么- 位置2690<br>一种新理论可以改变的只不过是我们对其研究对象所做的事情。一种关于人的科学观点提供了各种让人兴奋的可能性。我们至今尚未看到人到底将人造就成了什么样子。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么- 位置2809<br>当我们让某人喝一两杯酒从而让他高兴起来，或者当他自己喝了点酒或抽了点大麻从而“减少了他内在世界的厌恶性特征”时，他的感受似乎发生了改变。但是，真正发生改变的不是感受，而是所感觉到的身体状态。一种文化的设计者往往会改变伴随与环境相关之行为的感受，而且，他通常是通过改变环境做到这一点的。</p>\n<p>第九章 人是什么 - 位置2884<br>由于传递模式的不同，“一代人”在生物进化和文化演进过程中的含义往往会有很大的差异。在文化演进过程中，它只不过是一个衡量时间的尺度。仅在一代人的身上，文化方面的变化（“变异”）就有可能出现，而且可能会被传递很多次。</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"<p>第一章 行为技术 - 位置147<br>此外，将行为视作一种功能的条件也被人们忽略了。对于好奇心，人们最终得出的往往是心理的解释。在日常交谈中，我们常常会看到这一点。如果我们问某人“你为什么要去看戏剧？”，他回答说“因为我想去”，我们很容易把他的回答当成一种解释。我们更应该了解的是他以前去看戏剧时曾发生过什么，他去看戏时曾听到或看到过什么，他过去或当前的环境中有哪些东西可能会促使他去看戏（而不是去做其他事情）。但实际上，我们往往会将“我想去”这三个字看成对上述这些问题的总结，而且很可能不会再去询问更多的细节。<br>","more":"<br>第一章行为技术 - 位置167<br>内在人（innerman）的作用在于提供一种解释，但反过来，这种解释本身却不能获得解释。于是，解释便在他这里中止了。内在人不是过去经历和当前行为之间的中介，而是产生行为的中心。他的作用在于启动、开启、创造，这样一来，他便一直被覆盖着一层神秘的面纱，就像他在希腊人心目中的样子一样。因此，我们说，他是自主的——从行为科学的角度说，这意味着他是不可思议的。与之相似，还有外在人（outerman）的概念。</p>\n<p>第一章 行为技术 - 位置275<br>科学是人类行为，与科学相对立的也是人类行为。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置317<br>几乎所有生物的行为都是为了让自己摆脱有害的接触。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置325<br>行为还有一个更为重要的作用，它能以另一种方式削弱有害的刺激。虽然它不是以条件反射的形式获得的，但却是一种不同的被称为操作性条件作用的过程的产物。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置341<br>他们也可能是“有意”让人厌恶的——他们可能会为了某种结果而以让人厌恶的方式来对待他人。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置347<br>厌恶性控制（aversivecontrol）</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置348<br>如果有人以令人厌恶的方式对待一个人，直到这个人就范，那么，当这个人做出前者所要求的行为以逃开或避免这种令人厌恶的对待方式时，其结果就强化了前者的行为。不过，他也可以采用别的方式来逃避。另一种变相的逃避方式是攻击那些设置厌恶性条件的人，并削弱或摧毁他们的力量。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由- 位置362<br>蓄意破坏和暴动骚乱常常是无明确指向对象或指向错误对象的攻击行为。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置391<br>在约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒看来，“自由是指一个人能做他想做之事”。自由文献在改变实践的过程中发挥了重要的作用（无论是在什么时候，也无论它在其中发挥了怎样的作用，它都改变了实践），但它却把自己的任务确定为改变心理状态和情感状态。自由是一种“占有”（possession）。人逃避或摧毁控制者的权力是为了感受自由，而一旦他感受到了自由，能做自己想做之事后，自由文献除了提醒他要永远保持警惕以防控制者再次实施控制之外，或许再也推荐不了任何更进一步的行动，也指定不了什么东西了。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由  - 位置399<br>工资则例证了另一种不同的原则：一个人若按某一特定的方式行事，他就会获得报酬，这样一来，他就会继续以那一特定的方式行事。尽管人们很早以前就已经认识到了奖赏所具有的有效作用，但工资制度的发展却非常缓慢。在19世纪，人们认为，工业社会需要一支饥饿的劳动力队伍。只有当饥饿的工人可以用工资来换取食物时，工资才能发挥实际的效用。如果减少工人对劳动的厌恶感——例如，缩短劳动时间，改善劳动条件——那么，即使报酬降低，也有可能让工人愿意劳动。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置412<br>人们通常所说的条件性正强化物（conditioned positive reinforcer），使用后，往往会带来延迟的厌恶性结果。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置483<br>还有一个例子是邀请囚犯自愿参加那些很可能有危险的实验——例如，新药物的实验。如果参加实验，囚犯便可以获得更好的生活条件或者减刑。如果囚犯是被迫参加实验的，那么，人人都将反对。但是，当囚犯受到正强化，尤其是当政府施行这种改善生活条件或缩短刑期的做法时，他们真的是自由的吗？</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置491<br>自由文献中经常出现的两种观点清楚地表明了人们对于积极控制（positive control）的不确定态度。有人提出，虽然行为完全是被决定的，但一个人“感觉自由”或“认为他自己是自由的”总是要好一些。如果这意味着采取不会产生厌恶性结果的控制方式会更好一些，那我们或许会赞同；但如果这意味着采取不会招致任何人反抗的控制方式更好，那么，这种说法就没有考虑到存在延迟的厌恶性结果的可能性。第二种说法似乎更为恰当一些：“做一个意识清醒的奴隶（slave）比做一个快乐的奴隶好。”“奴隶”这个词澄清了我们正在思考的那些最终后果的实质：它们是剥削性的，因而是令人厌恶的。奴隶所能意识到的是他所经历的悲惨遭遇，而一种精心设计以致不会招来任何反抗的奴隶制度才是真正的威胁所在。自由文献意在让人们“意识到”这种厌恶性控制，但它所选择的方法却不能拯救快乐的奴隶。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置500<br>尽管事实上一直是你 [教师]在控制孩子，但你也应该让 [孩子]相信，他一直是在他自己的掌控之中。没有任何形式的征服像保持表面上的自由那样完美，因为在这种征服中，你可以俘获意志本身。可怜的婴儿，一无所知，一无所能，一无所学，难道他不是任你摆布吗？难道你不能为他安排周围世界的一切吗？难道你不能随心所欲地影响他吗？他的学业和游戏、他的痛苦和快乐，难道不都在你的掌控之中而不为他所知吗？毫无疑问，他本应该只做他想做的事情；但他却只应该想做你想让他做的事情；他不应该迈出你没有预见到的步子；在你不知道他要说什么的时候，他就不应该开口。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置520<br>如果不是因为有“一切控制都是错误的”这个毫无根据的概括，我们应该可以像处理非社会问题那样简单地解决社会环境的问题。虽然科技的发展已经让人们摆脱了环境所具有的一些厌恶性特征，但它并没有让人摆脱环境。我们承认我们依赖于周围世界这一事实，而我们要改变的仅仅只是这种依赖的性质。同样，要使社会环境尽可能地摆脱厌恶性刺激，我们并不需要去破坏环境或逃离环境，我们需要重新设计它。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置532<br>任何表明一个人的行为可能由外界环境引起的证据，都似乎会对这个人的尊严或价值产生威胁。一个人的成就如果事实上是通过一些他无法控制的力量而取得的，那么，我们往往不会表扬他。我们可以在一定程度上容忍这样的证据，就像我们满不在乎地接受一些表明人并不自由的证据一样。当我们将艺术作品、文学作品、政治生涯、科学发现中的重要成就归因于艺术家、作家、政治家和科学家在各自的生活中所受到的“影响”时，没有谁会因此而感到非常困扰。但是，当行为分析提出的进一步证据表明，一个人之所以取得成就，几乎完全都是外界的原因，而没有他自身的原因时，这种证据及其所依据的科学便会遭到挑战。<br><strong>自由是由于行为的厌恶性结果而引发的一个问题，而尊严（dignity）却与正强化有关。</strong></p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置546<br>我们往往会去强化那些强化我们的人，这可能是一种自然倾向，就像我们会攻击那些攻击我们的人一样。不过，相似的行为往往产生于许多不同的社会性相倚联系。我们之所以赞扬那些为我们的利益而工作的人，是因为他们继续那样做便会使我们得到强化。当我们因为某事赞扬某人，我们就确定出了一种额外的强化结果。我们表彰一个赢得比赛的人，是为了强调这样一个事实，即比赛的胜利有赖于他的行为，因此，胜利对他而言可能更具有强化作用。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置573<br>我们之所以习惯于称赞那些过独身生活、将所属财产捐赠他人，或者在遭受迫害时仍忠于某项事业的人，是因为他们都有明确的理由可以做出不同的行为。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置576<br>就像拉罗什富科所观察到的：“无论是谁，如果他的性格中没有为恶的力量，他的善就不值得称赞。除此之外，其他一切所谓的善都只不过是意志的懒散或软弱而已。”</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置578<br>当行为明确受到刺激控制时，褒奖与行为原因的可见性之间的反比关系就表现得尤其明显。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置616<br>我们通过让自己置身于通常只会引起无价值行为的条件，同时避免以无价值的方式行事，以此来夸大我们应得的褒奖。我们总是努力找出使行为获得正强化的那些条件，然后又拒绝做出那种行为；我们追求诱惑，就像在沙漠中行走的圣徒在附近安排美女和美食，借此将自己苦行生活的美德最大化。我们就像自行鞭笞者一样，在本可以住手时，却依然继续惩罚自己，或者，在本可以逃脱时，却依然屈从于殉道者的命运。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置656<br>我们对于不理解的事物总是心生敬畏，因此，我们越不了解某个行为，就越可能羡慕它，这就不足为奇了。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置671<br>我们所说的尊严之战与自由之战有许多共同的特征。移除一种正强化物是令人厌恶的，因此，当人们被剥夺奖赏、赞美或者受赞扬或赞美的机会时，他们也会产生相似的反应。他们会逃离那些剥夺他们的人，或者向其发起攻击，以削弱这些人的力量。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置711<br>虽然从事危险、艰苦且令人痛苦的工作的人常常受人称赞，但几乎所有人都愿意放弃因做这些工作而获得的称赞。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置728<br>我们因一个人的所作所为而给予他奖赏，意味着我们认识到了他的尊严或价值。而我们所给予的奖赏的量通常与他的行为原因的明显性成反比。如果我们不知道一个人为何会如此行事，那我们就会把他的行为归因于他自身。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置748<br>惩罚一词通常仅限于由他人蓄意安排的相倚性，而他们之所以要安排这些相倚性，是因为由此产生的结果对他们而言具有强化作用。（我们注意不要将惩罚性相倚联系与厌恶性控制相混淆。厌恶性控制通常被用来引导人们以某些特定的方式行事，而惩罚性相倚联系则常被用来引导人们不以某些特定的方式行事。）</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置759<br>惩罚被设计出来，是为了将那些难以处理的、危险的或者不适宜的行为从人的整个行为中清除出去。惩罚的设计基于这样一种假设，即一个人在受到惩罚之后，便不太可能再以同样的方式行事。但不幸的是，事情并非如此简单。奖励与惩罚的不同不仅仅表现在它们所引发之改变的方向上。一个曾因玩性游戏而遭受严厉惩罚的孩子，并不一定不会继续表现出这样的行为；一个曾因其暴行而锒铛入狱的人，也不一定在今后不再表现出暴力行为。被惩罚的行为在惩罚性相倚联系被撤销后，很可能会再次表现出来。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置768<br>毫不夸张地说，受过惩罚的人在以后很可能会“为了逃避惩罚”而采取一些行为。他可能会为了避免受罚而采取不会受罚的行为方式，但也存在其他的可能性。其中有些逃避惩罚的方式是破坏性的、适应不良的或者神经症性的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置777<br>或者将他人的行为解释为应该受罚，从而投射（projecting）他自己的倾向。他还可以合理化（rationalize）自己的行为，向自己或他人提供一大堆理由，从而使得本该受罚的行为成为不该受罚的行为——例如，他声称，他之所以打孩子，是为了孩子好。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置784<br>一个经常因为易于动怒而受罚的人，在下一次动怒前可以先从一数到十。如果在数数的过程中，他做出攻击性行为的倾向降低到了可控的水平，那么，他就可以避免受到惩罚了。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置788<br>惩罚性相倚联系还可以包括引导一个人去寻找或建构他在其中能够采取一些行为来取代受罚行为的环境。他会一天到晚忙着做一些不会受罚的事情，从而让自己远离麻烦，譬如坚持不懈地“做着其他一些事情”。（许多似乎不产生积极强化效果因而显得不合理的行为，可能具有取代受罚行为的作用。）个体甚至还可以采取措施来强化那些教导他不要做出受罚行为的相倚联系。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置795<br>通过创造一些行为不易受罚的环境，人们便可以减少受罚行为。还有一种可以采取的策略是打破那些使得受罚行为得到强化的相倚联系。另一种策略是安排环境，使得行为在其中可以发生，但不会受到惩罚。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置854<br>人们常常会告诉自己该做什么、不该做什么，但却往往忽略了这样一个事实，即他这样做，都是社会一直以来通过言语的方式教导他的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置874<br>善就像尊严或价值的其他方面一样，会随着可见控制的减弱而增强。当然，自由同样也是如此。因此，善与自由往往密切相关。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置899<br>一个人“打算怎么做”，通常取决于他过去做过的事情，以及在他做过这些事情之后所发生的事情。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置904<br><strong>“只有自由的人才能为自己的行为负责”</strong>，这一观点有两层含义，要看我们是对自由还是对责任感兴趣。如果我们想说人是负有责任的，那么我们就不能干涉他们的自由，因为如果他们没有行动的自由，他们就不能承担起责任。而如果我们想说人是自由的，那么我们就必须通过维持惩罚性相倚联系来促使他们为其行为负责，因为如果他们在明显不具有惩罚性的相倚联系下仍以同样的方式行事，那他们显然就是不自由的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置924<br>我们无法通过增强责任感来解决酗酒和青少年犯罪的问题。该为不良行为“负责”的是环境，必须要改变的也是环境，而不是个体的某种特性。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置944<br>酗酒者常常第一个声称自己生了病，而犯下了罪行的青少年则往往会说自己是不良环境的牺牲品。如果他们不用为自己的所作所为承担责任，那他们就不能受到公正的惩罚。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置948<br><strong>但现在人们普遍认为，没有愚笨的学生，只有不会教的教师；没有不好的孩子，只有不好的父母；青少年犯罪都是执法机构造成的；没有懒惰的人，只有不恰当的激励制度。当然，我们必须反问一句：为什么错的总是教师、父母、政府官员和企业家？正如我们在后面将会看到的，这种观点的错误在于：它总想把责任推给某个人，而且总认为其中存在着某种因果关系。</strong></p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置1007<br>一个人不会因为受过惩罚而不再以某种特定的方式行事，他至多能学会如何逃避惩罚而已。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023<br>放任自流（permissiveness）</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023<br>目前，有人已经严肃认真地提出用一种彻头彻尾的放任自流的做法来取代惩罚。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1038<br>助产士式的控制（the controller as midwife），一个人帮助另一个人“生出”行为。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1061<br>如果我们对一本书的内容已经滚瓜烂熟，或者如果我们对这本书的内容一窍不通，那我们是不会碰这本书的。我们愿意阅读的，通常是那些能帮助我们说出我们想说但又不能靠自己说出来的内容的书籍。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1071<br>行为是可以“培养”的。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1073<br>教师不能教，他只能帮助学生学。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1074<br>弗洛伊德认为，一个人的成长必须经历好几个发展阶段，</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1080<br>不过，只有施加控制，指导才会有效。指导意味着要开辟新的机会，或者阻止行为朝某个特定的方向发展。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1089<br>如果创造出一种环境，让人们在其中快速学会有效的行为，并持续有效地表现出这一行为，那无疑将很有价值。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1097<br>依赖于事物而不是依赖于他人的做法，其优点之一在于可以节省他人的时间和精力。一个人应当依赖的“事物”中，还包括那些没有专为改变他的行为而采取行动的人。依赖于事物还有一个重要的优点，那就是：与他人安排的相倚联系相比，与事物有关的相倚联系通常更为精确，且能塑造更为有用的行为。 事物的世界可能是一个专断、暴虐的世界。依赖于事物并不等于独立。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1125<br>一个人永远都不可能真正自立。即使他能有效地处理各种事情，他也必定依赖于那些曾经教他这样做的人。是这些人为他选定了他该依赖的事物，并决定了他依赖的形式和程度。（因此，他们不能推卸对结果所应承担的责任。）</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1137<br>任何人都不会对提示、暗示、建议做出任何反应，除非他已经拥有某种以某一特定方式行事的倾向。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1140<br>树立榜样也是在施加某种类似的控制，它利用了人们会模仿他人言行的一般性倾向。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1150<br>只有在个体已经有了某种行动的倾向时，敦促和劝说才会产生效果，而且，只要这种倾向无法解释，我们就可以把他的行为归因于一个内在人。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1172<br>我们可以改变一种行为发生的可能性，但我们改变不了需要。我们常以特定的方式来强化行为，但我们给不了一个人目的或意图。我们可以改变对待某物的行为，但改变不了对它的态度。我们可以抽取并改变言语行为，但改变不了观点。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1174<br>改变思想的另一种方式，是指明一个人以某种特定方式行为的原因，而这些原因几乎都可能相倚于行为的结果。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1199<br>像放任自流、助产术、指导、依赖于事物等方法一样，自由与尊严的捍卫者也对改变思想的方法持容忍的态度，因为它是一种不太有效的改变行为的方法，而且，改变思想者也可以因此而逃避指责，不让别人说他是在控制人。事情出错时，他也可以不用承担责任。这样，自主人就幸存了下来，他会因为所取得的成就受到褒奖，也会因为犯下的错误而受到指责。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1211<br>只有存在可利用的其他形式的控制时，控制最少的政府才是最好的政府。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1213<br><strong>自由经济并不意味着不要经济控制，这是因为，只要货物与金钱依然具有强化作用，经济就无自由可言。</strong></p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1295<br>通过说某物好或坏来进行价值判断，其实是根据这个物体的强化效果对其作一归类。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1388<br>正如我们已经看到的，公正或公平的问题常常不过是一个善于管理资源的问题。这个问题在于强化物是否得到了明智的运用。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1428<br>任何规则或法律都包含一条有关普遍相倚联系（可能是自然的相倚联系，也可能是社会性的相倚联系）的陈述。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值  - 位置1431<br>建筑工人戴上安全帽，从而遵守了一条规则。这里的自然相倚联系（涉及保护建筑工人不被下落物击中头部）并不十分有效，因而必须强制实施另一条规则：如果有建筑工人不戴安全帽，他就将被解雇。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1450<br>教育领域也是如此：非正式群体的成员通常在有意或无意指导之下相互学习，而有组织的教育则会雇用被我们称为教师的专家，让他们在特定的地方（即我们所说的学校）通过安排与特定强化物（如成绩、文凭）相关的相倚联系来进行教育。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1484<br>减少冲突，使用更为有力的强化物，增强相倚联系的作用，从而加强原初的控制。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1488<br>如果学生不学习，那不是因为他们对学习不感兴趣，而是因为学习标准太低，或者是因为所学的课程与一种让人满意的生活早已没有任何关联。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1496<br>第一步要做的是：确定一个人在为他人利益效力而受到控制时所能获得的利益有哪些。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1528<br>人作为一种社会性动物拥有一种优势，那就是：不需要亲自去发现所有的实践活动。</p>\n<p>第六章 价值 - 位置1537<br>人作为一种社会性动物还有另外一个优势：每一个个体归根结底都是“他人”中的一员，都会实施控制，而且，他们都是为了自己的利益而实施控制的。</p>\n<p>第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1590<br>人类学家经常强调，应该用这种能容忍不同观点的相对论来替代宗教狂热，因为宗教狂热力图将所有的文化都转化为一套单一的伦理、政府、宗教或经济方面的价值。</p>\n<p>第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1629<br><strong>文化是一套习俗体系，但不是一套不可与其他习俗体系相融合的体系。</strong></p>\n<p>第七章 一种文化的演进 -

卡斯托普没有什么时候不满怀热烈的向往，——我们知道喽，生活在这儿的冰天雪地里，使他喜欢回忆故乡柔软的沙滩，在回忆时心存感激。我们相信，我们提起这一美妙的失落之感，读者也会凭经验和回忆给我们响应。你在沙滩上走啊，走啊……这么走着，你将永远不会及时转身往回走，因为你已失落了时间，你已失落了自己。哦，大海，我们坐得远远儿地谈论着你，我们对你献上我们的思念、我们的爱恋，你呢，也该进入我们的故事，明明白白地，大声疾呼地，进入我们的故事，就像你永远静静地躺在我们的心中，过去这样，现在这样，将来还是这样……汹涌呼啸的无垠荒漠，顶上撑着灰白色的大幕，湿乎乎的空气侵袭人的皮肤，让我们嘴唇上老有盐碱味儿。我们走啊，走啊，走在富有弹性的沙地上，但见四处散乱着海草和小小的贝壳，耳边却被海风环绕。这博大、广袤而又柔和的风哦，它自由自在，无拘无束，坦坦荡荡，在辽阔的天地间刮来拂去，造成我们头脑里微微的迷醉，——我们继续漫步，漫步，看着海潮涌过来又退开去，任随它用泡沫翻卷的舌头，舔舐我们赤裸的双脚。潮水像煮沸了，色泽既明亮又幽暗，一浪高过一浪地喧嚣着，像绸缎一般摔打在平缓的岸边上，——极目望去，哪儿都如此，远方的浪峰上也如此，都是此起彼伏、沉浊持久的汹涌咆哮，搞得人的耳朵再也听不见世界的任何其他声音。深沉的快慰，有意的遗忘……让我们闭上眼睛，投进永恒的怀抱！可是不，你瞧啊，在那灰绿色的汹涌的远方，在那海面急速缩减成地平线的所在，浮着一只帆船。哪里？什么地方？有多远？有多近？你不知道了。你恍惚迷茫地失去了判断。要说出那帆船离岸边有多远，你必须知道船本身的体积有多大。是小而且近呢，还是大而且远？你的目光迷失在了无知之中，因为你本身没有任何器官和感官给你提供空间的信息……我们走啊，走啊，——走了已经多久？已经多远？这也不明不白。我们的脚步始终没有任何变化，这儿如同那儿，刚才如同现在和以后；时间溺死在了空间没有量度的单调中，从一个点移动到另一个点不再成为运动，如果周围全一个样儿的话；既然运动不再成为运动，那这里便不存在时间。\n\n中世纪的经院学家企图证明，时间只是幻觉，它的运行归根到底只是我们各种感官的产物，事物的真实存在只限定于恒定不变的现在。那位首先产生这种感想的博士，他可曾漫步海滨，——他的嘴唇是否尝到了永恒的淡淡苦涩滋味儿？我们无论如何得重申一下，我们这儿讲的只是度假的权利，只是闲暇时光的胡思乱想，它们很快就会让富有德行的智者厌烦，就像一个健壮的人会厌烦一动不动地躺在温暖的沙里。批评人的认识手段和形式，质疑它们的纯粹有效性，恐怕是荒唐、过分、心怀叵测的吧，要是其中夹杂了任何其他意念，而不是仅仅想给理想划出它不可逾越的界限，指明越过了界限，必然懈怠其本身的任务。像塞特姆布里尼先生这么一个人，我们只能心存感激，因为他告诉那个我们关心其命运的年轻人，那个遇上机会就让他优雅地称作“生活中的问题儿童”的青年，他以教育者的坚定口吻告诉他：形而上学乃是“邪恶的”东西。而我们呢，为了最好地缅怀一位受我们爱戴的死者，却要指出，批判原则的意义、意图和目的，只能是一个，也只允许是一个，这就是责任感，就是生活赋予的使命。是的，立法的智慧给理性划定了严格的界线，可同时也在这界线边上竖起了生活的旗帜，并且发出宣告，投身于这面旗帜之下，乃是人作为战士必须尽的职责。能把这算作原谅年轻的卡斯托普的理由吗？能设想是这使他更加沉溺于那些有关时间和永恒的胡思乱想，以致他那忧郁的军人表兄要喋喋不休地说他“狂热过度”，结果堪忧呢？\n","source":"_posts/魔山10.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

9826<br>时间可以讲述吗？那本原的、纯粹的时间本身，可以讲述吗？不能，确实不能，要讲就真是犯傻！就只能讲什么：“时间流动着，它在流逝，像江水似的流逝。”如此这般地一个劲儿往下讲，——恐怕没有一个神经健全的人会称这是在讲述故事。这好有一比，正如把同一个音符或者和弦拼命拖长到一小时，却称自己是在——演奏音乐一样。因为这“故事”和这“音乐”，两者之间有一个共同点，就是都消磨了时间，都“实实在在地填补了时间的空虚”，都对时间进行了“分割”，都使它“有了内容”，都让它“发挥了作用”，——在此我们怀着在引述死者遗言时应有的沉痛而虔诚的心情，引述已故约阿希姆偶尔说过的这些话，这些早已音沉响绝的话，——我们不知道读者是不是清楚，他说完这些话已经过去了多久。时间是故事的要素，正如它也是生命的要素，——故事和生命，它们都与时间密不可分，正如物体与空间密不可分。时间也是音乐的要素；音乐度量时间、分割时间，在使时间显得短促的同时变得可贵。如前所述，故事的情况也类似于此，同样只能循序渐进地、一点一点地进行展现，即使企图在任何一个瞬间得到充分的表现，也仍然须耗费时间。这与一劳永逸地呈现出来的造型艺术不同，造型艺术作品只是作为物体与时间发生联系。<br>","more":"<br>事情一目了然。不过两者的区别也显而易见。音乐的时间因素只是一码事，只是人类地球时间的一个断面，音乐注入这个断面，就使其变得说不出的高贵。故事相反有两种时间：一为其本身的时间，亦即构成其讲述和表现条件的音乐性实际时间；二为其内容所表现的时间，即透视性的时间，也就是故事的想象时间，它与实际时间的量度差异极大，既几乎可以甚至完全可以与音乐性实际时间相吻合，也可以与其相差十万八千里。一首名为《五分钟华尔兹》的乐曲确实演奏五分钟，——它与时间的关系仅止于此，别无其他。一则故事可就不同了，它的想象时间跨度仅为五分钟，可由于讲述得格外认真仔细，实际讲述时间就可以拖长一千倍——这时，时间显得短而容易度过，尽管对于故事的想象时间而言，它是很长很长的了。反过来故事的想象时间也可以用“浓缩法”将其自身无限扩展，——我们所谓的“浓缩法”，指的就是某种幻觉的或者干脆讲病态的因素，它显然适用于我们这里的情况；也就是故事的讲述采用神秘的魔法和时间的超透视法，它们让人想起了实际生活中的某些异常现象，以及明白无误的超感知状态。有一些吸食鸦片者的笔记表明，一个处于麻醉状态的瘾君子在短时间里体验到的迷幻情景，常常相当于十年、三十年甚至六十年或者超过了人所能设定的任何时间界限，——说的当然只是幻觉，只是其幻想时间大大超过了实际时间的长度；处于这样的迷幻状态，人对时间的体验浓缩到了难以置信的程度，幻象的情景急速地拥挤到一起，用一个吸食大麻者的话说，脑子已变得仿佛“像一块取走弹簧后不再有用的破表。”</p>\n<p>故事中的时间关系跟这里说的罪恶迷幻状态类似，也可以用类似的方式对它进行处理。不过既然能够“处理”，那就明摆着，时间这一故事要素也可变成故事处理的对象；这样一来，如果说“讲述时间的故事”还嫌过分的话，那么说想要讲讲有关时间的故事，就不显得像本章开始时我们感觉的那样完全荒谬了；——结果是“时间小说”这个名称，就有了奇特的梦幻般的双重含义。事实上我们最先提出时间是否可以讲述这个问题，只是为了承认我们讲述故事实际上也是要讲述时间。接着我们又问，那些聚集在我们周围的人是否清楚，自从已故的约阿希姆发表了那一通关于音乐与时间的议论——这样的议论原本不合他的天性，只能证明他体内的化学反应大大地增强了——至今已经过去多少时间，如果得到的回答是他们眼下真的不十分清楚，那我们也不会怎么生气；是的，不怎么生气，甚至还心满意足。之所以这样，原因很简单：大家都关注小说主人公本身的境遇体验，自然符合我们的利益；对现在讲到的这个时刻，汉斯· 卡斯托普本人绝非完全心中有数，而且早就已经不再有数了。这种情况，也是他的故事亦即一部时间小说的内容之一；过去如此——现在仍然如此。</p>\n<p>第七章 - 海滨漫步 &gt; 位置 9909<br>汉斯·卡斯托普目不转睛地盯着这颗秒针，想要阻止、拖延它几分钟，好让时光滞留在黑色的数字上。然而这针仍自顾自地一点一点迈步向前，根本不理那些数目字，只管走近它们、触及它们、越过它们、再抛开它们，与它们越抛越远、越抛越远，随后又重新开始，重新走近。这指针对时间、对分秒划分、对表盘刻度，统统麻木不仁。真希望它跳到了六十下能稍微停一停，或者至少发出一丝丝信息，让人知道这里有点事儿已经完成。然而，它那匆匆忙忙地、不加区别地越过一条条未标明数字的细线的神气，让人看出它路途上的所有数字和划线，对它来说统统不过是陪衬，因此它就只管走啊，走啊……就这样，汉斯·卡斯托普又把他这由玻璃表面罩着的玩意儿藏进背心口袋，任随时间自己流逝它的去。</p>\n<p>第七章

`的本质，人们普遍存在着多种错误的想法。总而言之，就是相信事情新鲜有趣，就能“驱赶”时间快跑，也就是使时间缩短；反之，单调空洞就会阻碍时间的行进，使行进变得艰难。这可不绝对正确。空洞单调固然可以将一瞬或一个钟头延伸，使它们变得“长而无聊”；但是，使用大的乃至最大的时间单位，就可缩短它们，甚至将它们化为乌有。反之，内容丰富有趣，就可以使一小时乃至一天缩短、加快，然而从大处着眼却赋予了时间的进程以宽度、重量和充实，以致事件频繁之年就比内容贫乏、空虚、让风也吹得跑的轻松年头过得慢得多，后者则稍纵即逝。所以，人们所谓时间长而无聊，实际上倒是由单调造成了时间病态的短促：由于不间断地老是一个样子，绵长的时间便萎缩了，以一种心灵惊惧得死去的方式萎缩了。如果一天像所有的天，那么所有的天也就只像一天。完全单调的生活，即使再长过起来也会十分短促，稍不注意便已逝去。习惯使时间意识淡漠或者说入睡。如果青年时代我们过起来觉得很慢，往后的生活却好像越来越快，真叫步履匆匆，那想必也是习惯了的缘故。我们大概都了解，时不时地改变习惯和养成新的习惯，是我们唯一能保持生机和新鲜的时间意识的方法，是我们唯一能使时间感受减慢、增强和变年轻，从而也更新自己的整个生命感的途径。我们变换居留地和空气，到温泉旅行，目的均在于此。这也就是时时变些花样，加些调剂，能使人精力充沛的原因。到一个新地方的头几天——大约六至八天吧——时间的步履总显得年轻，也就是说长而有力；随后，随着人“习惯”的程度加大，它就明显地逐渐缩短了。那种执著于生活的人，或者说得更正确些，那种希望抓紧生活的人，他们便会发现日子又变得轻飘飘地开始往前溜去，心中于是感到恐惧；而最后一个星期——我们就说总共四个星期吧——更将快得吓人，一晃便逝去了。自然，时间意识更新的效果会超出在异地呆的时间本身，人恢复常规的生活以后，还会显示出来，也就是回家后的头几天同样也会变得新鲜、实在和充满朝气，不过只有很少几天是如此罢了。人会很快重新习惯常规，要摒弃它却要慢一些。人的时间意识要是因为年纪增大而疲倦了，或者从来没得到过有力的发展——这是先天不足的表现，那它就会迅速入睡，只要二十四小时一过，人又觉得自己似乎从未离开家，旅行对于他只是夜里的一场梦而已。\n\n----\n[

<!--more-->\n生命是什么？谁也不知道。谁也不知道产生生命的那个原点，燃起生命之火的那个原点。没有什么直接来自这个原点，或者只是差强人意地在生的范畴内与这个点相连接；然而，生命本身却显得直接。如果对此可以讲些什么的话，那就是：生命的形式必定已经发展得十分高级，高级到了在无生命的世界里根本没有什么可与之伦比。在有伪足的阿米巴原虫和脊椎动物之间，进化的差距微乎其微，比起最简单的生命现象与那些连死都不配称的自然物之间的差距来，真叫微不足道。之所以讲“连死都不配称”，是因为它们乃无机物。须知死只是生的逻辑否定；可在生命与无生命自然界之间张开着一个巨大的深渊，科学界努力想在上面架起一座桥梁，结果只是徒劳。人们设法用各种理论来弥合这一鸿沟，结果鸿沟吞没了这些理论，鸿沟本身的深度和宽度却丝毫未因此而减少。为了找到中间起连结作用的环节，人们不惜荒谬地假设有一种无结构的生命物质，有一些未获得生机的有机体，它们可以在蛋白溶液中自行凝结成有机物质，就像水晶在母液中结晶一样——可实际上，有机的差异始终同时是一切生命的准备和表现，还找不出任何生物，其存在不归功于双亲的生育。有人因从海洋深处打捞起来了所谓的原液而欣喜若狂，最后还是出乖露丑了事。事实表明，是把石膏沉淀物当作原生物质了。可是为了避免在一个奇迹面前止步不前——须知所谓构成生命的物质跟无生命自然界相同，并且最后也分解为同样的物质，算得上是个奇迹喽。人们就不得不进一步相信另一个奇迹，即有机物产生于无机物的原初生殖理论。如此继续下去，就得想出一些中间环节和过渡阶段，就得假定存在一些比已知所有生物都更低级的生物，而这样的低等生物本身又还有自然生命冲动的先驱，即谁也见不到的所谓原虫；因为它在多么高倍数的显微镜下也不显现出来，而其假想的产生的前提，是必须完成蛋白质的……\n\n生命到底是什么？是温暖，是某种无定型的不稳定状态的热产物，是物质在发热发烧，是由此而来的不停分解和再生的复杂过程，以及伴随着不断产生结构精巧的蛋白分子的过程。这就是那原本不可能存在的东西的存在，这就是那在分解与再生的既复杂又热烈的过程中，甜蜜、痛苦而又艰难地在生存之点上保持着平衡的东西的存在。它既不具有物质性，也不是精神。它是介乎两者之间的某种东西，是一种现象，一种以物质为依托的现象，就像瀑布上的彩虹，就像火焰。可它尽管不具物质性，却富于感性，以致于有所欲求，有所厌恶，是变得敏感而易受刺激的物质的不知羞耻，是存在的放纵状态。这是宇宙的贞节冷漠中一点点隐秘而易感的悸动，是来自养料吸收和排泄的淫秽不洁的隐私，是来源和构成不明的碳酸气及其他有害污物的排放。这是通过其非稳定性而成为可能，并注定要按其形成法则进行的滋生漫长现象，也即要从水、蛋白质、盐和脂肪的某种蒸发物不断地衍生、成形，变成所谓的肉；而这肉不但会有形，而且会形象高贵，美丽动人，然而同时又是感性和欲望的化身。因为这形象和美丽与文学和音乐作品里不一样，没有精神作为依托，也没有中性的、消耗掉了精神、以无害的方式使精神感性化了的材料作为依托，如同雕塑中的形象和美那样。它们的依托和成形，主要靠的是那种不知怎么便有肉欲觉醒了的物质，是那种有机的、不断在腐朽和再生的物质本身，是发出臭气的肉……\n","source":"_posts/魔山5.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

- 晴天霹雳 > 位置 13050\n我们在哪里？这是怎么回事？梦境把我们抛到了何处？薄暮、暴雨、泥泞，晦暗的天空燃烧着残霞，沉闷的雷声不断地咆哮，空中充满着湿气，尖厉的啸叫撕裂耳膜，蜂拥奔来的地狱恶犬发出狂吠，其间夹杂着崩裂声、喷溅声、撞击声，熊熊燃烧声，乒乒乓乓，轰轰隆隆，鬼哭狼嚎，鼓点的节奏越来越快，越来越急迫……那边有座森林，林子里蹿出来一群群灰白的人影，奔跑着、扑跌着、跳跃着。那边是一线连绵起伏的丘陵，丘陵背后的远方燃起了大火，火苗不时地聚集成熊熊的烈焰。在我们四周是如波浪起伏的田野，但已给炸得满目疮痍，七零八落。泥泞的公路上撒满折断的树枝，像森林里一样；一条满是沟沟坑坑的小路接着公路，在通往丘陵时划了一个弧形，树木光秃秃地立在冷雨里，枝杈嶙峋……这儿有块路标，——可想凭它找路却白费劲儿；即使它没给炸裂开，字迹也让晦明的光线弄得模模糊糊。到底是东还是西？只知道这是一片平原，而且正在打仗。我们呢只是路旁一些畏畏缩缩的影子，并且由于享有影子的安全而怀着羞惭；我们压根儿想不到夸夸其谈、自吹自擂，而是本着老老实实讲故事的精神，讲那些从树林中蜂拥而出的灰色的士兵，讲他们如何奔跑、扑跌，如何爬起来擂着战鼓继续前进；讲他们中有一个我们认识，是我们多年的旅伴，他就是那个善良却有罪的青年，我们曾经时常听见他的声音，因此想在他从我们的视线中彻底消失之前，再凝视一下他那单纯的脸。\n\n战斗已经持续一整天，上级调这些兄弟们前来增援，是为重新夺回两天前落到了敌人手里的丘陵阵地，以及背后那些燃烧着的村庄。调来了一个志愿兵团，士兵全都年纪轻轻，多数是大学生，刚上战场不久。他们半夜被集合起来，坐了一通宵火车，天亮后冒雨行军一直走到下午，道路全糟糕透了，——有时根本没有路，公路被堵塞起来了，只好穿越田野和沼泽，一走走了七个小时，穿着又重又湿的军大衣，背着突击队的简单行装，这可不像郊游那样轻松喽。要知道谁也不愿意丢掉靴子，所以走一步就必须弯下腰，用手指抠住鞋舌头把靴子跟脚一起从黏黏的烂泥里拔出来。这样过一小块草地就得花一小时。眼下他们却赶到了，一切全仗着血气方刚，尽管激动又疲乏，他们却斗志旺盛，精力充沛，没法睡觉没法进食却照样挺了过来。他们浑身湿漉漉的，溅满了污泥，头上戴着蒙上灰布的钢盔，系钢盔的带子框住了脸庞，年轻的面孔依然红彤彤的。他们这么绯红着脸，是因为行军费劲儿吃力，是因为穿过泥泞的树林时目睹了自己遭受的伤亡。敌人侦察到了他们的行军路线，于是发射来榴霰弹和大口径的榴弹炮弹进行封锁，炮弹穿过林子散落进他们队伍中间，呼啸着、喷溅着、燃烧着，把大片林地狠狠地抽打、翻搅了一遍。\n\n他们必须穿过树林，这三千名热血沸腾的男孩子，他们作为增援部队，必须端起刺刀，去一起向那丘陵前后的战壕和燃烧的村庄发起冲锋，并坚决地冲到一个在命令里已经规定的地点；而这命令正藏在他们指挥官的皮包里。他们多达三千名；之所以这么多，意义就在于夺回了丘陵和村庄之后，他们还能剩下两千。他们是一个整体，一个即使付出了重大代价还有望继续战斗并取得胜利，并千口同声地对胜利发出“乌拉”的欢呼声的整体，——至于那些单个地牺牲掉了的人，当然不值一提。还有个别的人在急行军时就掉队了，这说明他太年轻、太脆弱。他脸色惨白，步履踉跄，咬着牙要求自己做个男子汉，可最终还是落下了。他硬撑着在大队伍边上跟了一段，后面的弟兄一群一群超过了他，随后他消失了，躺在了某个糟糕的地方。接着穿过弹片横飞的森林。可从林子里边涌出来的仍旧很多；三千之众足以经受住一次次放血，放血之后仍旧是支人头攒动的大部队。他们已经漫过经受了暴雨冲刷的大地、公路、小径和泥泞的田野，我们这些站在路旁观看的影子，便混迹在他们中间。在森林边上，训练有素地一批一批上好了刺刀，军号吹得哒哒哒响，战鼓擂得跟沉雷一般，于是弟兄们拼命向前冲锋，一边冲一边高声呐喊；不幸的只是双腿像梦里似的沉甸甸的，铅一般的土块粘在了他们的靴子上面。\n\n在呼啸而来的子弹前他们扑倒了，如果未被击中的话，又跳起来再往前冲，并勇敢地发出青春的呐喊。如果被击中了，子弹射进了额头、心脏或者肚肠，便胳膊乱伸两下，倒了下去，脸浸泡在泥污里，不再动弹。他们或者仰面倒下，背让军用背囊拱得老高，后脑勺钻进了泥地里，张开两手往空中乱抓。然而森林中不断涌出来新人，他们扑跌着、奔跑着、呐喊着，或者在死者中间踉跄着，向前冲去。\n\n这些背着背囊，端着刺刀，穿着肮脏的军大衣和皮靴的年轻小伙子！看着他们，你也很容易想象出另一些更合乎人道、更神圣美丽的画面。你可以想象：眼前是一片海湾，他们或者纵马疾驰，或者领着爱人在岸边漫步，嘴唇凑近温柔的姑娘耳畔窃窃私语，或者相互指点着练习张弓射箭。可现实却是另一番景象，却是鼻子掩埋在充满硝烟味儿的污泥里。尽管心中无比恐惧，怀着对母亲和故土的无尽思念，他们仍然乐于捐躯，因为这本身就是一件崇高的事情，即使并没有真正的理由要走到这一步。\n","source":"_posts/魔山11.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

8167<br>那是肮脏的立场，塞特姆布里尼宣布，是愚蠢的观点，对这样的观点他几乎不屑于驳斥。因为“神圣的地位”也罢，工程师跟别人讲的“基督教对苦难的敬重”也罢，统统都是谎言，都建立在欺骗、妄断和心理错觉上面。健康人同情生病的人，并将同情提高为敬重，是因为他简直无法设想，要是换上自己该如何才能忍受那样的苦难——这同情被严重地夸大了，跟病人毫无关系，只是一个思维和幻想的错误结果，表现在健康人把自己的体验方式强加给了生病的人，仿佛后者也是一个不得不承受病人的痛苦的健康人似的——这完完全全是个错觉。病人就是病人，有着病人的脾性和改变了的感受方式；疾病造就了病人，使他与它相安无事，谁也离不开谁；还有感知力的减弱、丧失、麻痹，以及自然的种种精神和道德的适应与缓解措施，都被健康人天真地忽略了。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8242<br>依他的看法，在这儿胡诌什么人类的尊严实属荒谬，因为我们真正的尊严存在于精神中，而不存在于肉体里；人的心灵太过分倾向于从肉体中去吸取整个生命之乐，给肉体一些疼痛因而就成了绝对值得提倡的手段，用它可以败坏感官享乐的胃口，就像将乐趣从肉体中赶出来，让它回到精神中去，以便精神重新取得统治地位。把笞刑指责为尤其可鄙的手段，是很愚蠢的。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8267<br>“于是便有了死尸般的盲从一说！”</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8272<br>土葬这种办法真是太陈旧、太过时了——在现代的环境条件下！城市扩张！大量吞食土地的墓园！飞涨的地价！不得不使用现代交通手段使葬礼合理化！塞特姆布里尼先生对这一切都知之甚详，言之凿凿。他特别嘲笑那种老鳏夫，还学他们弯腰驼背地每天去亡妻坟前的样子，说是去那儿和她谈谈知心话。这样的老古董该首先享用可贵的生命财富，好好度过自己所剩无多的光阴才是。再说，现代化大公墓里人挨着人，对于他们思念故旧的悠悠情怀，不也很煞风景吗？让烈焰来消灭尸体，这是多么干净卫生，多么庄严高尚，比起任它自行腐烂和蛆虫咬噬的可悲结局来，简直可以讲富有英雄气概！是啊，使用这种新的方法，心灵——人对永久存在的需要——也可以得到满足。因为在火中消失了的，原本就是那些变化着的东西，那些人体里尚在出生前就处于新陈代谢状态的成分；至于另一些很少参加新陈代谢而不变地陪伴着人一辈子的成分，也就能经住火烧，也就变成了骨灰。因此，活着的人搜集收藏骨灰，就等于将故去亲人身体里永不泯灭的一部分珍藏起来了。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8282<br>噢，那还用说。塞特姆布里尼打算抓住人类对生物学事实的非理性态度不放。他指的是那些原始信仰的阶段，那时候死是一种恐怖，始终被令人战栗的神秘气氛包围着，因此人不能用理性的清醒目光去审视这一自然现象。有多野蛮啊！对死的恐惧发源于文明程度极低的时代，那时人通常都死于暴力；而事实上这样的横死总带着可怖的性质，久而久之，人一想到死，自然就感到害怕。可是，随着整个健康科学的越来越发达，个人的安全越来越有保障，自然死亡便成为常事；而对于一个劳动者来说，在辛勤一生之后想到永久地安息更一点不觉可怕，倒认为是正常的值得欢迎的了。不，死既非可怖的事，也非殉难牺牲；死纯粹是一种合乎理性的、生理学上必然的和值得欢迎的现象。不过再没完没了地讨论这个问题，将是对生命的剥夺。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8328<br>他们不是“人形动物”，塞特姆布里尼先生纠正说；那是些人，跟他、工程师、以及发言者本身一样的人——只是这些人意志薄弱，成了不健全的社会的牺牲品。他讲到一个重罪犯人，一个杀死多人的凶手，属于检察官们在最后的公诉状中习惯地称之为“兽性的”或“人形禽兽”一类。这个人却在牢房的四壁写满了诗句，而且写得很不坏；这些诗句——比起他的检察官们偶尔心血来潮的创作来，不知要好多少倍。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8349<br>不错。罪犯自然会全身心渗透着犯罪意识。因为罪犯就是罪犯，不可能也愿意成为别样的人；而这正是罪恶的本性。纳夫塔先生将罪恶与功勋的概念从经验范畴提升到了形而上的范畴。他说，在行为和行动中自然是前定的因素起决定作用，无所谓自由可言，但存在中显然有自由。人正好是他想要成为的那个样子，而且至死不会改变；他正是“为他的生”而乐于杀人，因此也就以他的生命作为偿还，这并不过分。他希望死，因为他已得到了最大的满足。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8363<br>纳夫塔证实，德行和健康确实不是虔诚的状态。如果弄清楚了信仰与理性和道德根本没任何关系，他说，那就收获不小。须知，他补充说，信仰与生活毫无牵连。生活所依赖的条件和基础，一部分属于认识的范畴，一部分属于道德的范畴。前者系时间、空间和目的，后者指伦理和理性。所有这一切对于信仰来说不只是异己的和无意义的，而且是敌对的；须知正是它们构成了生命存在，构成了所谓健康，也就是市民的本性和庸俗平凡。而信仰世界，肯定是其绝对的反面，而且是绝对天才的反面。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8381<br>“好一盘令人作呕的大杂烩！”塞特姆布里尼大声呵斥。善与恶，光明与黑暗，一切全搅和在一起！没有判断！没有意志！但有谴责该受谴责的东西的能力！纳夫塔先生是否知道，他在青年耳边将上帝与魔鬼混为一谈，并假杂乱无章的二位一体之名否定伦理的原则，他这么做结果到底否定了什么？他否定了价值——否定了任何价值判断本身——说来叫人恶心！太妙啦，不再有善恶之分，只有一个伦理上混混沌沌的宇宙！也不存在各有其批判价值的个体，只存在包容一切、平衡一切的整体，只存在整体里神秘的沉沦。个人……</p>"},{"title":"企鹅经典：《魔山》摘录

8883\n海平线挺高，宽阔的海面像还在变宽，这是因为汉斯·卡斯托普从相当高处俯瞰着海湾。山脉延伸着，突出到海中，形成长满树丛的海角，到了海湾中心又折回来形成一个半圆，逶迤直至他坐的地方并继续向前。这是一道岩岸，他蹲在让太阳晒热了的石级上。在他面前，由长满苔藓和灌木丛的巨岩构成从高到低的陡坡，渐渐演变为平缓的海滩。在那儿，在芦苇丛中，被海潮冲洗圆滑了的石头再围成无数蓝色的湾仔、小港和水塘。这块阳光灿烂的土地，这道高峻的岩岸，这片活泼愉快的滩头，还有大海、小岛以及岛与岛之间往来穿梭的船儿，真是远远近近无处不住着人，无处没有南国的阳光和大海养育的孩子们在活动和休息，一个聪明、愉快、美丽、年轻的人类，望着他们真是件美事——汉斯·卡斯托普为领受这美妙的感觉，大大地敞开心扉，痛苦而爱慕地敞开了心扉。\n\n小伙子们嬉闹着骑马狂奔，马嘶鸣着，扬鬃奋蹄。有几匹烈马，他们只好放长缰绳拽住，要不就骑在光光的马背上，用赤脚夹击马腹，赶着它们向大海冲去。阳光中，小伙子们背部的肌肉在古铜色的皮肤下颤动，他们对牲口或者彼此发出的吆喝声，不知怎的听起来异常迷人。在一片像山间湖泊似的倒映着岩岸的小海湾前，有一群年轻姑娘在跳舞。一位将颈后的头发特别富于魅力地在头上挽成髻子的少女，坐在一旁吹奏牧笛伴舞；她眼睛不看手指，而望着她的女友。舞女们长裙飘飘，或笑盈盈地舒展着双臂独舞，或耳鬓厮磨，成对成双，舞步翩跹。坐在她们背后吹牧笛的少女白皙而苗条，由于手臂弯着，侧面看上去较丰满。另一些女友或坐着，或相互搂着站在一起，边看边轻声交谈。还有一伙青年男子在练习射箭。汉斯· 卡斯托普心中油然生起幸福、快慰的感情，他看见年长者如何指导初学的小毛头张弓、搭箭，和他们一块儿瞄准目标，如何笑呵呵地去扶持被弓的反弹力弄得站立不稳的后生学子，而在前一个瞬间，箭矢已嗖的一声射出去了。还有些人在钓鱼。他们有的趴在岸边的石板上，一条小腿在空中晃来晃去，让鱼线垂在海水中，歪着脑袋，悠悠闲闲地与旁边的钓友答话；这一位呢，则仰着身子坐着，将钓饵甩得老远。还有一些人在干活儿，正拉的拉、顶的顶、推的推，把一艘船舷高高的带桅杆的大船送下海去。孩子们在防浪木中间跑跳着，欢叫着。一个少妇摊开四肢仰卧在沙滩上，眼睛望着后方，一只手撩开胸前的花衣服，一只手去抓头顶上带叶的果子；那是一个健壮男人伸长胳膊悬在她头上逗她的，叫她可望而不可即。人们或倚靠在岩隙缝中；或迟疑着是不是下海游泳，用手臂交叉抱着自己的肩，伸出脚尖去试水温。成对的情侣漫步海滩，男的把嘴凑到女的耳朵边上，悄悄说着情话。白毛长长的羊群在石坡山上跳来跳去。年轻牧人一手叉腰，一手扶着牧杖站在高处，他生有一头棕色鬈发，戴着一顶后面的边沿卷起来的小毡帽。\n\n第六章 - 雪 > 位置 8948\n“我想，我是在做梦吧，”他自言自语地喃喃着，“梦得美妙极了，可怕极了。从根本上讲，我一直清楚这是个梦，一切都是我自己想出来的——那树木繁茂的园子和滋润的空气，以及接下去的美好景象与可怕情景，我几乎全都预先知道。我怎么会知道这些，想出这些，使自己感到幸福，感到恐怖呢？我从哪儿弄来那迷人的海湾，还有那由一个美少年的目光引导我走进去的神庙群呢？我想说，一个人不单单靠自己的心灵做梦，也代替匿名的集体做梦，只不过以个人的方式。你只是那巨大心灵的一个微小分子，它通过你做梦，以你的方式，梦见一些它永远悄悄在梦想着的事物——梦见它的青春，它的希望，它的幸福，它的安宁……它的人肉宴。眼下我倚靠着自己的圆柱，头脑里实际还留着我的梦的残余，留着对人肉宴的冰冷的恐惧，以及对先前美景的由衷的喜悦——为那光明人类的幸福和高尚情操而感到的喜悦。这是属于我的，我坚持认为，我有不可剥夺的权利靠在这儿，做这样的梦。我从此地山上的人们那里知道了许多乱七八糟的东西以及理性的东西。我跟着纳夫塔和塞特姆布里尼，在极其危险的崇山峻岭中转来转去。我了解人的一切。我认识人的肉和血，我把普希毕斯拉夫· 希培的铅笔还给了有病的克拉芙迪娅· 舒舍。可是谁认识肉体，认识生命，他也就认识死。不过，这并非全部——多半还只是个开端，如果从教育的角度看问题的话。还必须加上另外一半，相对的一半。要知道，一切对疾病和死亡的兴趣，不过是对生命的兴趣的一种表现方式而已，正如人道主义的医学科学所证明的那样。这种学科总在彬彬有礼地用拉丁文谈论生命及其病患，仅仅是那个巨大而急迫的问题的一方面；我现在要直呼其名，怀着无比的好感和同情：那就是生活的问题儿童的问题，就是人和人的地位与尊严问题……我对此懂得不少，从此地山上的人那儿学到了许多。我从平原被赶上高山，可怜我几乎喘不过气来；然而，从我的圆柱脚下，我这会儿挺不坏地看见了全貌……我梦见人的地位，梦见他们那个明达知礼、互敬互爱的群体，但在这个群体背后的神庙中，却上演着吃小孩的可怕一幕。他们，太阳的孩子们，在静静地观看那可怕的情景时，相互还会一样的文质彬彬，殷勤友善吗？他们要是能这样，那可真叫风雅、大度！我从心眼儿里同情他们，而不同情纳夫塔，也不同情塞特姆布里尼，他们俩都是空谈家。一个放荡而邪恶，一个只会吹理性的小号角，还自以为用目光能震住疯子，真叫人倒胃口。说来说去，不过是庸人哲学，纯粹的道德说教，非宗教思想。同样，我对纳夫塔，对他的宗教，也不怀好感；他的宗教只是把上帝与魔鬼、善与恶搅混成一个大杂烩，正好让人一头栽进去，以达到神秘地沉沦在一般之中的目的。这两位教育家！他们的争论和矛盾本身也不过是个大杂烩，是一片乱糟糟的厮杀声，谁只要脑子稍稍自由一点，心灵稍稍虔诚一点，就不至于被蒙蔽。谈什么贵族化问题！什么高贵不高贵！什么死与生，疾病与健康，精神与自然！难道它们是矛盾？我要问：难道它们是问题？不，这不成问题。还有高贵不高贵也不成问题。死必然寓于生之中，没有必然的死也便没有生；主的人的地位正处于中央、处于混乱与理性之间，正像他的国度也处于神秘的集团与不稳定的个体之间。从我的圆柱往下看去，情形就是这样。处在这个地位上，他应该彬彬有礼，自己对自己表现得友善谦恭——因为只有他是高贵的，而非矛盾冲突。人应主宰矛盾冲突，而不是相反。也就是说，人比矛盾冲突更加高贵，比死也更高贵，对于死来说太高贵了——这便是他头脑的自由思想；比生更高贵，对于生来说太高贵了——这便是心灵的虔诚信仰。这就是我做的诗，一首关于人的梦幻之诗。我愿铭记着它。我愿做个善良人。我不容许死亡统治我的思想！因为善良与仁爱存在于我的思想中，不存在于任何其他地方。死是巨大的威力。人摘下帽子对它表示敬畏，然后便踮起脚尖擦过它身边，继续前进。死戴着往昔的庄严领圈，人们为了对它表示敬意，也穿着黑色的丧衣。理性在它面前显得一副蠢相，因为理性仅仅是道德，死却是自由、混乱、无定型和欲。欲，我的梦说，不是爱。死与爱——这是差劲儿的一对儿，乏味的一对儿，很不和谐的一对儿！爱是死的对头，只有爱，而非理性，能战胜死。还有形式，也只产生于爱与善：一个明智友善的团体，一个美好的人类之国的形式和礼仪——在静观着人肉筵时也不改变。啊，我就这么清楚地梦见了，就这么很好地‘执了政’！我要铭记着它。我要在心中对死保持忠诚，然而又牢记不忘：对死和往昔的忠诚只会造成邪恶、淫欲和对人类的敌视，要是任凭它支配我们的思想和‘执政’的话。为了善和爱的缘故，人不应让死主宰和支配自己的思想。到这儿我该醒了……因为我的梦已做完，已到达目的地。我早就在寻找这个词：到达目的地，在希培出现的地方，在我的阳台上，在随便哪儿。也是为了寻找这个目的地，我身不由己来到了风雪山野中。现在我找到了它。我的梦将它再清楚不过地铭刻在我心中，我将永远牢记。是的，我欢欣鼓舞，热血沸腾。我的心有力地跳着，我知道为什么。它这样跳不仅仅出于身体的原因，不像尸体还会长指甲似的；它跳得更富人情味，更多是因为心灵幸福的缘故。心灵的幸福是一种佳酿——我梦里的词儿——比波尔多葡萄酒和英国啤酒都醇美，像爱和生命一般流贯我周身的血管，使我猛然从睡梦里苏醒过来。我自然知道得很清楚，我年轻的生命在睡梦中处于极度的危险……醒一醒，醒一醒！睁开眼睛！在雪地里，是你的脚，是你的腿！将它们收拢，站直！快瞧——天气好了！”\n\n第六章 - 好样儿的士兵 > 位置 9179\n您瞧，造成世界混乱的根源，就在于精神的迅速进步与物质的惰性和发展极其迟缓之间的不协调。必须承认，这种不协调足以用来为精神对现实的漠不关心作辩护；须知，通常的情况都是精神早已对那些引起革命的酵素讨厌到了作呕的程度。事实上，对于鲜活的精神来说，死去了的精神比某些玄武岩还可恶，因为玄武岩至少并不要求人家承认它们为精神和生命。可往昔的现实残余结成的玄武岩，它们远远被精神抛在了背后，失去了与现实这个概念的任何联系，却凭借惰性继续存在着、维持着，乏味到了不自觉其乏味的程度。我只是一般言之，您却可以用我的话去观察那种人道主义的自由思想，它自以为在当今反对统治与权威的斗争中还可以充作英雄气概。唉，还有那些它借以证明自己的生命力的种种灾难，那些它准备有朝一日庆祝的迟到而虚幻的种种胜利！一想到这些，鲜活的精神便无聊得要死，岂知事实上恰恰只有它，将在这些灾难中成为唯一的胜利者和受益者——它，将融汇过去的因素与远大的未来于一身，成为真正的革命……\n","source":"_posts/魔山9.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

卡斯托普心中油然生起幸福、快慰的感情，他看见年长者如何指导初学的小毛头张弓、搭箭，和他们一块儿瞄准目标，如何笑呵呵地去扶持被弓的反弹力弄得站立不稳的后生学子，而在前一个瞬间，箭矢已嗖的一声射出去了。还有些人在钓鱼。他们有的趴在岸边的石板上，一条小腿在空中晃来晃去，让鱼线垂在海水中，歪着脑袋，悠悠闲闲地与旁边的钓友答话；这一位呢，则仰着身子坐着，将钓饵甩得老远。还有一些人在干活儿，正拉的拉、顶的顶、推的推，把一艘船舷高高的带桅杆的大船送下海去。孩子们在防浪木中间跑跳着，欢叫着。一个少妇摊开四肢仰卧在沙滩上，眼睛望着后方，一只手撩开胸前的花衣服，一只手去抓头顶上带叶的果子；那是一个健壮男人伸长胳膊悬在她头上逗她的，叫她可望而不可即。人们或倚靠在岩隙缝中；或迟疑着是不是下海游泳，用手臂交叉抱着自己的肩，伸出脚尖去试水温。成对的情侣漫步海滩，男的把嘴凑到女的耳朵边上，悄悄说着情话。白毛长长的羊群在石坡山上跳来跳去。年轻牧人一手叉腰，一手扶着牧杖站在高处，他生有一头棕色鬈发，戴着一顶后面的边沿卷起来的小毡帽。</p>\n<p>第六章
