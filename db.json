回忆\n\n记得刚开始的时候，你对我是拒绝的，也算是经过了蛮长的拉扯，我也说过要放弃的话。现在我可以坦诚地说，那些要放弃的话，只是一种策略，一种让你放下包袱来认真理解彼此的一种策略。否则，一个多年不见的老同学，见了一次面就跑去说喜欢这种话，搁我身上，我也不会信的，一个随便就说出我喜欢你这种话的人，又能有多大的信任度呢？那天表白的时候，本来打算电话表白的，可是你总是选择不接我电话，是啊，从那个时候，你就喜欢不接我的电话，也经常消失。也想过跑去西安对你表白，你也总是拒绝我的出现，我怕贸然跑过去，会显得很尴尬。所以，最后是在微信上表白的，到现在我都还是觉得蛮遗憾的，我欠你一个浪漫的开场，一度想补上，机会就溜走了那么多，那么多。\n\n我跑去找你的次数，依然屈指可数，正因为屈指可数，才显得弥足珍贵，可是你总是“凶巴巴”地拒绝我的出现，我连吵架都不会，所以之前你每次凶我的时候，我都选择避让，然后旁边配一个可怜巴巴地表情。现在，我渐渐开始理解，其实凶巴巴，那并不是真的你，那只是你的一部分，那只是你的一种表达方式，只要是表达方式就无关好坏，对方理解了就行，我想我现在开始理解你了。还记得那个我误机的夜晚吗？在分别前特别想抱一下你，当我靠近你的时候，你一句“不要碰我”，把我吓回去了，所以到最后都没有给你一个结实的拥抱，特别后悔为什么不强行抱你一下，我想我是怕被当作流氓被打一顿吧。所以那晚在我误机之后，我又跑回市区去了，打了那个假装要放弃的电话。\n\n你是我遇见的第一个对对方有异性朋友那么在意的人，这也是你一度想答应我，但是又没有答应我的原因。我不太确定我能够能否足够理解这种想法，我一直认为有这种想法的人，只要给予足够多的信任，分享相互的朋友圈，随时报备，多表达，多沟通，给你看我的手机，你就会放下这种芥蒂，但现在看来是失败的方式。这些行为并没有打消你的顾虑，反而加重了你对我的不信任感，这的确让我意外。难道这些行为并不是因为不自信，而是因为控制欲？不是因为害怕对方被异性朋友抢走，而是证明对方为自己一人所有？可是我的心也的确是为你一个人所拥有啊？我甚至在你还没有明确答应我的时候，遇到异性我会宣称我有女朋友，冒着有可能丢脸的风险，也要帮你宣誓主权。可说到底，你没有对我说过“你只想一个人拥有我”这种话，所以我很困惑，我又该怎么办呢？\n\n这个世界上没有人可以解答我的困惑，除了你。除了你没有别人，只有你把你的心中所想表达出来，如果我做的不对，也只有你才能为我指出来，这个世界没有人不会犯错，携手才能共进，同步才有共创美好。你总是轻易地说出放弃这种话，是啊，痛苦的爱情谁愿意坚持下去。但是我们之间为什么就一定是痛苦的爱情，出了问题为什么不是通过沟通来解决的呢？为什么第一选项就一定要是放弃呢？过去几个月，我努力展现的是多样的我自己，我有很多面，我想你也有所发现了，来谈恋爱吧，在这里你可以体验那么多的恋爱。\n\n人都是分阶段成长的，爱情也是。当初你的那种直率，纯真，可爱依然吸引着我，我也坚信我并没有选错，只是在中间有些细节跑偏了。不知道我给你留下的好感，还存在多少，无论存在多少，我都希望能够继续增加这种好感，而不是抹杀这些好感，恋爱就是要一起共同成长。我记得和你说过，喜欢就要表达出来，那是因为我害怕不表达出来，就错失了表达的机会。我每天的“我喜欢你”就是对平白开场的一种弥补，也是一种爱意溢出来的真诚。\n\n我喜欢你，只要有机会，我就想对你说一次，如果可以的话，我希望能够对你说千万次，亿万次，希望能够在余生的光辉中对你的喜欢永不停止。\n\n友情提示，本公众号，可以在后台回复单字“冉”获取精彩回答。\n","source":"_drafts/告白.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

过去几个月的阅读内容\n本来在去年年底（即2017年）的时候，打算写一篇过去一年的总结的，但是写了一半，戛然而止，写不下去，这就是对那段时间自己心态的完美总结，在仔细思索了两个月后，虽然中间也让自己放纵了一段时间，我决定在年后（今天是2018年2月26，节后正式上班的第一天）写点儿什么东西，否则郁积在心中又会被我拖延下去，了无尽头。本来打算分好几篇文章来写的，但是最近两个月读的几本书，都没有足够的精力去把他们变成一篇很长的文章，所以就简短地介绍一些自己看完这几本书之后想到的一些问题吧，后面想到了不错的主题再单独另开一篇文章吧。\n\n今年1月份，看了两本书，一本书是《繁荣的代价》，一本书是《以读攻读》。\n\n第一本举了一些例子来证明繁荣所导致的通病，通篇提供的都是描述繁荣所引发的现象，我原本以为，我会在这本书中看到关于儒家文化的思考，但是很遗憾，他只举了一个日本明治维新的例子，日本在明治维新之后，依然保存了大娘原本的文化，观察现象本来就是好的，虽然本书没有提供关于这些现象很深入的探究，但是总结观察到的现象也的确是能够帮我们去引发思考。繁荣的通病总是有那么多，比如繁荣导致低生育率，低生育率导致人口减少，人口减少之后就需要移民来填充，移民多了之后就无法保持国家民族的向心力，虽然这个现象貌似在我们过往的岁月里出现的少，但是这就是繁荣有可能导致，比如日本现在的人口就在减少，但是他们没有奔溃，有关键的一点，觉得应该是因为移民少，所以民族的向心力还在，虽然青壮年的劳动力减少，但是经济增长的点依然存在，所以他们现在依然是GDP第三。所以关于我们自己今后的走向，是否有所启迪呢？再看。\n\n第二本书是一个英文教授[但汉松](https://weibo.com/p/1005051769741763)写过的一些书评，然后出了一个总的合集，写的蛮不错的，关于文学理论方面于我而言可能也就是稍稍涉足一下吧。\n\n2月，很遗憾，只读完了一本书《春之祭-第一次世界大战和现代的开端》，因为过年回家，所以补了很多旧番，比如《少女终末旅行》、《狂赌之渊》、《东京食尸鬼》、《野良神》，不再次赘述。\n\n《春之祭》，原本是一部芭蕾舞剧，首演于1913年（也就是第一次大战的前一年），当即引发了巨大的争议和褒奖，批判与内省就成了一个现代艺术的一个巨大引子，德国的宣战也不是为了侵犯别人的土地，只是为了防御别人的进攻，并且打击英法（是那种瞧不起的争斗，而不是为了攫取利益），他们相互鄙视，但是也会有在开战后相互跑到对方的阵地去庆祝圣诞节。这就是一战，存在主义，虚无主义，达达主义，一切关于现代主义的开始都来自那个时代的斗争中，一战结束后，英国的工党开始强大起来，很多我们现在所熟悉观念开始诞生与演化，德国极权下的无政府主义开始生根发芽，开始有了法西斯主义，开始有了二战。历史总是有迹可循的，历史总是背离我们，也总是在影响我们，我们究竟是不是还要走一样的路呢？我们现在这个国家不是和二战后的德国的政府形式很像吗，也许只是我才疏学浅，看不透吧。\n\n# 关于职业发展的问题\n除此之外，便是关于现在自己的职业生涯路怎么走的问题。我究竟要做什么，如何做，没人会给我一个良好的回答，这个回答究竟是什么，每每想到这里我就宁愿停笔不写，可是问题依然还是存在的，并不会因为我不作为就不存在了。\n\n互联网是什么呢？在我的理解中，互联网本质上是人的连接，打破这种连接，缔结新的连接，这就是互联网。要做好一个互联网产品，产品、技术、运营、交互设计，缺一不可，现在已经过了随随便便就能获取大量用户的时代了，这些东西就显得尤为重要了。如果做好一个公司呢？公司的组织架构、薪酬体系、舵手的魄力与远见、合适的工作氛围，这些东西能够帮助公司走的很远，做的很大，究竟该如何去做，做到何种程度，依然没有一个思考的结果，坐而论道不如起而远行。如何才是一个良好的做事方式呢？期望管理、问题分析方法等等，又有那些是适合我自己的呢？说到底，于我而言，这些东西还是不存在一个是否合适的问题，因为能够完全由我决定的东西还是太少了，如论如何，走下去，也便只能言尽于此了。\n","source":"_posts/2018-02-26.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

id=\"关于职业发展的问题\">关于职业发展的问题</h1>\n<p>除此之外，便是关于现在自己的职业生涯路怎么走的问题。我究竟要做什么，如何做，没人会给我一个良好的回答，这个回答究竟是什么，每每想到这里我就宁愿停笔不写，可是问题依然还是存在的，并不会因为我不作为就不存在了。</p>\n<p>互联网是什么呢？在我的理解中，互联网本质上是人的连接，打破这种连接，缔结新的连接，这就是互联网。要做好一个互联网产品，产品、技术、运营、交互设计，缺一不可，现在已经过了随随便便就能获取大量用户的时代了，这些东西就显得尤为重要了。如果做好一个公司呢？公司的组织架构、薪酬体系、舵手的魄力与远见、合适的工作氛围，这些东西能够帮助公司走的很远，做的很大，究竟该如何去做，做到何种程度，依然没有一个思考的结果，坐而论道不如起而远行。如何才是一个良好的做事方式呢？期望管理、问题分析方法等等，又有那些是适合我自己的呢？说到底，于我而言，这些东西还是不存在一个是否合适的问题，因为能够完全由我决定的东西还是太少了，如论如何，走下去，也便只能言尽于此了。</p>"},{"title":"ALAYNE","date":"2016-04-06T12:59:24.000Z","comments":0,"_content":"## ALAYNE\\--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\n\nShe was reading her little lord a tale of the Winged Knight when Mya Stone came knocking on the door of his bedchamber, clad in boots and riding leathers and smelling strongly of the stable. Mya had straw in her hair and a scowl on her face. That scowl comes of having Mychel Redfort near, Alayne knew.\n\n“Your lordship,” Mya informed Lord Robert, “Lady Waynwood’s banners have been seen an hour down the road. She will be here soon, with your cousin Harry. Will you want to greet them?”\n\nWhy did she have to mention Harry? Alayne thought. We will never get Sweetrobin out of bed now. The boy slapped a pillow. “Send them away. I never asked them here.”\n<!-- more -->\nMya looked nonplussed. No one in the Vale was better at handling a mule, but lordlings were another matter. “They were invited,” she said uncertainly, “for the tourney. I don’t… “\n\nAlayne closed her book.  “Thank you, Mya. Let me talk with Lord Robert, if you would.”\n\nRelief plain on her face, Mya fled without another word.\n\n“I hate that Harry,” Sweetrobin said when she was gone. “He calls me cousin, but he’s just waiting for me to die so he can take the Eyrie. He thinks I don’t know, but I do.”\n\n“Your lordship should not believe such nonsense,” Alayne said. “I’m sure Ser Harrold loves you well.” And if the gods are good, he will love me too. Her tummy gave a little flutter.\n\n“He doesn’t,” Lord Robert insisted. “He wants my father’s castle, that’s all, so he pretends.” The boy clutched the blanket to his pimply chest. “I don’t want you to marry him, Alayne. I am the Lord of the Eyrie, and I forbid it.” He sounded as if he were about to cry. “You should marry me instead. We could sleep in the same bed every night, and you could read me stories.”\n\nNo man can wed me so long as my dwarf husband still lives somewhere in this world. Queen Cersei had collected the head of a dozen dwarfs, Petyr claimed, but none were Tyrion’s. “Sweetrobin, you must not say such things. You are the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, and you must wed a highborn lady and father a son to sit in the High Hall of House Arryn after you are gone.”\n\nRobert wiped his nose. “But I want — “\n\nShe put a finger to his lips. “I know what you want, but it cannot be. I am no fit wife for you. I am bastard born.”\n\n“I don’t care. I love you best of anyone. “\n\nYou are such a little fool.  “Your lords bannermen will care. Some call my father upjumped and ambitious. If you were to take me to wife, they would say that he made you do it, that it was no will of yours. The Lords Declarant might take arms against him once again, and he and I should both be put to death.”\n\n“I wouldn’t let them hurt you!” Lord Robert said. “If they try I will make them all fly.” His hand began to tremble.\n\nAlayne stroked his fingers. “There, my Sweetrobin, be still now.” When the shaking passed, she said, “You must have a proper wife, a trueborn maid of noble birth.”\n\n“No. I want to marry you, Alayne.”\n\nOnce your lady mother intended that very thing, but I was trueborn then, and noble. “My lord is kind to say so.” Alayne smoothed his hair. Lady Lysa had never let the servants touch it, and after she had died Robert had suffered terrible shaking fits whenever anyone came near him with a blade, so it had been allowed to grow until it tumbled over his round shoulders and halfway down his flabby white chest. He does have pretty hair.  If the gods are good and he lives long enough to wed, his wife will admire his hair, surely.  That much she will love about him. “Any child of ours would be baseborn. Only a trueborn child of House Arryn can displace Ser Harrold as your heir. My father will find a proper wife for you, some highborn girl much prettier than me. You’ll hunt and hawk together, and she’ll give you her favor to wear in tournaments. Before long, you will have forgotten me entirely.”\n\n“I won’t!”\n\n“You will. You must.” Her voice was firm, but gentle.\n\n“The Lord of the Eyrie can do as he likes. Can’t I still love you, even if I have to marry her? Ser Harrold has a common woman. Benjicot says she’s carrying his bastard.”\n\nBenjicot should learn to keep his fool’s mouth shut. “Is that what you would have from me? A bastard?” She pulled her fingers from his grasp. “Would you dishonor me that way?”\n\nThe boy looked stricken. “No. I never meant — “\n\nAlayne stood. “If it please my lord, I must go and find my father. Someone needs to greet Lady Waynwood.” Before her little lord could find the words to protest, she gave him a quick curtsy and fled the bedchamber, sweeping down the hall and across a covered bridge to the Lord Protector’s apartments.\n\nWhen she had left Petyr Baelish that morning he had been breaking his fast with old Oswell who had arrived last night from Gulltown on a lathered horse. She hoped they might still be talking, but Petyr’s solar proved empty. Someone had left a window open and a stack of papers had blown onto the floor. The sun was slanting through the thick yellow windows, and dust motes danced in the light like tiny golden insects. Though snow had blanketed the heights of the Giant’s Lance above, below the mountain the autumn lingered and winter wheat was ripening in the fields.  Outside the window she could hear the laughter of the washerwomen at the well, the din of steel on steel from the ward where the knights were at their drills. Good sounds.\n\nAlayne loved it here. She felt alive again, for the first since her father… since Lord Eddard Stark had died.\n\nShe closed the window, gathered up the fallen papers, and stacked them on the table. One was a list of the competitors. Four-and-sixty knights had been invited to vie for places amongst Lord Robert Arryn’s  new Brotherhood of Winged Knights, and four­ and-sixty knights had come to tilt for the right to wear falcon’s wings upon their warhelms and guard their lord.\n\nThe competitors came from all over the Vale, from the mountain valleys and the coast, from Gulltown and the Bloody Gate, even the Three Sisters. Though a few were promised, only three were wed; the eight victors would be expected to spend the next three years at Lord Robert’s side, as his own personal guard (Alayne had suggested seven, like the Kingsguard, but Sweetrobin had insisted that he must have more knights than King Tommen), so older men with wives and children had not been invited.\n\nAnd they came, Alayne thought proudly. They all came.\n\nIt had fallen out just as Petyr said it would, the day the ravens flew. “They’re young, eager, hungry for adventure and renown. Lysa would not let them go to war. This is the next best thing. A chance to serve their lord and prove their prowess. They will come. Even Harry the Heir.” He had smoothed her hair and kissed her forehead. “What a clever daughter you are.”\n\nIt was clever. The tourney, the prizes, the winged knights, it had all been her own notion. Lord Robert’s mother had filled him full of fears, but he always took courage from the tales she read him of Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight of legend, founder of his line. Why not surround him with Winged Knights?  She had thought one night, after Sweetrobin had finally drifted off to sleep. His own Kingsguard, to keep him safe and make him brave. And no sooner did she tell Petyr her idea than he went out and made it happen. He will want to be there to greet Ser Harrold. Where could he have gone?\n\nAlayne swept down the tower stairs to enter the pillared gallery at the back of the Great Hall. Below her, serving men were setting up trestle tables for the evening feast, while their wives and daughters swept up the old rushes and scattered fresh ones. Lord Nestor was showing Lady Waxley his prize tapestries, with their scenes of hunt and chase. The same panels had once hung in the Red Keep of King’s Landing, when Robert sat the Iron Throne. Joffrey had them taken down and they had languished in some cellar until Petyr Baelish arranged for them to be brought to the Vale as a gift for Nestor Royce. Not only were the hangings beautiful, but the High Steward delighted in telling anyone who’d listen that they had once belonged to a king.\n\nPetyr was not in the Great Hall. Alayne crossed the gallery and descended the stair built into the thick west wall, to come out in the inner ward, where the jousting would be held. Viewing stands had raised for all those who had come to watch, with four long tilting barriers in between. Lord Nestor’s men were painting the barriers with whitewash, draping the stands with bright banners, and hanging shields on the gate the competitors would pass through when they made their entrance.\n\nAt the north end of the yard, three quintains had been set up, and some of the competitors were riding at them. Alayne knew them by their shields; the bells of Belmore, green vipers for the Lynderlys, the red sledge of Breakstone, House Tollett’s black and grey pily. Ser Mychel Redfort set one quintain spinning with a perfectly placed blow. He was one of those favored to win wings.\n\nPetyr was not at the quintains, nor anywhere in the yard, but as she turned to go a woman’s voice called out. “Alayne!” cried Myranda Royce, from a carved stone bench beneath a beech tree, where she was seated between two men. She looked in need of rescue. Smiling, Alayne walked toward her friend.\n\nMyranda was wearing a grey woolen dress, a green hooded cloak, and a rather desperate look. On either side of her sat a knight. The one on her right had a grizzled beard, a bald head, and a belly that spilled over his swordbelt where his lap should have been. The one on her left was no more than eighteen, and skinny as a spear. His ginger-colored whiskers only partially served to disguise the angry red pimples that dotted his face.\n\nThe bald knight wore a dark blue surcoat emblazoned with a huge pair of pink lips. The pimply-gingerlad countered with nine white seagulls on a field of brown, which marked him for a Shett of Gulltown. He was staring so intently at Myranda’s breasts that he hardly noticed Alayne until Myranda rose to hug her. “Thank you, thank you, thank you ” Randa whispered in her ear, before she turned to say, “Sers, may I present you the Lady Alayne Stone?”\n\n“The Lord Protector’s daughter,” the bald knight announced, all hearty gallantry. He rose ponderously. “And full as lovely as the tales told of her, I see.”\n\nNot to be outdone, the pimply knight hopped up and said,  “Ser Ossifer speaks truly, you are the most beautiful maid in all the Seven Kingdoms.” It might have been a sweeter courtesy had he not addressed it to her chest.\n\n“And have you seen all those maids yourself, ser?” Alayne asked him. “You are young to be so widely travelled.”\n\nHe blushed, which only made his pimples look angrier.  “No, my lady.   I am from Gulltown.”\n\nAnd I am not, though Alayne was born there. She would need to be careful around this one. “I remember Gulltown fondly,” she told him, with a smile as vague as it was pleasant. To Myranda she said, “Do you know where my father’s gotten to, perchance?”\n\n“Let me take you to him, my lady.”\n\n“I do hope you will forgive me for depriving you of Lady Myranda’s company,” Alayne told the knights. She did not wait for a reply, but took the older girl arm-in-arm and drew her away from the bench. Only when they were out of earshot did she whisper,  “Do you really know where my father is?”\n\n“Of course not. Walk faster, my new suitors may be following.” Myranda made a face. “Ossifer Lipps is the dullest knight in the Vale, but Uther Shett aspires to his laurels. I am praying they fight a duel for my hand, and kill each other.”\n\nAlayne giggled. “Surely Lord Nestor would not seriously entertain a suit from such men.”\n\n“Oh, he might. My lord father is annoyed with me for killing my last husband and putting him to all this trouble.”\n\n“It was not your fault he died.”\n\n“There was no one else in the bed that I recall.”\n\nAlayne could not help but shutter. Myranda’s husband had died when he was making love with her. “Those Sistermen who came in yesterday were gallant,” she said, to change the subject. “If you don’t like Ser Ossifer or Ser Uther, marry one of them instead. I thought the youngest one was very handsome.”\n\n“The one in the sealskin cloak?” Randa said, incredulous.\n\n“One of his brothers, then.”\n\nMyranda rolled her eyes. “They’re from the Sisters. Did you ever know a Sisterman who could joust? They clean their swords with codfish oil and wash in tubs of cold seawater.”\n\n“Well,” Alayne said, “at least they’re clean.”\n\n“Some of them have webs between their toes. I’d sooner marry Lord Petyr. Then I’d be your mother. How little is his finger, I ask you?”\n\nAlayne did not dignify that question with an answer. “Lady Waynwood will be here soon, with her sons.”\n\n“Is that a promise or a threat?” Myranda said. “The first Lady Waynwood must have been a mare, I think. How else to explain why all the Waynwood men are horse-faced? If I were ever to wed a Waynwood, he would have to swear a vow to don his helm whenever he wished to fuck me, and keep the visor closed.” She gave Alayne a pinch on the arm. “My Harry will be with them, though. I notice that you left him out. I shall never forgive you for stealing him away from me. He’s the boy I want to marry.”\n\n“The betrothal was my father’s doing,”  Alayne protested, as she had a hundred times before.  She is only teasing, she told herself… but behind the japes, she could hear the hurt.\n\nMyranda stopped to gaze across the yard at the knights at their practice. “Now there’s the very sort of husband I need.”\n\nA few feet away, two knights were fighting with blunted practice swords. Their blades crashed together twice, then slipped past each other only to be blocked by upraised shields, but the bigger man gave ground at the impact. Alayne could not see the front of his shield from where she stood, but his attacker bore three ravens in flight, each clutching a red heart in its claws. Three hearts and three ravens.\n\nShe knew right then how the fight would end.\n\nA few moments later and the big man sprawled dazed in the dust with his helm askew. When his squire undid the fastenings to bare his head, there was blood trickling down his scalp. If the swords had not been blunted, there would be brains as well. That last head blow had been so hard Alayne had winced in sympathy when it fell. Myranda Royce considered the victor thoughtfully.  “Do you think if I asked nicely Ser Lyn would kill my suitors for me?”\n\n“He might, for a plump bag of gold.” Ser Lyn Corbray was forever desperately short of coin, all the Vale knew that.\n\n“Alas, all I have is a plump pair of teats. Though with Ser Lyn, a plump sausage under my skirts would serve me better.”\n\nAlayne’s giggle drew Corbray’s attention. He handed his shield to his loutish squire, removed his helm and quilted coif.  “Ladies.” His long brown hair was plastered to his brow by sweat.\n\n“Well struck, Ser Lyn,” Alayne called out. “Though I fear you’ve knocked poor Ser Owen insensible.”\n\nCorbray glanced back to where his foe was being helped from the yard by his squire. “He had no sense to start with, or he should not have tried me.”\n\nThere is truth in that, Alayne thought, but some demon of mischief was in her that morning, so she gave Ser Lyn a thrust of her own. Smiling sweetly, she said, “My lord father tells me your brother’s new wife is with child.”\n\nCorbray gave her a dark look. “Lyonel sends his regrets. He remains at Heart’s Home with his peddler’s daughter, watching her belly swell as if he were the first man who ever got a wench pregnant.”\n\nOh, that’s an open wound, thought Alayne. Lyonel Corbray’s first wife had given him nothing but a frail, sickly babe who died in infancy, and during all those years Ser Lyn had remained his brother’s heir. When the poor woman finally died, however, Petyr Baelish had stepped in and brokered a new marriage for Lord Corbray. The second Lady Corbray was sixteen, the daughter of a wealthy Gulltown merchant, but she had come with an immense dowry, and men said she was a tall, strapping, healthy girl, with big breasts and good, wide hips. And fertile too, it seems.\n\n“We are all praying that the Mother grants Lady Corbray an easy labor and a healthy child,” said Myranda.\n\nAlayne could not help herself. She smiled and said, “My father is always pleased to be of service to one of Lord Robert’s leal bannermen. I’m sure he would be most delighted to help broker a marriage for you as well, Ser Lyn.”\n\n“How kind of him.” Corbray’s lips drew back in something that might have been meant as a smile, though it gave Alayne a chill. “But what need have I for heirs when I am landless and like to remain so, thanks to our Lord Protector?  No.  Tell your lord father I need none of his brood mares.”\n\nThe venom in his voice was so thick that for a moment she almost forgot that Lyn Corbray was actually her father’s catspaw, bought and paid for. Or was he?  Perhaps, instead of being Petyr’s man pretending to be Petyr’s foe, he was actually his foe pretending to be his man pretending to be his foe.\n\nJust thinking about it was enough to make her head spin. Alayne turned abruptly from the yard… and bumped into a short, sharp-faced man with a brush of orange hair who had come up behind her.  His hand shot out and caught her arm before she could fall.   “My lady.  My pardons if I took you unawares.”\n\n“The fault was mine. I did not see you standing there.”\n\n“We mice are quiet creatures.” Ser Shadrich was so short that he might have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much older man. She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of his mouth, old battles in the scar beneath his ear, and a hardness behind the eyes that no boy would ever have. This was a man grown. Even Randa overtopped him, though.\n\n“Will you be seeking wings?” the Royce girl said.\n\n“A mouse with wings would be a silly sight.”\n\n“Perhaps you will try the melee instead?” Alayne suggested.  The melee was an afterthought, a sop for all the brothers, uncles, fathers, and friends who had accompanied the competitors to the Gates of the Moon to see them win their silver wings, but there would be prizes for the champions, and a chance to win ransoms.\n\n“A good melee is all a hedge knight can hope for, unless he stumbles on a bag of dragons. And that’s not likely, is it?”\n\n“I suppose not. But now you must excuse us, ser, we need to find my lord father. “\n\nHorns sounded from atop the wall.  “Too late,” Myranda said. “They’re here.  We shall need to do the honors by ourselves.”  She grinned.   “Last one to the gate must marry Uther Shett.”\n\nThey made a race of it, dashing headlong across the yard and past the stables, skirts flapping, whilst knights and serving men alike looked on, and pigs and chickens scattered before them. It was most unladylike, but Alayne sound found herself laughing. For just a little while, as she ran, she forget who she was, and where, and found herself remembering bright cold days at Winterfell, when she would race through Winterfell with her friend Jeyne Poole, with Arya running after them trying to keep up.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the gatehouse, both of them were red-faced and panting. Myranda had lost her cloak somewhere along the way. They were just in time. The portcullis had been raised, and a column of riders twenty strong were passing underneath. At their head rode Anya Waynwood, Lady of Ironoaks, stern and slim, her grey-brown hair bound up in a scarf. Her riding cloak was heavy green wool trimmed with brown fur, and clasped at the throat by a niello brooch in the shape of the broken wheel of her House.\n\nMyranda Royce stepped forward and sketched a curtsy. “Lady Anya. Welcome to the Gates of the Moon.”\n\n“Lady Myranda. Lady Alayne.” Anya Waynwood inclined her head to each of them in turn. “It is good of you to greet us. Allow me to present my grandson, Ser Roland Waynwood.”  She nodded at the knight who had spoken.  “And this is my youngest son, Ser Wallace Waynwood.  And of course my ward, Ser Harrold Hardyng.”\n\nHarry the Heir, Alayne thought. My husband-to-be, if he will have me.  A sudden terror filled her.  She wondered if her face was red. Don’t stare at him, she reminded herself, don’t stare, don’t gape, don’t gawk.  Look away. Her hair must be a frightful mess after all that running.  It took all her will to stop herself from trying to tuck the loose strands back into place. Never mind your stupid hair.  Your hair doesn’t matter.  It’s him that matters.  Him, and the Waynwoods.\n\nSer Roland was the oldest of the three, though no more than five-and-twenty. He was taller and more muscular than Ser Wallace, but both were long-faced and lantern-jawed, with stringy brown hair and pinched noses.  Horsefaced and homely, Alayne thought.\n\nHarry, though…\n\nMy Harry.  My lord, my lover, my betrothed.\n\nSer Harrold Hardyng looked every inch a lord-in-waiting; clean-limbed and handsome, straight as a lance, hard with muscle. Men old enough to have known Jon Arryn in his youth said Ser Harrold had his look, she knew. He had a mop of sandy blond hair, pale blue eyes, an aquiline nose. Joffrey was comely too, though, she reminded herself.   A comely monster, that’s what he was.  Little Lord Tyrion was kinder, twisted though he was.\n\nHarry was staring at her. He knows who I am, she realized, and he does not seem pleased to see me. It was only then that she took note of his heraldry. Though his surcoat and horse trappings were patterned in the red-and-white diamonds of House Hardyng, his shield was quartered. The arms of Hardyng and Waynwood were displayed in the first and third quarters, respectively, but in the second and fourth quarters he bore the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky blue and cream. Sweetrobin will not like that.\n\nSer Wallace said, “Are we the l-l-last?”\n\n“You are, sers,” replied Myranda Royce, taking absolutely no notice of his stammer.\n\n“Wh-wh-when will the t-t-tilts commence?”\n\n“Oh, soon, I pray,” said Randa. “Some of the competitors have been here for almost a moon’s turn, partaking of my father’s meat and mead. All good fellows, and very brave… but they do eat rather a lot.”\n\nThe Waynwoods laughed, and even Harry the Heir cracked a thin smile. “It was snowing in the passes, else we would have been here sooner,” said Lady Anya.\n\n“Had we known such beauty awaited us at the Gates, we would have flown,” Ser Roland said.  Though his words were addressed to Myranda Royce, he smiled at Alayne as he said them.\n\n“To fly you would need wings,” Randa replied, “and there are some knights here who might have a thing to say concerning that.”\n\n“I look forward to a spirited discussion.” Ser Roland swung down from his horse, turned to Alayne, and smiled.  “I had heard that Lord Littlefinger’s daughter was fair of face and full of grace, but no one ever told me that she was a thief.”\n\n“You wrong me, ser. I am no thief!”\n\nSer Roland placed his hand over his heart. “Then how do you explain this hole in my chest, from where you stole my heart?”\n\n“He is only t-teasing you, my lady,” stammered Ser Wallace. “My n-n-nephew never had a h-h-heart.”\n\n“The Waynwood wheel has a broken spoke, and we have my nuncle here.” Ser Roland gave Wallace a whap behind the ear.  “Squires should be quiet when knights are speaking.”\n\nSer Wallace reddened.  “I am no more a s-squire, my lady.  My n-nephew knows full well that I was k-k-kni-k-k-kni –“\n\n“Dubbed?” Alayne suggested gently.\n\n“Dubbed,” said Wallace Waynwood, gratefully.\n\nRobb would be his age, if he were still alive, she could not help but think, but Robb died a king, and this is just a boy.\n\n“My lord father has assigned you rooms in the East Tower,” Lady Myranda was telling Lady Waynwood, “but I fear your knights will need to share a bed. The Gates of the Moon were never meant to house so many noble visitors.”\n\n“You are in the Falcon Tower, Ser Harrold,” Alayne put in. Far away from Sweetrobin. That was intentional, she knew. Petyr Baelish did not leave such things to chance. “If it please you, I will show you to your chambers myself.” This time her eyes met Harry’s.  She smiled just for him, and said a silent prayer to the Maiden. Please, he doesn’t need to love me, just make him like me, just a little, that would be enough for now.\n\nSer Harrold looked down at her coldly. “Why should it please me to be escorted anywhere by Littlefinger’s bastard?”\n\nAll three Waynwoods looked at him askance. “You are a guest here, Harry,” Lady Anya reminded him, in a frosty voice. “See that you remember that.”\n\nA lady’s armor is her courtesy. Alayne could feel the blood rushing to her face. No tears, she prayed. Please, please, I must not cry. “As you wish, ser. And now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger’s bastard must find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can begin the tourney on the morrow.”  And may your horse stumble, Harry the Heir, so you fall on your stupid head in your first tilt. She showed the Waynwoods a stone face as they blurted out awkward apologies for their companion. When they were done she turned and fled.\n\nNear the keep, she ran headlong into Ser Lothor Brune and almost knocked him off his feet. “Harry the Heir?  Harry the Arse, I say. He’s just some upjumped squire.”\n\nAlayne was so grateful that she hugged him. “Thank you. Have you seen my father, ser?”\n\n“Down in the vaults, ” Ser Lothar said, “inspecting Lord Nestor’s granaries with Lord Grafton and Lord Belmore.”\n\nThe vaults were large and dark and filthy. Alayne lit a taper and clutched her skirt as she made the descent. Near the bottom, she heard Lord Grafton’s booming voice, and followed.”The merchants are clamoring to buy, and the lords are clamoring to sell,” the Gulltowner was saying when she found them.  Though not a tall man, Grafton was wide, with thick arms and shoulders.  His hair was a dirty blond mop.  “How am I to stop that, my lord?”\n\n“Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does not matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale. “\n\n“These prices, though,”  protested fat Lord Belmore,”  these prices are more than fair.”\n\n“You say more than fair, my lord.  I say less than we would wish.  Wait.  If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored.  Winter is coming.  Prices must go higher.”\n\n“Perhaps,”  said Belmore, doubtfully.\n\n“Bronze Yohn will not wait, ”  Grafton complained.  “He need not ship through Gulltown, he has his own ports.  Whilst we are hoarding our harvest, Royce and the other Lords Declarant will turn theirs into silver, you may be sure of that.”\n\n“Let us hope so,”  said Petyr.  “When their granaries are empty, they will need every scrap of that silver to buy sustenance from us.  And now if you will excuse me, my lord, it would seem my daughter has need of me.”\n\n“Lady Alayne,” Lord Grafton said. “You look bright-eyed this morning.”\n\n“You are kind to say so, my lord. Father, I am sorry to disturb you, but I thought you would want to know that the Waynwoods have arrived.”\n\n“And is Ser Harrold with them?”\n\nHorrible Ser Harrold.  “ He is.”\n\nLord Belmore laughed. “I never thought Royce would let him come. Is he blind, or merely stupid?”\n\n“He is honorable.  Sometimes it amounts to the same thing.  If he denied the lad the chance to prove himself, it could create a rift between them, so why not let him tilt?  The boy is nowise skilled enough to win a place amongst the Winged Knights.”\n\n“I suppose not,” said Belmore, grudgingly.  Lord Grafton kissed Alayne on the hand, and the two lords went off, leaving her alone with her lord father.\n\n“Come,” Petyr said, “walk with me.”  He took her by the arm and led her deeper into the vaults, past an empty dungeon.  “And how was your first meeting with Harry the Heir?”\n\n“He’s horrible.”\n\n“The world is full of horrors, sweet.  By now you ought to know that.  You’ve seen enough of them.”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “but why must he be so cruel?  He called me your bastard.  Right in the yard, in front of everyone.”\n\n“So far as he knows, that’s who you are.  This betrothal was never his idea, and Bronze Yohn has no doubt warned him against my wiles.  You are my daughter.  He does not trust you, and he believes that you’re beneath him.”\n\n“Well, I’m not.  He may think he’s some great knight, but Ser Lothor says he’s just some upjumped squire.”\n\nPetyr put his arm around her.  “So he is, but he is Robert’s heir as well.  Bringing Harry here was the first step in our plan, but now we need to keep him, and only you can do that.  He has a weakness for a pretty face, and whose face is prettier than yours?  Charm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.”\n\n“I don’t know how,”  she said miserably.\n\n“Oh, I think you do,” said Littlefinger, with one of those smiles that did not reach his eyes.  “You will be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight, as lovely as your lady mother at your age.  I cannot seat you on the dais, but you’ll have a place of honor above the salt and underneath a wall sconce.  The fire will be shining in your hair, so everyone will see how fair of face you are.  Keep a good long spoon on hand to beat the squires off, sweetling.  You will not want green boys underfoot when the knights come round to beg you for your favor.”\n\n“Who would ask to wear a bastard’s favor?”\n\n“Harry, if he has the wits the gods gave a goose… but do not give it to him.  Choose some other gallant, and favor him instead.  You do not want to seem too eager.”\n\n“No,” Alayne said.\n\n“Lady Waynwood will insist that Harry dance with you, I can promise you that much.  That will be your chance. Smile at the boy.  Touch him when you speak.  Tease him, to pique his pride.  If he seems to be responding, tell him that you are feeling faint, and ask him to take you outside for a breath of fresh air.  No knight could refuse such a request from a fair maiden.”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “but he thinks that I’m a bastard.”\n\n“A beautiful bastard, and the Lord Protector’s daughter.”  Petyr drew her close and kissed her on both cheeks.  “The night belongs to you, sweetling, Remember that, always.”\n\n“I’ll try, father,” she said.\n\nThe feast proved to be everything her father promised.\n\nSixty-four dishes were served, in honor of the sixty-four competitors who had come so far to contest for silver wings before their lord. From the rivers and the lakes came pike and trout and salmon, from the seas crabs and cod and herring. Ducks there were, and capons, peacocks in their plumage and swans in almond milk. Suckling pigs were served up crackling with apples in their mouths, and three huge aurochs were roasted whole above firepits in the castle yard, since they were too big to get through the kitchen doors. Loaves of hot bread filled the trestle tables in Lord Nestor’s hall, and massive wheels of cheese were brought up from the vaults.  The butter was fresh-churned, and there were leeks and carrots, roasted onions, beets, turnips, parsnips.  And best of all, Lord Nestor’s cooks prepared a splendid subtlety, a lemon cake in the shape of the Giant’s Lance, twelve feet tall and adorned with an Eyrie made of sugar.\n\nFor me, Alayne thought, as they wheeled it out.  Sweetrobin loved lemon cakes too, but only after she told him that they were her favorites.  The cake had required every lemon in the Vale, but Petyr had promised that he would send to Dorne for more.\n\nThere were gifts as well, splendid gifts.  Each of the competitors received a cloak of cloth-of-silver and a lapis brooch in the shape of a pair of falcon’s wings.  Fine steel daggers were given to the brothers, fathers, and friends who had come to watch them tilt.  For their mothers, sisters, and ladies fair there were bolts of silk and Myrish lace.\n\n“Lord Nestor has an open hand,” Alayne heard Ser Edmund Breakstone say.  “An open hand and a little finger,” Lady Waynwood replied, with a nod toward Petyr Baelish.   Breakstone was not slow to take her meaning.  The true source of this largesse was not Lord Nestor, but the Lord Protector.\n\nWhen the last course had been served and cleared, the tables were lifted from their trestles to clear the floor for dancing, and musicians were brought in.\n\n“Are there no singers?” asked Ben Coldwater.\n\n“The little lord cannot abide them,” Ser Lymond Lynderly replied.  “Not since Marillion.”\n\n“Ah… that was the man who murdered Lady Lysa, yes?”\n\nAlayne spoke up. “His singing pleased her greatly, and she showed him too much favor, perhaps.  When she wed my father he went mad and pushed her out the Moon Door.  Lord Robert has hated singing ever since.  He is still fond of music, though.”\n\n“As am I,” Coldwater said.  Rising, he offered Alayne his hand.  “Would you honor me with this dance, my lady?”\n\n“You’re very kind,” she said, as he led her to the floor.\n\nHe was her first partner of the evening, but far from the last.  Just as Petyr had promised, the young knights flocked around her, vying for her favor.  After Ben came Andrew Tollett, handsome Ser Byron, red-nosed Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse.  Then Ser Albar Royce, Myranda’s stout dull brother and Lord Nestor’s heir.  She danced with all three Sunderlands, none of whom had webs between their fingers, though she could not vouch for their toes.  Uther Shett appeared to pay her slimy compliments as he trod upon her feet, but Ser Targon the Halfwild proved to be the soul of courtesy.  After that Ser Roland Waynwood swept her up and made her laugh with mocking comments about half the other knights in the hall.  His uncle Wallace took a turn as well and tried to do the same, but the words would not come.  Alayne finally took pity on him and began to chatter happily, to spare him the embarrassment.  When the dance was done she excused herself, and went back to her place to have a drink of wine.\n\nAnd there he stood, Harry the Heir himself; tall, handsome, scowling.  “Lady Alayne. May I partner you in this dance?”\n\nShe considered for a moment. “No. I don’t think so.”\n\nColor rose to his cheeks.  “I was unforgiveably rude to you in the yard.  You must forgive me.”\n\n“Must?” She tossed her hair, took a sip of wine, made him wait.  “How can you forgive someone who is unforgiveably rude?  Will you explain that to me, ser?”\n\nSer Harrold looked confused. “Please.  One dance.”\n\nCharm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.  “If you insist.”\n\nHe nodded, offered his arm, led her out onto the floor.  As they waited for the music to resume, Alayne glanced at the dais, where Lord Robert sat staring at them.  Please, she prayed, don’t let him start to twitch and shake.  Not here.  Not now.  Maester Coleman would have made certain that he drank a strong dose of sweetmilk before the feast, but even so.\n\nThen the musicians took up a tune, and she was dancing.\n\nSay something, she urged herself.  You will never make Ser Harry love you if you don’t have the courage to talk him.  Should she tell him what a good dancer he was?  No, he’s probably heard that a dozen times tonight.  Besides, Petyr said that I should not seem eager.  Instead she said, “I have heard that you are about to be a father.”  It was not something most girls would say to their almost-betrothed, but she wanted to see if Ser Harrold would lie.\n\n“For the second time. My daughter Alys is two years old.”\n\nYour bastard daughter Alys, Alayne thought, but what she said was, “That one had a different mother, though.”\n\n“Yes. Cissy was a pretty thing when I tumbled her, but childbirth left her as fat as a cow, so Lady Anya arranged for her to marry one of her men-at-arms.  It is different with Saffron.”\n\n“Saffron?”  Alayne tried not to laugh.  “Truly?”\n\nSer Harrold had the grace to blush.  “Her father says she is more precious to him than gold.  He’s rich, the richest man in Gulltown.  A fortune in spices.”\n\n“What will you name the babe?” she asked.  “Cinnamon if she’s a girl?  Cloves if he’s a boy?”\n\nThat almost made him stumble.  “My lady japes.”\n\n“Oh, no.”  Petyr will howl when I tell him what I said.\n\n“Saffron is very beautiful, I’ll have you know.  Tall and slim, with big brown eyes and hair like honey.”\n\nAlayne raised her head.  “More beautiful than me?”\n\nSer Harrold studied her face. “You are comely enough, I grant you.  When Lady Anya first told me of this match, I was afraid that you might look like your father.”\n\n“Little pointy beard and all?”  Alayne laughed.\n\n“I never meant… “\n\n“I hope you joust better than you talk.”\n\nFor a moment he looked shocked.  But as the song was ending, he burst into a laugh.  “No one told me you were clever.”\n\nHe has good teeth, she thought, straight and white.  And when he smiles, he has the nicest dimples.  She ran one finger down his cheek.  “Should we ever wed, you’ll have to send Saffron back to her father.  I’ll be all the spice you’ll want.”\n\nHe grinned.  “I will hold you to that promise, my lady.  Until that day, may I wear your favor in the tourney?”\n\n“You may not.  It is promised to… another.”  She was not sure who as yet, but she knew she would find someone.\n","source":"_posts/ALAYNE.md","raw":"---\ntitle: ALAYNE\ndate: 2016-04-06 20:59:24\ntags: 冰与火之歌\ncomments: false\n---\n## ALAYNE\\--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\n\nShe was reading her little lord a tale of the Winged Knight when Mya Stone came knocking on the door of his bedchamber, clad in boots and riding leathers and smelling strongly of the stable. Mya had straw in her hair and a scowl on her face. That scowl comes of having Mychel Redfort near, Alayne knew.\n\n“Your lordship,” Mya informed Lord Robert, “Lady Waynwood’s banners have been seen an hour down the road. She will be here soon, with your cousin Harry. Will you want to greet them?”\n\nWhy did she have to mention Harry? Alayne thought. We will never get Sweetrobin out of bed now. The boy slapped a pillow. “Send them away. I never asked them here.”\n<!-- more -->\nMya looked nonplussed. No one in the Vale was better at handling a mule, but lordlings were another matter. “They were invited,” she said uncertainly, “for the tourney. I don’t… “\n\nAlayne closed her book.  “Thank you, Mya. Let me talk with Lord Robert, if you would.”\n\nRelief plain on her face, Mya fled without another word.\n\n“I hate that Harry,” Sweetrobin said when she was gone. “He calls me cousin, but he’s just waiting for me to die so he can take the Eyrie. He thinks I don’t know, but I do.”\n\n“Your lordship should not believe such nonsense,” Alayne said. “I’m sure Ser Harrold loves you well.” And if the gods are good, he will love me too. Her tummy gave a little flutter.\n\n“He doesn’t,” Lord Robert insisted. “He wants my father’s castle, that’s all, so he pretends.” The boy clutched the blanket to his pimply chest. “I don’t want you to marry him, Alayne. I am the Lord of the Eyrie, and I forbid it.” He sounded as if he were about to cry. “You should marry me instead. We could sleep in the same bed every night, and you could read me stories.”\n\nNo man can wed me so long as my dwarf husband still lives somewhere in this world. Queen Cersei had collected the head of a dozen dwarfs, Petyr claimed, but none were Tyrion’s. “Sweetrobin, you must not say such things. You are the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, and you must wed a highborn lady and father a son to sit in the High Hall of House Arryn after you are gone.”\n\nRobert wiped his nose. “But I want — “\n\nShe put a finger to his lips. “I know what you want, but it cannot be. I am no fit wife for you. I am bastard born.”\n\n“I don’t care. I love you best of anyone. “\n\nYou are such a little fool.  “Your lords bannermen will care. Some call my father upjumped and ambitious. If you were to take me to wife, they would say that he made you do it, that it was no will of yours. The Lords Declarant might take arms against him once again, and he and I should both be put to death.”\n\n“I wouldn’t let them hurt you!” Lord Robert said. “If they try I will make them all fly.” His hand began to tremble.\n\nAlayne stroked his fingers. “There, my Sweetrobin, be still now.” When the shaking passed, she said, “You must have a proper wife, a trueborn maid of noble birth.”\n\n“No. I want to marry you, Alayne.”\n\nOnce your lady mother intended that very thing, but I was trueborn then, and noble. “My lord is kind to say so.” Alayne smoothed his hair. Lady Lysa had never let the servants touch it, and after she had died Robert had suffered terrible shaking fits whenever anyone came near him with a blade, so it had been allowed to grow until it tumbled over his round shoulders and halfway down his flabby white chest. He does have pretty hair.  If the gods are good and he lives long enough to wed, his wife will admire his hair, surely.  That much she will love about him. “Any child of ours would be baseborn. Only a trueborn child of House Arryn can displace Ser Harrold as your heir. My father will find a proper wife for you, some highborn girl much prettier than me. You’ll hunt and hawk together, and she’ll give you her favor to wear in tournaments. Before long, you will have forgotten me entirely.”\n\n“I won’t!”\n\n“You will. You must.” Her voice was firm, but gentle.\n\n“The Lord of the Eyrie can do as he likes. Can’t I still love you, even if I have to marry her? Ser Harrold has a common woman. Benjicot says she’s carrying his bastard.”\n\nBenjicot should learn to keep his fool’s mouth shut. “Is that what you would have from me? A bastard?” She pulled her fingers from his grasp. “Would you dishonor me that way?”\n\nThe boy looked stricken. “No. I never meant — “\n\nAlayne stood. “If it please my lord, I must go and find my father. Someone needs to greet Lady Waynwood.” Before her little lord could find the words to protest, she gave him a quick curtsy and fled the bedchamber, sweeping down the hall and across a covered bridge to the Lord Protector’s apartments.\n\nWhen she had left Petyr Baelish that morning he had been breaking his fast with old Oswell who had arrived last night from Gulltown on a lathered horse. She hoped they might still be talking, but Petyr’s solar proved empty. Someone had left a window open and a stack of papers had blown onto the floor. The sun was slanting through the thick yellow windows, and dust motes danced in the light like tiny golden insects. Though snow had blanketed the heights of the Giant’s Lance above, below the mountain the autumn lingered and winter wheat was ripening in the fields.  Outside the window she could hear the laughter of the washerwomen at the well, the din of steel on steel from the ward where the knights were at their drills. Good sounds.\n\nAlayne loved it here. She felt alive again, for the first since her father… since Lord Eddard Stark had died.\n\nShe closed the window, gathered up the fallen papers, and stacked them on the table. One was a list of the competitors. Four-and-sixty knights had been invited to vie for places amongst Lord Robert Arryn’s  new Brotherhood of Winged Knights, and four­ and-sixty knights had come to tilt for the right to wear falcon’s wings upon their warhelms and guard their lord.\n\nThe competitors came from all over the Vale, from the mountain valleys and the coast, from Gulltown and the Bloody Gate, even the Three Sisters. Though a few were promised, only three were wed; the eight victors would be expected to spend the next three years at Lord Robert’s side, as his own personal guard (Alayne had suggested seven, like the Kingsguard, but Sweetrobin had insisted that he must have more knights than King Tommen), so older men with wives and children had not been invited.\n\nAnd they came, Alayne thought proudly. They all came.\n\nIt had fallen out just as Petyr said it would, the day the ravens flew. “They’re young, eager, hungry for adventure and renown. Lysa would not let them go to war. This is the next best thing. A chance to serve their lord and prove their prowess. They will come. Even Harry the Heir.” He had smoothed her hair and kissed her forehead. “What a clever daughter you are.”\n\nIt was clever. The tourney, the prizes, the winged knights, it had all been her own notion. Lord Robert’s mother had filled him full of fears, but he always took courage from the tales she read him of Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight of legend, founder of his line. Why not surround him with Winged Knights?  She had thought one night, after Sweetrobin had finally drifted off to sleep. His own Kingsguard, to keep him safe and make him brave. And no sooner did she tell Petyr her idea than he went out and made it happen. He will want to be there to greet Ser Harrold. Where could he have gone?\n\nAlayne swept down the tower stairs to enter the pillared gallery at the back of the Great Hall. Below her, serving men were setting up trestle tables for the evening feast, while their wives and daughters swept up the old rushes and scattered fresh ones. Lord Nestor was showing Lady Waxley his prize tapestries, with their scenes of hunt and chase. The same panels had once hung in the Red Keep of King’s Landing, when Robert sat the Iron Throne. Joffrey had them taken down and they had languished in some cellar until Petyr Baelish arranged for them to be brought to the Vale as a gift for Nestor Royce. Not only were the hangings beautiful, but the High Steward delighted in telling anyone who’d listen that they had once belonged to a king.\n\nPetyr was not in the Great Hall. Alayne crossed the gallery and descended the stair built into the thick west wall, to come out in the inner ward, where the jousting would be held. Viewing stands had raised for all those who had come to watch, with four long tilting barriers in between. Lord Nestor’s men were painting the barriers with whitewash, draping the stands with bright banners, and hanging shields on the gate the competitors would pass through when they made their entrance.\n\nAt the north end of the yard, three quintains had been set up, and some of the competitors were riding at them. Alayne knew them by their shields; the bells of Belmore, green vipers for the Lynderlys, the red sledge of Breakstone, House Tollett’s black and grey pily. Ser Mychel Redfort set one quintain spinning with a perfectly placed blow. He was one of those favored to win wings.\n\nPetyr was not at the quintains, nor anywhere in the yard, but as she turned to go a woman’s voice called out. “Alayne!” cried Myranda Royce, from a carved stone bench beneath a beech tree, where she was seated between two men. She looked in need of rescue. Smiling, Alayne walked toward her friend.\n\nMyranda was wearing a grey woolen dress, a green hooded cloak, and a rather desperate look. On either side of her sat a knight. The one on her right had a grizzled beard, a bald head, and a belly that spilled over his swordbelt where his lap should have been. The one on her left was no more than eighteen, and skinny as a spear. His ginger-colored whiskers only partially served to disguise the angry red pimples that dotted his face.\n\nThe bald knight wore a dark blue surcoat emblazoned with a huge pair of pink lips. The pimply-gingerlad countered with nine white seagulls on a field of brown, which marked him for a Shett of Gulltown. He was staring so intently at Myranda’s breasts that he hardly noticed Alayne until Myranda rose to hug her. “Thank you, thank you, thank you ” Randa whispered in her ear, before she turned to say, “Sers, may I present you the Lady Alayne Stone?”\n\n“The Lord Protector’s daughter,” the bald knight announced, all hearty gallantry. He rose ponderously. “And full as lovely as the tales told of her, I see.”\n\nNot to be outdone, the pimply knight hopped up and said,  “Ser Ossifer speaks truly, you are the most beautiful maid in all the Seven Kingdoms.” It might have been a sweeter courtesy had he not addressed it to her chest.\n\n“And have you seen all those maids yourself, ser?” Alayne asked him. “You are young to be so widely travelled.”\n\nHe blushed, which only made his pimples look angrier.  “No, my lady.   I am from Gulltown.”\n\nAnd I am not, though Alayne was born there. She would need to be careful around this one. “I remember Gulltown fondly,” she told him, with a smile as vague as it was pleasant. To Myranda she said, “Do you know where my father’s gotten to, perchance?”\n\n“Let me take you to him, my lady.”\n\n“I do hope you will forgive me for depriving you of Lady Myranda’s company,” Alayne told the knights. She did not wait for a reply, but took the older girl arm-in-arm and drew her away from the bench. Only when they were out of earshot did she whisper,  “Do you really know where my father is?”\n\n“Of course not. Walk faster, my new suitors may be following.” Myranda made a face. “Ossifer Lipps is the dullest knight in the Vale, but Uther Shett aspires to his laurels. I am praying they fight a duel for my hand, and kill each other.”\n\nAlayne giggled. “Surely Lord Nestor would not seriously entertain a suit from such men.”\n\n“Oh, he might. My lord father is annoyed with me for killing my last husband and putting him to all this trouble.”\n\n“It was not your fault he died.”\n\n“There was no one else in the bed that I recall.”\n\nAlayne could not help but shutter. Myranda’s husband had died when he was making love with her. “Those Sistermen who came in yesterday were gallant,” she said, to change the subject. “If you don’t like Ser Ossifer or Ser Uther, marry one of them instead. I thought the youngest one was very handsome.”\n\n“The one in the sealskin cloak?” Randa said, incredulous.\n\n“One of his brothers, then.”\n\nMyranda rolled her eyes. “They’re from the Sisters. Did you ever know a Sisterman who could joust? They clean their swords with codfish oil and wash in tubs of cold seawater.”\n\n“Well,” Alayne said, “at least they’re clean.”\n\n“Some of them have webs between their toes. I’d sooner marry Lord Petyr. Then I’d be your mother. How little is his finger, I ask you?”\n\nAlayne did not dignify that question with an answer. “Lady Waynwood will be here soon, with her sons.”\n\n“Is that a promise or a threat?” Myranda said. “The first Lady Waynwood must have been a mare, I think. How else to explain why all the Waynwood men are horse-faced? If I were ever to wed a Waynwood, he would have to swear a vow to don his helm whenever he wished to fuck me, and keep the visor closed.” She gave Alayne a pinch on the arm. “My Harry will be with them, though. I notice that you left him out. I shall never forgive you for stealing him away from me. He’s the boy I want to marry.”\n\n“The betrothal was my father’s doing,”  Alayne protested, as she had a hundred times before.  She is only teasing, she told herself… but behind the japes, she could hear the hurt.\n\nMyranda stopped to gaze across the yard at the knights at their practice. “Now there’s the very sort of husband I need.”\n\nA few feet away, two knights were fighting with blunted practice swords. Their blades crashed together twice, then slipped past each other only to be blocked by upraised shields, but the bigger man gave ground at the impact. Alayne could not see the front of his shield from where she stood, but his attacker bore three ravens in flight, each clutching a red heart in its claws. Three hearts and three ravens.\n\nShe knew right then how the fight would end.\n\nA few moments later and the big man sprawled dazed in the dust with his helm askew. When his squire undid the fastenings to bare his head, there was blood trickling down his scalp. If the swords had not been blunted, there would be brains as well. That last head blow had been so hard Alayne had winced in sympathy when it fell. Myranda Royce considered the victor thoughtfully.  “Do you think if I asked nicely Ser Lyn would kill my suitors for me?”\n\n“He might, for a plump bag of gold.” Ser Lyn Corbray was forever desperately short of coin, all the Vale knew that.\n\n“Alas, all I have is a plump pair of teats. Though with Ser Lyn, a plump sausage under my skirts would serve me better.”\n\nAlayne’s giggle drew Corbray’s attention. He handed his shield to his loutish squire, removed his helm and quilted coif.  “Ladies.” His long brown hair was plastered to his brow by sweat.\n\n“Well struck, Ser Lyn,” Alayne called out. “Though I fear you’ve knocked poor Ser Owen insensible.”\n\nCorbray glanced back to where his foe was being helped from the yard by his squire. “He had no sense to start with, or he should not have tried me.”\n\nThere is truth in that, Alayne thought, but some demon of mischief was in her that morning, so she gave Ser Lyn a thrust of her own. Smiling sweetly, she said, “My lord father tells me your brother’s new wife is with child.”\n\nCorbray gave her a dark look. “Lyonel sends his regrets. He remains at Heart’s Home with his peddler’s daughter, watching her belly swell as if he were the first man who ever got a wench pregnant.”\n\nOh, that’s an open wound, thought Alayne. Lyonel Corbray’s first wife had given him nothing but a frail, sickly babe who died in infancy, and during all those years Ser Lyn had remained his brother’s heir. When the poor woman finally died, however, Petyr Baelish had stepped in and brokered a new marriage for Lord Corbray. The second Lady Corbray was sixteen, the daughter of a wealthy Gulltown merchant, but she had come with an immense dowry, and men said she was a tall, strapping, healthy girl, with big breasts and good, wide hips. And fertile too, it seems.\n\n“We are all praying that the Mother grants Lady Corbray an easy labor and a healthy child,” said Myranda.\n\nAlayne could not help herself. She smiled and said, “My father is always pleased to be of service to one of Lord Robert’s leal bannermen. I’m sure he would be most delighted to help broker a marriage for you as well, Ser Lyn.”\n\n“How kind of him.” Corbray’s lips drew back in something that might have been meant as a smile, though it gave Alayne a chill. “But what need have I for heirs when I am landless and like to remain so, thanks to our Lord Protector?  No.  Tell your lord father I need none of his brood mares.”\n\nThe venom in his voice was so thick that for a moment she almost forgot that Lyn Corbray was actually her father’s catspaw, bought and paid for. Or was he?  Perhaps, instead of being Petyr’s man pretending to be Petyr’s foe, he was actually his foe pretending to be his man pretending to be his foe.\n\nJust thinking about it was enough to make her head spin. Alayne turned abruptly from the yard… and bumped into a short, sharp-faced man with a brush of orange hair who had come up behind her.  His hand shot out and caught her arm before she could fall.   “My lady.  My pardons if I took you unawares.”\n\n“The fault was mine. I did not see you standing there.”\n\n“We mice are quiet creatures.” Ser Shadrich was so short that he might have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much older man. She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of his mouth, old battles in the scar beneath his ear, and a hardness behind the eyes that no boy would ever have. This was a man grown. Even Randa overtopped him, though.\n\n“Will you be seeking wings?” the Royce girl said.\n\n“A mouse with wings would be a silly sight.”\n\n“Perhaps you will try the melee instead?” Alayne suggested.  The melee was an afterthought, a sop for all the brothers, uncles, fathers, and friends who had accompanied the competitors to the Gates of the Moon to see them win their silver wings, but there would be prizes for the champions, and a chance to win ransoms.\n\n“A good melee is all a hedge knight can hope for, unless he stumbles on a bag of dragons. And that’s not likely, is it?”\n\n“I suppose not. But now you must excuse us, ser, we need to find my lord father. “\n\nHorns sounded from atop the wall.  “Too late,” Myranda said. “They’re here.  We shall need to do the honors by ourselves.”  She grinned.   “Last one to the gate must marry Uther Shett.”\n\nThey made a race of it, dashing headlong across the yard and past the stables, skirts flapping, whilst knights and serving men alike looked on, and pigs and chickens scattered before them. It was most unladylike, but Alayne sound found herself laughing. For just a little while, as she ran, she forget who she was, and where, and found herself remembering bright cold days at Winterfell, when she would race through Winterfell with her friend Jeyne Poole, with Arya running after them trying to keep up.\n\nBy the time they arrived at the gatehouse, both of them were red-faced and panting. Myranda had lost her cloak somewhere along the way. They were just in time. The portcullis had been raised, and a column of riders twenty strong were passing underneath. At their head rode Anya Waynwood, Lady of Ironoaks, stern and slim, her grey-brown hair bound up in a scarf. Her riding cloak was heavy green wool trimmed with brown fur, and clasped at the throat by a niello brooch in the shape of the broken wheel of her House.\n\nMyranda Royce stepped forward and sketched a curtsy. “Lady Anya. Welcome to the Gates of the Moon.”\n\n“Lady Myranda. Lady Alayne.” Anya Waynwood inclined her head to each of them in turn. “It is good of you to greet us. Allow me to present my grandson, Ser Roland Waynwood.”  She nodded at the knight who had spoken.  “And this is my youngest son, Ser Wallace Waynwood.  And of course my ward, Ser Harrold Hardyng.”\n\nHarry the Heir, Alayne thought. My husband-to-be, if he will have me.  A sudden terror filled her.  She wondered if her face was red. Don’t stare at him, she reminded herself, don’t stare, don’t gape, don’t gawk.  Look away. Her hair must be a frightful mess after all that running.  It took all her will to stop herself from trying to tuck the loose strands back into place. Never mind your stupid hair.  Your hair doesn’t matter.  It’s him that matters.  Him, and the Waynwoods.\n\nSer Roland was the oldest of the three, though no more than five-and-twenty. He was taller and more muscular than Ser Wallace, but both were long-faced and lantern-jawed, with stringy brown hair and pinched noses.  Horsefaced and homely, Alayne thought.\n\nHarry, though…\n\nMy Harry.  My lord, my lover, my betrothed.\n\nSer Harrold Hardyng looked every inch a lord-in-waiting; clean-limbed and handsome, straight as a lance, hard with muscle. Men old enough to have known Jon Arryn in his youth said Ser Harrold had his look, she knew. He had a mop of sandy blond hair, pale blue eyes, an aquiline nose. Joffrey was comely too, though, she reminded herself.   A comely monster, that’s what he was.  Little Lord Tyrion was kinder, twisted though he was.\n\nHarry was staring at her. He knows who I am, she realized, and he does not seem pleased to see me. It was only then that she took note of his heraldry. Though his surcoat and horse trappings were patterned in the red-and-white diamonds of House Hardyng, his shield was quartered. The arms of Hardyng and Waynwood were displayed in the first and third quarters, respectively, but in the second and fourth quarters he bore the moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky blue and cream. Sweetrobin will not like that.\n\nSer Wallace said, “Are we the l-l-last?”\n\n“You are, sers,” replied Myranda Royce, taking absolutely no notice of his stammer.\n\n“Wh-wh-when will the t-t-tilts commence?”\n\n“Oh, soon, I pray,” said Randa. “Some of the competitors have been here for almost a moon’s turn, partaking of my father’s meat and mead. All good fellows, and very brave… but they do eat rather a lot.”\n\nThe Waynwoods laughed, and even Harry the Heir cracked a thin smile. “It was snowing in the passes, else we would have been here sooner,” said Lady Anya.\n\n“Had we known such beauty awaited us at the Gates, we would have flown,” Ser Roland said.  Though his words were addressed to Myranda Royce, he smiled at Alayne as he said them.\n\n“To fly you would need wings,” Randa replied, “and there are some knights here who might have a thing to say concerning that.”\n\n“I look forward to a spirited discussion.” Ser Roland swung down from his horse, turned to Alayne, and smiled.  “I had heard that Lord Littlefinger’s daughter was fair of face and full of grace, but no one ever told me that she was a thief.”\n\n“You wrong me, ser. I am no thief!”\n\nSer Roland placed his hand over his heart. “Then how do you explain this hole in my chest, from where you stole my heart?”\n\n“He is only t-teasing you, my lady,” stammered Ser Wallace. “My n-n-nephew never had a h-h-heart.”\n\n“The Waynwood wheel has a broken spoke, and we have my nuncle here.” Ser Roland gave Wallace a whap behind the ear.  “Squires should be quiet when knights are speaking.”\n\nSer Wallace reddened.  “I am no more a s-squire, my lady.  My n-nephew knows full well that I was k-k-kni-k-k-kni –“\n\n“Dubbed?” Alayne suggested gently.\n\n“Dubbed,” said Wallace Waynwood, gratefully.\n\nRobb would be his age, if he were still alive, she could not help but think, but Robb died a king, and this is just a boy.\n\n“My lord father has assigned you rooms in the East Tower,” Lady Myranda was telling Lady Waynwood, “but I fear your knights will need to share a bed. The Gates of the Moon were never meant to house so many noble visitors.”\n\n“You are in the Falcon Tower, Ser Harrold,” Alayne put in. Far away from Sweetrobin. That was intentional, she knew. Petyr Baelish did not leave such things to chance. “If it please you, I will show you to your chambers myself.” This time her eyes met Harry’s.  She smiled just for him, and said a silent prayer to the Maiden. Please, he doesn’t need to love me, just make him like me, just a little, that would be enough for now.\n\nSer Harrold looked down at her coldly. “Why should it please me to be escorted anywhere by Littlefinger’s bastard?”\n\nAll three Waynwoods looked at him askance. “You are a guest here, Harry,” Lady Anya reminded him, in a frosty voice. “See that you remember that.”\n\nA lady’s armor is her courtesy. Alayne could feel the blood rushing to her face. No tears, she prayed. Please, please, I must not cry. “As you wish, ser. And now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger’s bastard must find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can begin the tourney on the morrow.”  And may your horse stumble, Harry the Heir, so you fall on your stupid head in your first tilt. She showed the Waynwoods a stone face as they blurted out awkward apologies for their companion. When they were done she turned and fled.\n\nNear the keep, she ran headlong into Ser Lothor Brune and almost knocked him off his feet. “Harry the Heir?  Harry the Arse, I say. He’s just some upjumped squire.”\n\nAlayne was so grateful that she hugged him. “Thank you. Have you seen my father, ser?”\n\n“Down in the vaults, ” Ser Lothar said, “inspecting Lord Nestor’s granaries with Lord Grafton and Lord Belmore.”\n\nThe vaults were large and dark and filthy. Alayne lit a taper and clutched her skirt as she made the descent. Near the bottom, she heard Lord Grafton’s booming voice, and followed.”The merchants are clamoring to buy, and the lords are clamoring to sell,” the Gulltowner was saying when she found them.  Though not a tall man, Grafton was wide, with thick arms and shoulders.  His hair was a dirty blond mop.  “How am I to stop that, my lord?”\n\n“Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does not matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale. “\n\n“These prices, though,”  protested fat Lord Belmore,”  these prices are more than fair.”\n\n“You say more than fair, my lord.  I say less than we would wish.  Wait.  If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored.  Winter is coming.  Prices must go higher.”\n\n“Perhaps,”  said Belmore, doubtfully.\n\n“Bronze Yohn will not wait, ”  Grafton complained.  “He need not ship through Gulltown, he has his own ports.  Whilst we are hoarding our harvest, Royce and the other Lords Declarant will turn theirs into silver, you may be sure of that.”\n\n“Let us hope so,”  said Petyr.  “When their granaries are empty, they will need every scrap of that silver to buy sustenance from us.  And now if you will excuse me, my lord, it would seem my daughter has need of me.”\n\n“Lady Alayne,” Lord Grafton said. “You look bright-eyed this morning.”\n\n“You are kind to say so, my lord. Father, I am sorry to disturb you, but I thought you would want to know that the Waynwoods have arrived.”\n\n“And is Ser Harrold with them?”\n\nHorrible Ser Harrold.  “ He is.”\n\nLord Belmore laughed. “I never thought Royce would let him come. Is he blind, or merely stupid?”\n\n“He is honorable.  Sometimes it amounts to the same thing.  If he denied the lad the chance to prove himself, it could create a rift between them, so why not let him tilt?  The boy is nowise skilled enough to win a place amongst the Winged Knights.”\n\n“I suppose not,” said Belmore, grudgingly.  Lord Grafton kissed Alayne on the hand, and the two lords went off, leaving her alone with her lord father.\n\n“Come,” Petyr said, “walk with me.”  He took her by the arm and led her deeper into the vaults, past an empty dungeon.  “And how was your first meeting with Harry the Heir?”\n\n“He’s horrible.”\n\n“The world is full of horrors, sweet.  By now you ought to know that.  You’ve seen enough of them.”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “but why must he be so cruel?  He called me your bastard.  Right in the yard, in front of everyone.”\n\n“So far as he knows, that’s who you are.  This betrothal was never his idea, and Bronze Yohn has no doubt warned him against my wiles.  You are my daughter.  He does not trust you, and he believes that you’re beneath him.”\n\n“Well, I’m not.  He may think he’s some great knight, but Ser Lothor says he’s just some upjumped squire.”\n\nPetyr put his arm around her.  “So he is, but he is Robert’s heir as well.  Bringing Harry here was the first step in our plan, but now we need to keep him, and only you can do that.  He has a weakness for a pretty face, and whose face is prettier than yours?  Charm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.”\n\n“I don’t know how,”  she said miserably.\n\n“Oh, I think you do,” said Littlefinger, with one of those smiles that did not reach his eyes.  “You will be the most beautiful woman in the hall tonight, as lovely as your lady mother at your age.  I cannot seat you on the dais, but you’ll have a place of honor above the salt and underneath a wall sconce.  The fire will be shining in your hair, so everyone will see how fair of face you are.  Keep a good long spoon on hand to beat the squires off, sweetling.  You will not want green boys underfoot when the knights come round to beg you for your favor.”\n\n“Who would ask to wear a bastard’s favor?”\n\n“Harry, if he has the wits the gods gave a goose… but do not give it to him.  Choose some other gallant, and favor him instead.  You do not want to seem too eager.”\n\n“No,” Alayne said.\n\n“Lady Waynwood will insist that Harry dance with you, I can promise you that much.  That will be your chance. Smile at the boy.  Touch him when you speak.  Tease him, to pique his pride.  If he seems to be responding, tell him that you are feeling faint, and ask him to take you outside for a breath of fresh air.  No knight could refuse such a request from a fair maiden.”\n\n“Yes,” she said, “but he thinks that I’m a bastard.”\n\n“A beautiful bastard, and the Lord Protector’s daughter.”  Petyr drew her close and kissed her on both cheeks.  “The night belongs to you, sweetling, Remember that, always.”\n\n“I’ll try, father,” she said.\n\nThe feast proved to be everything her father promised.\n\nSixty-four dishes were served, in honor of the sixty-four competitors who had come so far to contest for silver wings before their lord. From the rivers and the lakes came pike and trout and salmon, from the seas crabs and cod and herring. Ducks there were, and capons, peacocks in their plumage and swans in almond milk. Suckling pigs were served up crackling with apples in their mouths, and three huge aurochs were roasted whole above firepits in the castle yard, since they were too big to get through the kitchen doors. Loaves of hot bread filled the trestle tables in Lord Nestor’s hall, and massive wheels of cheese were brought up from the vaults.  The butter was fresh-churned, and there were leeks and carrots, roasted onions, beets, turnips, parsnips.  And best of all, Lord Nestor’s cooks prepared a splendid subtlety, a lemon cake in the shape of the Giant’s Lance, twelve feet tall and adorned with an Eyrie made of sugar.\n\nFor me, Alayne thought, as they wheeled it out.  Sweetrobin loved lemon cakes too, but only after she told him that they were her favorites.  The cake had required every lemon in the Vale, but Petyr had promised that he would send to Dorne for more.\n\nThere were gifts as well, splendid gifts.  Each of the competitors received a cloak of cloth-of-silver and a lapis brooch in the shape of a pair of falcon’s wings.  Fine steel daggers were given to the brothers, fathers, and friends who had come to watch them tilt.  For their mothers, sisters, and ladies fair there were bolts of silk and Myrish lace.\n\n“Lord Nestor has an open hand,” Alayne heard Ser Edmund Breakstone say.  “An open hand and a little finger,” Lady Waynwood replied, with a nod toward Petyr Baelish.   Breakstone was not slow to take her meaning.  The true source of this largesse was not Lord Nestor, but the Lord Protector.\n\nWhen the last course had been served and cleared, the tables were lifted from their trestles to clear the floor for dancing, and musicians were brought in.\n\n“Are there no singers?” asked Ben Coldwater.\n\n“The little lord cannot abide them,” Ser Lymond Lynderly replied.  “Not since Marillion.”\n\n“Ah… that was the man who murdered Lady Lysa, yes?”\n\nAlayne spoke up. “His singing pleased her greatly, and she showed him too much favor, perhaps.  When she wed my father he went mad and pushed her out the Moon Door.  Lord Robert has hated singing ever since.  He is still fond of music, though.”\n\n“As am I,” Coldwater said.  Rising, he offered Alayne his hand.  “Would you honor me with this dance, my lady?”\n\n“You’re very kind,” she said, as he led her to the floor.\n\nHe was her first partner of the evening, but far from the last.  Just as Petyr had promised, the young knights flocked around her, vying for her favor.  After Ben came Andrew Tollett, handsome Ser Byron, red-nosed Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse.  Then Ser Albar Royce, Myranda’s stout dull brother and Lord Nestor’s heir.  She danced with all three Sunderlands, none of whom had webs between their fingers, though she could not vouch for their toes.  Uther Shett appeared to pay her slimy compliments as he trod upon her feet, but Ser Targon the Halfwild proved to be the soul of courtesy.  After that Ser Roland Waynwood swept her up and made her laugh with mocking comments about half the other knights in the hall.  His uncle Wallace took a turn as well and tried to do the same, but the words would not come.  Alayne finally took pity on him and began to chatter happily, to spare him the embarrassment.  When the dance was done she excused herself, and went back to her place to have a drink of wine.\n\nAnd there he stood, Harry the Heir himself; tall, handsome, scowling.  “Lady Alayne. May I partner you in this dance?”\n\nShe considered for a moment. “No. I don’t think so.”\n\nColor rose to his cheeks.  “I was unforgiveably rude to you in the yard.  You must forgive me.”\n\n“Must?” She tossed her hair, took a sip of wine, made him wait.  “How can you forgive someone who is unforgiveably rude?  Will you explain that to me, ser?”\n\nSer Harrold looked confused. “Please.  One dance.”\n\nCharm him.  Entrance him.  Bewitch him.  “If you insist.”\n\nHe nodded, offered his arm, led her out onto the floor.  As they waited for the music to resume, Alayne glanced at the dais, where Lord Robert sat staring at them.  Please, she prayed, don’t let him start to twitch and shake.  Not here.  Not now.  Maester Coleman would have made certain that he drank a strong dose of sweetmilk before the feast, but even so.\n\nThen the musicians took up a tune, and she was dancing.\n\nSay something, she urged herself.  You will never make Ser Harry love you if you don’t have the courage to talk him.  Should she tell him what a good dancer he was?  No, he’s probably heard that a dozen times tonight.  Besides, Petyr said that I should not seem eager.  Instead she said, “I have heard that you are about to be a father.”  It was not something most girls would say to their almost-betrothed, but she wanted to see if Ser Harrold would lie.\n\n“For the second time. My daughter Alys is two years old.”\n\nYour bastard daughter Alys, Alayne thought, but what she said was, “That one had a different mother, though.”\n\n“Yes. Cissy was a pretty thing when I tumbled her, but childbirth left her as fat as a cow, so Lady Anya arranged for her to marry one of her men-at-arms.  It is different with Saffron.”\n\n“Saffron?”  Alayne tried not to laugh.  “Truly?”\n\nSer Harrold had the grace to blush.  “Her father says she is more precious to him than gold.  He’s rich, the richest man in Gulltown.  A fortune in spices.”\n\n“What will you name the babe?” she asked.  “Cinnamon if she’s a girl?  Cloves if he’s a boy?”\n\nThat almost made him stumble.  “My lady japes.”\n\n“Oh, no.”  Petyr will howl when I tell him what I said.\n\n“Saffron is very beautiful, I’ll have you know.  Tall and slim, with big brown eyes and hair like honey.”\n\nAlayne raised her head.  “More beautiful than me?”\n\nSer Harrold studied her face. “You are comely enough, I grant you.  When Lady Anya first told me of this match, I was afraid that you might look like your father.”\n\n“Little pointy beard and all?”  Alayne laughed.\n\n“I never meant… “\n\n“I hope you joust better than you talk.”\n\nFor a moment he looked shocked.  But as the song was ending, he burst into a laugh.  “No one told me you were clever.”\n\nHe has good teeth, she thought, straight and white.  And when he smiles, he has the nicest dimples.  She ran one finger down his cheek.  “Should we ever wed, you’ll have to send Saffron back to her father.  I’ll be all the spice you’ll want.”\n\nHe grinned.  “I will hold you to that promise, my lady.  Until that day, may I wear your favor in the tourney?”\n\n“You may not.  It is promised to… another.”  She was not sure who as yet, but she knew she would find someone.\n","slug":"ALAYNE","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.496Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vks3000kpmnk3sqacfts","content":"<h2 id=\"alayne--excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter\">ALAYNE--EXCERPT FROM\nTHE WINDS OF WINTER</h2>\n<p>She was reading her little lord a tale of the Winged Knight when Mya\nStone came knocking on the door of his bedchamber, clad in boots and\nriding leathers and smelling strongly of the stable. Mya had straw in\nher hair and a scowl on her face. That scowl comes of having Mychel\nRedfort near, Alayne knew.</p>\n<p>“Your lordship,” Mya informed Lord Robert, “Lady Waynwood’s banners\nhave been seen an hour down the road. She will be here soon, with your\ncousin Harry. Will you want to greet them?”</p>\n<p>Why did she have to mention Harry? Alayne thought. We will never get\nSweetrobin out of bed now. The boy slapped a pillow. “Send them away. I\nnever asked them here.” <span id=\"more\"></span> Mya looked nonplussed. No one in\nthe Vale was better at handling a mule, but lordlings were another\nmatter. “They were invited,” she said uncertainly, “for the tourney. I\ndon’t… “</p>\n<p>Alayne closed her book. “Thank you, Mya. Let me talk with Lord\nRobert, if you would.”</p>\n<p>Relief plain on her face, Mya fled without another word.</p>\n<p>“I hate that Harry,” Sweetrobin said when she was gone. “He calls me\ncousin, but he’s just waiting for me to die so he can take the Eyrie. He\nthinks I don’t know, but I do.”</p>\n<p>“Your lordship should not believe such nonsense,” Alayne said. “I’m\nsure Ser Harrold loves you well.” And if the gods are good, he will love\nme too. Her tummy gave a little flutter.</p>\n<p>“He doesn’t,” Lord Robert insisted. “He wants my father’s castle,\nthat’s all, so he pretends.” The boy clutched the blanket to his pimply\nchest. “I don’t want you to marry him, Alayne. I am the Lord of the\nEyrie, and I forbid it.” He sounded as if he were about to cry. “You\nshould marry me instead. We could sleep in the same bed every night, and\nyou could read me stories.”</p>\n<p>No man can wed me so long as my dwarf husband still lives somewhere\nin this world. Queen Cersei had collected the head of a dozen dwarfs,\nPetyr claimed, but none were Tyrion’s. “Sweetrobin, you must not say\nsuch things. You are the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, and\nyou must wed a highborn lady and father a son to sit in the High Hall of\nHouse Arryn after you are gone.”</p>\n<p>Robert wiped his nose. “But I want — “</p>\n<p>She put a finger to his lips. “I know what you want, but it cannot\nbe. I am no fit wife for you. I am bastard born.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t care. I love you best of anyone. “</p>\n<p>You are such a little fool. “Your lords bannermen will care. Some\ncall my father upjumped and ambitious. If you were to take me to wife,\nthey would say that he made you do it, that it was no will of yours. The\nLords Declarant might take arms against him once again, and he and I\nshould both be put to death.”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t let them hurt you!” Lord Robert said. “If they try I will\nmake them all fly.” His hand began to tremble.</p>\n<p>Alayne stroked his fingers. “There, my Sweetrobin, be still now.”\nWhen the shaking passed, she said, “You must have a proper wife, a\ntrueborn maid of noble birth.”</p>\n<p>“No. I want to marry you, Alayne.”</p>\n<p>Once your lady mother intended that very thing, but I was trueborn\nthen, and noble. “My lord is kind to say so.” Alayne smoothed his hair.\nLady Lysa had never let the servants touch it, and after she had died\nRobert had suffered terrible shaking fits whenever anyone came near him\nwith a blade, so it had been allowed to grow until it tumbled over his\nround shoulders and halfway down his flabby white chest. He does have\npretty hair. If the gods are good and he lives long enough to wed, his\nwife will admire his hair, surely. That much she will love about him.\n“Any child of ours would be baseborn. Only a trueborn child of House\nArryn can displace Ser Harrold as your heir. My father will find a\nproper wife for you, some highborn girl much prettier than me. You’ll\nhunt and hawk together, and she’ll give you her favor to wear in\ntournaments. Before long, you will have forgotten me entirely.”</p>\n<p>“I won’t!”</p>\n<p>“You will. You must.” Her voice was firm, but gentle.</p>\n<p>“The Lord of the Eyrie can do as he likes. Can’t I still love you,\neven if I have to marry her? Ser Harrold has a common woman. Benjicot\nsays she’s carrying his bastard.”</p>\n<p>Benjicot should learn to keep his fool’s mouth shut. “Is that what\nyou would have from me? A bastard?” She pulled her fingers from his\ngrasp. “Would you dishonor me that way?”</p>\n<p>The boy looked stricken. “No. I never meant — “</p>\n<p>Alayne stood. “If it please my lord, I must go and find my father.\nSomeone needs to greet Lady Waynwood.” Before her little lord could find\nthe words to protest, she gave him a quick curtsy and fled the\nbedchamber, sweeping down the hall and across a covered bridge to the\nLord Protector’s apartments.</p>\n<p>When she had left Petyr Baelish that morning he had been breaking his\nfast with old Oswell who had arrived last night from Gulltown on a\nlathered horse. She hoped they might still be talking, but Petyr’s solar\nproved empty. Someone had left a window open and a stack of papers had\nblown onto the floor. The sun was slanting through the thick yellow\nwindows, and dust motes danced in the light like tiny golden insects.\nThough snow had blanketed the heights of the Giant’s Lance above, below\nthe mountain the autumn lingered and winter wheat was ripening in the\nfields. Outside the window she could hear the laughter of the\nwasherwomen at the well, the din of steel on steel from the ward where\nthe knights were at their drills. Good sounds.</p>\n<p>Alayne loved it here. She felt alive again, for the first since her\nfather… since Lord Eddard Stark had died.</p>\n<p>She closed the window, gathered up the fallen papers, and stacked\nthem on the table. One was a list of the competitors. Four-and-sixty\nknights had been invited to vie for places amongst Lord Robert Arryn’s\nnew Brotherhood of Winged Knights, and four­ and-sixty knights had come\nto tilt for the right to wear falcon’s wings upon their warhelms and\nguard their lord.</p>\n<p>The competitors came from all over the Vale, from the mountain\nvalleys and the coast, from Gulltown and the Bloody Gate, even the Three\nSisters. Though a few were promised, only three were wed; the eight\nvictors would be expected to spend the next three years at Lord Robert’s\nside, as his own personal guard (Alayne had suggested seven, like the\nKingsguard, but Sweetrobin had insisted that he must have more knights\nthan King Tommen), so older men with wives and children had not been\ninvited.</p>\n<p>And they came, Alayne thought proudly. They all came.</p>\n<p>It had fallen out just as Petyr said it would, the day the ravens\nflew. “They’re young, eager, hungry for adventure and renown. Lysa would\nnot let them go to war. This is the next best thing. A chance to serve\ntheir lord and prove their prowess. They will come. Even Harry the\nHeir.” He had smoothed her hair and kissed her forehead. “What a clever\ndaughter you are.”</p>\n<p>It was clever. The tourney, the prizes, the winged knights, it had\nall been her own notion. Lord Robert’s mother had filled him full of\nfears, but he always took courage from the tales she read him of Ser\nArtys Arryn, the Winged Knight of legend, founder of his line. Why not\nsurround him with Winged Knights? She had thought one night, after\nSweetrobin had finally drifted off to sleep. His own Kingsguard, to keep\nhim safe and make him brave. And no sooner did she tell Petyr her idea\nthan he went out and made it happen. He will want to be there to greet\nSer Harrold. Where could he have gone?</p>\n<p>Alayne swept down the tower stairs to enter the pillared gallery at\nthe back of the Great Hall. Below her, serving men were setting up\ntrestle tables for the evening feast, while their wives and daughters\nswept up the old rushes and scattered fresh ones. Lord Nestor was\nshowing Lady Waxley his prize tapestries, with their scenes of hunt and\nchase. The same panels had once hung in the Red Keep of King’s Landing,\nwhen Robert sat the Iron Throne. Joffrey had them taken down and they\nhad languished in some cellar until Petyr Baelish arranged for them to\nbe brought to the Vale as a gift for Nestor Royce. Not only were the\nhangings beautiful, but the High Steward delighted in telling anyone\nwho’d listen that they had once belonged to a king.</p>\n<p>Petyr was not in the Great Hall. Alayne crossed the gallery and\ndescended the stair built into the thick west wall, to come out in the\ninner ward, where the jousting would be held. Viewing stands had raised\nfor all those who had come to watch, with four long tilting barriers in\nbetween. Lord Nestor’s men were painting the barriers with whitewash,\ndraping the stands with bright banners, and hanging shields on the gate\nthe competitors would pass through when they made their entrance.</p>\n<p>At the north end of the yard, three quintains had been set up, and\nsome of the competitors were riding at them. Alayne knew them by their\nshields; the bells of Belmore, green vipers for the Lynderlys, the red\nsledge of Breakstone, House Tollett’s black and grey pily. Ser Mychel\nRedfort set one quintain spinning with a perfectly placed blow. He was\none of those favored to win wings.</p>\n<p>Petyr was not at the quintains, nor anywhere in the yard, but as she\nturned to go a woman’s voice called out. “Alayne!” cried Myranda Royce,\nfrom a carved stone bench beneath a beech tree, where she was seated\nbetween two men. She looked in need of rescue. Smiling, Alayne walked\ntoward her friend.</p>\n<p>Myranda was wearing a grey woolen dress, a green hooded cloak, and a\nrather desperate look. On either side of her sat a knight. The one on\nher right had a grizzled beard, a bald head, and a belly that spilled\nover his swordbelt where his lap should have been. The one on her left\nwas no more than eighteen, and skinny as a spear. His ginger-colored\nwhiskers only partially served to disguise the angry red pimples that\ndotted his face.</p>\n<p>The bald knight wore a dark blue surcoat emblazoned with a huge pair\nof pink lips. The pimply-gingerlad countered with nine white seagulls on\na field of brown, which marked him for a Shett of Gulltown. He was\nstaring so intently at Myranda’s breasts that he hardly noticed Alayne\nuntil Myranda rose to hug her. “Thank you, thank you, thank you ” Randa\nwhispered in her ear, before she turned to say, “Sers, may I present you\nthe Lady Alayne Stone?”</p>\n<p>“The Lord Protector’s daughter,” the bald knight announced, all\nhearty gallantry. He rose ponderously. “And full as lovely as the tales\ntold of her, I see.”</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, the pimply knight hopped up and said, “Ser Ossifer\nspeaks truly, you are the most beautiful maid in all the Seven\nKingdoms.” It might have been a sweeter courtesy had he not addressed it\nto her chest.</p>\n<p>“And have you seen all those maids yourself, ser?” Alayne asked him.\n“You are young to be so widely travelled.”</p>\n<p>He blushed, which only made his pimples look angrier. “No, my lady. I\nam from Gulltown.”</p>\n<p>And I am not, though Alayne was born there. She would need to be\ncareful around this one. “I remember Gulltown fondly,” she told him,\nwith a smile as vague as it was pleasant. To Myranda she said, “Do you\nknow where my father’s gotten to, perchance?”</p>\n<p>“Let me take you to him, my lady.”</p>\n<p>“I do hope you will forgive me for depriving you of Lady Myranda’s\ncompany,” Alayne told the knights. She did not wait for a reply, but\ntook the older girl arm-in-arm and drew her away from the bench. Only\nwhen they were out of earshot did she whisper, “Do you really know where\nmy father is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not. Walk faster, my new suitors may be following.”\nMyranda made a face. “Ossifer Lipps is the dullest knight in the Vale,\nbut Uther Shett aspires to his laurels. I am praying they fight a duel\nfor my hand, and kill each other.”</p>\n<p>Alayne giggled. “Surely Lord Nestor would not seriously entertain a\nsuit from such men.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, he might. My lord father is annoyed with me for killing my last\nhusband and putting him to all this trouble.”</p>\n<p>“It was not your fault he died.”</p>\n<p>“There was no one else in the bed that I recall.”</p>\n<p>Alayne could not help but shutter. Myranda’s husband had died when he\nwas making love with her. “Those Sistermen who came in yesterday were\ngallant,” she said, to change the subject. “If you don’t like Ser\nOssifer or Ser Uther, marry one of them instead. I thought the youngest\none was very handsome.”</p>\n<p>“The one in the sealskin cloak?” Randa said, incredulous.</p>\n<p>“One of his brothers, then.”</p>\n<p>Myranda rolled her eyes. “They’re from the Sisters. Did you ever know\na Sisterman who could joust? They clean their swords with codfish oil\nand wash in tubs of cold seawater.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Alayne said, “at least they’re clean.”</p>\n<p>“Some of them have webs between their toes. I’d sooner marry Lord\nPetyr. Then I’d be your mother. How little is his finger, I ask\nyou?”</p>\n<p>Alayne did not dignify that question with an answer. “Lady Waynwood\nwill be here soon, with her sons.”</p>\n<p>“Is that a promise or a threat?” Myranda said. “The first Lady\nWaynwood must have been a mare, I think. How else to explain why all the\nWaynwood men are horse-faced? If I were ever to wed a Waynwood, he would\nhave to swear a vow to don his helm whenever he wished to fuck me, and\nkeep the visor closed.” She gave Alayne a pinch on the arm. “My Harry\nwill be with them, though. I notice that you left him out. I shall never\nforgive you for stealing him away from me. He’s the boy I want to\nmarry.”</p>\n<p>“The betrothal was my father’s doing,” Alayne protested, as she had a\nhundred times before. She is only teasing, she told herself… but behind\nthe japes, she could hear the hurt.</p>\n<p>Myranda stopped to gaze across the yard at the knights at their\npractice. “Now there’s the very sort of husband I need.”</p>\n<p>A few feet away, two knights were fighting with blunted practice\nswords. Their blades crashed together twice, then slipped past each\nother only to be blocked by upraised shields, but the bigger man gave\nground at the impact. Alayne could not see the front of his shield from\nwhere she stood, but his attacker bore three ravens in flight, each\nclutching a red heart in its claws. Three hearts and three ravens.</p>\n<p>She knew right then how the fight would end.</p>\n<p>A few moments later and the big man sprawled dazed in the dust with\nhis helm askew. When his squire undid the fastenings to bare his head,\nthere was blood trickling down his scalp. If the swords had not been\nblunted, there would be brains as well. That last head blow had been so\nhard Alayne had winced in sympathy when it fell. Myranda Royce\nconsidered the victor thoughtfully. “Do you think if I asked nicely Ser\nLyn would kill my suitors for me?”</p>\n<p>“He might, for a plump bag of gold.” Ser Lyn Corbray was forever\ndesperately short of coin, all the Vale knew that.</p>\n<p>“Alas, all I have is a plump pair of teats. Though with Ser Lyn, a\nplump sausage under my skirts would serve me better.”</p>\n<p>Alayne’s giggle drew Corbray’s attention. He handed his shield to his\nloutish squire, removed his helm and quilted coif. “Ladies.” His long\nbrown hair was plastered to his brow by sweat.</p>\n<p>“Well struck, Ser Lyn,” Alayne called out. “Though I fear you’ve\nknocked poor Ser Owen insensible.”</p>\n<p>Corbray glanced back to where his foe was being helped from the yard\nby his squire. “He had no sense to start with, or he should not have\ntried me.”</p>\n<p>There is truth in that, Alayne thought, but some demon of mischief\nwas in her that morning, so she gave Ser Lyn a thrust of her own.\nSmiling sweetly, she said, “My lord father tells me your brother’s new\nwife is with child.”</p>\n<p>Corbray gave her a dark look. “Lyonel sends his regrets. He remains\nat Heart’s Home with his peddler’s daughter, watching her belly swell as\nif he were the first man who ever got a wench pregnant.”</p>\n<p>Oh, that’s an open wound, thought Alayne. Lyonel Corbray’s first wife\nhad given him nothing but a frail, sickly babe who died in infancy, and\nduring all those years Ser Lyn had remained his brother’s heir. When the\npoor woman finally died, however, Petyr Baelish had stepped in and\nbrokered a new marriage for Lord Corbray. The second Lady Corbray was\nsixteen, the daughter of a wealthy Gulltown merchant, but she had come\nwith an immense dowry, and men said she was a tall, strapping, healthy\ngirl, with big breasts and good, wide hips. And fertile too, it\nseems.</p>\n<p>“We are all praying that the Mother grants Lady Corbray an easy labor\nand a healthy child,” said Myranda.</p>\n<p>Alayne could not help herself. She smiled and said, “My father is\nalways pleased to be of service to one of Lord Robert’s leal bannermen.\nI’m sure he would be most delighted to help broker a marriage for you as\nwell, Ser Lyn.”</p>\n<p>“How kind of him.” Corbray’s lips drew back in something that might\nhave been meant as a smile, though it gave Alayne a chill. “But what\nneed have I for heirs when I am landless and like to remain so, thanks\nto our Lord Protector? No. Tell your lord father I need none of his\nbrood mares.”</p>\n<p>The venom in his voice was so thick that for a moment she almost\nforgot that Lyn Corbray was actually her father’s catspaw, bought and\npaid for. Or was he? Perhaps, instead of being Petyr’s man pretending to\nbe Petyr’s foe, he was actually his foe pretending to be his man\npretending to be his foe.</p>\n<p>Just thinking about it was enough to make her head spin. Alayne\nturned abruptly from the yard… and bumped into a short, sharp-faced man\nwith a brush of orange hair who had come up behind her. His hand shot\nout and caught her arm before she could fall. “My lady. My pardons if I\ntook you unawares.”</p>\n<p>“The fault was mine. I did not see you standing there.”</p>\n<p>“We mice are quiet creatures.” Ser Shadrich was so short that he\nmight have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much\nolder man. She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of his\nmouth, old battles in the scar beneath his ear, and a hardness behind\nthe eyes that no boy would ever have. This was a man grown. Even Randa\novertopped him, though.</p>\n<p>“Will you be seeking wings?” the Royce girl said.</p>\n<p>“A mouse with wings would be a silly sight.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps you will try the melee instead?” Alayne suggested. The melee\nwas an afterthought, a sop for all the brothers, uncles, fathers, and\nfriends who had accompanied the competitors to the Gates of the Moon to\nsee them win their silver wings, but there would be prizes for the\nchampions, and a chance to win ransoms.</p>\n<p>“A good melee is all a hedge knight can hope for, unless he stumbles\non a bag of dragons. And that’s not likely, is it?”</p>\n<p>“I suppose not. But now you must excuse us, ser, we need to find my\nlord father. “</p>\n<p>Horns sounded from atop the wall. “Too late,” Myranda said. “They’re\nhere. We shall need to do the honors by ourselves.” She grinned. “Last\none to the gate must marry Uther Shett.”</p>\n<p>They made a race of it, dashing headlong across the yard and past the\nstables, skirts flapping, whilst knights and serving men alike looked\non, and pigs and chickens scattered before them. It was most unladylike,\nbut Alayne sound found herself laughing. For just a little while, as she\nran, she forget who she was, and where, and found herself remembering\nbright cold days at Winterfell, when she would race through Winterfell\nwith her friend Jeyne Poole, with Arya running after them trying to keep\nup.</p>\n<p>By the time they arrived at the gatehouse, both of them were\nred-faced and panting. Myranda had lost her cloak somewhere along the\nway. They were just in time. The portcullis had been raised, and a\ncolumn of riders twenty strong were passing underneath. At their head\nrode Anya Waynwood, Lady of Ironoaks, stern and slim, her grey-brown\nhair bound up in a scarf. Her riding cloak was heavy green wool trimmed\nwith brown fur, and clasped at the throat by a niello brooch in the\nshape of the broken wheel of her House.</p>\n<p>Myranda Royce stepped forward and sketched a curtsy. “Lady Anya.\nWelcome to the Gates of the Moon.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Myranda. Lady Alayne.” Anya Waynwood inclined her head to each\nof them in turn. “It is good of you to greet us. Allow me to present my\ngrandson, Ser Roland Waynwood.” She nodded at the knight who had spoken.\n“And this is my youngest son, Ser Wallace Waynwood. And of course my\nward, Ser Harrold Hardyng.”</p>\n<p>Harry the Heir, Alayne thought. My husband-to-be, if he will have me.\nA sudden terror filled her. She wondered if her face was red. Don’t\nstare at him, she reminded herself, don’t stare, don’t gape, don’t gawk.\nLook away. Her hair must be a frightful mess after all that running. It\ntook all her will to stop herself from trying to tuck the loose strands\nback into place. Never mind your stupid hair. Your hair doesn’t matter.\nIt’s him that matters. Him, and the Waynwoods.</p>\n<p>Ser Roland was the oldest of the three, though no more than\nfive-and-twenty. He was taller and more muscular than Ser Wallace, but\nboth were long-faced and lantern-jawed, with stringy brown hair and\npinched noses. Horsefaced and homely, Alayne thought.</p>\n<p>Harry, though…</p>\n<p>My Harry. My lord, my lover, my betrothed.</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold Hardyng looked every inch a lord-in-waiting; clean-limbed\nand handsome, straight as a lance, hard with muscle. Men old enough to\nhave known Jon Arryn in his youth said Ser Harrold had his look, she\nknew. He had a mop of sandy blond hair, pale blue eyes, an aquiline\nnose. Joffrey was comely too, though, she reminded herself. A comely\nmonster, that’s what he was. Little Lord Tyrion was kinder, twisted\nthough he was.</p>\n<p>Harry was staring at her. He knows who I am, she realized, and he\ndoes not seem pleased to see me. It was only then that she took note of\nhis heraldry. Though his surcoat and horse trappings were patterned in\nthe red-and-white diamonds of House Hardyng, his shield was quartered.\nThe arms of Hardyng and Waynwood were displayed in the first and third\nquarters, respectively, but in the second and fourth quarters he bore\nthe moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky blue and cream. Sweetrobin will\nnot like that.</p>\n<p>Ser Wallace said, “Are we the l-l-last?”</p>\n<p>“You are, sers,” replied Myranda Royce, taking absolutely no notice\nof his stammer.</p>\n<p>“Wh-wh-when will the t-t-tilts commence?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, soon, I pray,” said Randa. “Some of the competitors have been\nhere for almost a moon’s turn, partaking of my father’s meat and mead.\nAll good fellows, and very brave… but they do eat rather a lot.”</p>\n<p>The Waynwoods laughed, and even Harry the Heir cracked a thin smile.\n“It was snowing in the passes, else we would have been here sooner,”\nsaid Lady Anya.</p>\n<p>“Had we known such beauty awaited us at the Gates, we would have\nflown,” Ser Roland said. Though his words were addressed to Myranda\nRoyce, he smiled at Alayne as he said them.</p>\n<p>“To fly you would need wings,” Randa replied, “and there are some\nknights here who might have a thing to say concerning that.”</p>\n<p>“I look forward to a spirited discussion.” Ser Roland swung down from\nhis horse, turned to Alayne, and smiled. “I had heard that Lord\nLittlefinger’s daughter was fair of face and full of grace, but no one\never told me that she was a thief.”</p>\n<p>“You wrong me, ser. I am no thief!”</p>\n<p>Ser Roland placed his hand over his heart. “Then how do you explain\nthis hole in my chest, from where you stole my heart?”</p>\n<p>“He is only t-teasing you, my lady,” stammered Ser Wallace. “My\nn-n-nephew never had a h-h-heart.”</p>\n<p>“The Waynwood wheel has a broken spoke, and we have my nuncle here.”\nSer Roland gave Wallace a whap behind the ear. “Squires should be quiet\nwhen knights are speaking.”</p>\n<p>Ser Wallace reddened. “I am no more a s-squire, my lady. My n-nephew\nknows full well that I was k-k-kni-k-k-kni –“</p>\n<p>“Dubbed?” Alayne suggested gently.</p>\n<p>“Dubbed,” said Wallace Waynwood, gratefully.</p>\n<p>Robb would be his age, if he were still alive, she could not help but\nthink, but Robb died a king, and this is just a boy.</p>\n<p>“My lord father has assigned you rooms in the East Tower,” Lady\nMyranda was telling Lady Waynwood, “but I fear your knights will need to\nshare a bed. The Gates of the Moon were never meant to house so many\nnoble visitors.”</p>\n<p>“You are in the Falcon Tower, Ser Harrold,” Alayne put in. Far away\nfrom Sweetrobin. That was intentional, she knew. Petyr Baelish did not\nleave such things to chance. “If it please you, I will show you to your\nchambers myself.” This time her eyes met Harry’s. She smiled just for\nhim, and said a silent prayer to the Maiden. Please, he doesn’t need to\nlove me, just make him like me, just a little, that would be enough for\nnow.</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold looked down at her coldly. “Why should it please me to be\nescorted anywhere by Littlefinger’s bastard?”</p>\n<p>All three Waynwoods looked at him askance. “You are a guest here,\nHarry,” Lady Anya reminded him, in a frosty voice. “See that you\nremember that.”</p>\n<p>A lady’s armor is her courtesy. Alayne could feel the blood rushing\nto her face. No tears, she prayed. Please, please, I must not cry. “As\nyou wish, ser. And now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger’s bastard\nmust find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can\nbegin the tourney on the morrow.” And may your horse stumble, Harry the\nHeir, so you fall on your stupid head in your first tilt. She showed the\nWaynwoods a stone face as they blurted out awkward apologies for their\ncompanion. When they were done she turned and fled.</p>\n<p>Near the keep, she ran headlong into Ser Lothor Brune and almost\nknocked him off his feet. “Harry the Heir? Harry the Arse, I say. He’s\njust some upjumped squire.”</p>\n<p>Alayne was so grateful that she hugged him. “Thank you. Have you seen\nmy father, ser?”</p>\n<p>“Down in the vaults, ” Ser Lothar said, “inspecting Lord Nestor’s\ngranaries with Lord Grafton and Lord Belmore.”</p>\n<p>The vaults were large and dark and filthy. Alayne lit a taper and\nclutched her skirt as she made the descent. Near the bottom, she heard\nLord Grafton’s booming voice, and followed.”The merchants are clamoring\nto buy, and the lords are clamoring to sell,” the Gulltowner was saying\nwhen she found them. Though not a tall man, Grafton was wide, with thick\narms and shoulders. His hair was a dirty blond mop. “How am I to stop\nthat, my lord?”</p>\n<p>“Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does\nnot matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale. “</p>\n<p>“These prices, though,” protested fat Lord Belmore,” these prices are\nmore than fair.”</p>\n<p>“You say more than fair, my lord. I say less than we would wish.\nWait. If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored. Winter is\ncoming. Prices must go higher.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps,” said Belmore, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>“Bronze Yohn will not wait, ” Grafton complained. “He need not ship\nthrough Gulltown, he has his own ports. Whilst we are hoarding our\nharvest, Royce and the other Lords Declarant will turn theirs into\nsilver, you may be sure of that.”</p>\n<p>“Let us hope so,” said Petyr. “When their granaries are empty, they\nwill need every scrap of that silver to buy sustenance from us. And now\nif you will excuse me, my lord, it would seem my daughter has need of\nme.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Alayne,” Lord Grafton said. “You look bright-eyed this\nmorning.”</p>\n<p>“You are kind to say so, my lord. Father, I am sorry to disturb you,\nbut I thought you would want to know that the Waynwoods have\narrived.”</p>\n<p>“And is Ser Harrold with them?”</p>\n<p>Horrible Ser Harrold. “ He is.”</p>\n<p>Lord Belmore laughed. “I never thought Royce would let him come. Is\nhe blind, or merely stupid?”</p>\n<p>“He is honorable. Sometimes it amounts to the same thing. If he\ndenied the lad the chance to prove himself, it could create a rift\nbetween them, so why not let him tilt? The boy is nowise skilled enough\nto win a place amongst the Winged Knights.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose not,” said Belmore, grudgingly. Lord Grafton kissed Alayne\non the hand, and the two lords went off, leaving her alone with her lord\nfather.</p>\n<p>“Come,” Petyr said, “walk with me.” He took her by the arm and led\nher deeper into the vaults, past an empty dungeon. “And how was your\nfirst meeting with Harry the Heir?”</p>\n<p>“He’s horrible.”</p>\n<p>“The world is full of horrors, sweet. By now you ought to know that.\nYou’ve seen enough of them.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said, “but why must he be so cruel? He called me your\nbastard. Right in the yard, in front of everyone.”</p>\n<p>“So far as he knows, that’s who you are. This betrothal was never his\nidea, and Bronze Yohn has no doubt warned him against my wiles. You are\nmy daughter. He does not trust you, and he believes that you’re beneath\nhim.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not. He may think he’s some great knight, but Ser Lothor\nsays he’s just some upjumped squire.”</p>\n<p>Petyr put his arm around her. “So he is, but he is Robert’s heir as\nwell. Bringing Harry here was the first step in our plan, but now we\nneed to keep him, and only you can do that. He has a weakness for a\npretty face, and whose face is prettier than yours? Charm him. Entrance\nhim. Bewitch him.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how,” she said miserably.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I think you do,” said Littlefinger, with one of those smiles\nthat did not reach his eyes. “You will be the most beautiful woman in\nthe hall tonight, as lovely as your lady mother at your age. I cannot\nseat you on the dais, but you’ll have a place of honor above the salt\nand underneath a wall sconce. The fire will be shining in your hair, so\neveryone will see how fair of face you are. Keep a good long spoon on\nhand to beat the squires off, sweetling. You will not want green boys\nunderfoot when the knights come round to beg you for your favor.”</p>\n<p>“Who would ask to wear a bastard’s favor?”</p>\n<p>“Harry, if he has the wits the gods gave a goose… but do not give it\nto him. Choose some other gallant, and favor him instead. You do not\nwant to seem too eager.”</p>\n<p>“No,” Alayne said.</p>\n<p>“Lady Waynwood will insist that Harry dance with you, I can promise\nyou that much. That will be your chance. Smile at the boy. Touch him\nwhen you speak. Tease him, to pique his pride. If he seems to be\nresponding, tell him that you are feeling faint, and ask him to take you\noutside for a breath of fresh air. No knight could refuse such a request\nfrom a fair maiden.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said, “but he thinks that I’m a bastard.”</p>\n<p>“A beautiful bastard, and the Lord Protector’s daughter.” Petyr drew\nher close and kissed her on both cheeks. “The night belongs to you,\nsweetling, Remember that, always.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll try, father,” she said.</p>\n<p>The feast proved to be everything her father promised.</p>\n<p>Sixty-four dishes were served, in honor of the sixty-four competitors\nwho had come so far to contest for silver wings before their lord. From\nthe rivers and the lakes came pike and trout and salmon, from the seas\ncrabs and cod and herring. Ducks there were, and capons, peacocks in\ntheir plumage and swans in almond milk. Suckling pigs were served up\ncrackling with apples in their mouths, and three huge aurochs were\nroasted whole above firepits in the castle yard, since they were too big\nto get through the kitchen doors. Loaves of hot bread filled the trestle\ntables in Lord Nestor’s hall, and massive wheels of cheese were brought\nup from the vaults. The butter was fresh-churned, and there were leeks\nand carrots, roasted onions, beets, turnips, parsnips. And best of all,\nLord Nestor’s cooks prepared a splendid subtlety, a lemon cake in the\nshape of the Giant’s Lance, twelve feet tall and adorned with an Eyrie\nmade of sugar.</p>\n<p>For me, Alayne thought, as they wheeled it out. Sweetrobin loved\nlemon cakes too, but only after she told him that they were her\nfavorites. The cake had required every lemon in the Vale, but Petyr had\npromised that he would send to Dorne for more.</p>\n<p>There were gifts as well, splendid gifts. Each of the competitors\nreceived a cloak of cloth-of-silver and a lapis brooch in the shape of a\npair of falcon’s wings. Fine steel daggers were given to the brothers,\nfathers, and friends who had come to watch them tilt. For their mothers,\nsisters, and ladies fair there were bolts of silk and Myrish lace.</p>\n<p>“Lord Nestor has an open hand,” Alayne heard Ser Edmund Breakstone\nsay. “An open hand and a little finger,” Lady Waynwood replied, with a\nnod toward Petyr Baelish. Breakstone was not slow to take her meaning.\nThe true source of this largesse was not Lord Nestor, but the Lord\nProtector.</p>\n<p>When the last course had been served and cleared, the tables were\nlifted from their trestles to clear the floor for dancing, and musicians\nwere brought in.</p>\n<p>“Are there no singers?” asked Ben Coldwater.</p>\n<p>“The little lord cannot abide them,” Ser Lymond Lynderly replied.\n“Not since Marillion.”</p>\n<p>“Ah… that was the man who murdered Lady Lysa, yes?”</p>\n<p>Alayne spoke up. “His singing pleased her greatly, and she showed him\ntoo much favor, perhaps. When she wed my father he went mad and pushed\nher out the Moon Door. Lord Robert has hated singing ever since. He is\nstill fond of music, though.”</p>\n<p>“As am I,” Coldwater said. Rising, he offered Alayne his hand. “Would\nyou honor me with this dance, my lady?”</p>\n<p>“You’re very kind,” she said, as he led her to the floor.</p>\n<p>He was her first partner of the evening, but far from the last. Just\nas Petyr had promised, the young knights flocked around her, vying for\nher favor. After Ben came Andrew Tollett, handsome Ser Byron, red-nosed\nSer Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse. Then Ser Albar Royce,\nMyranda’s stout dull brother and Lord Nestor’s heir. She danced with all\nthree Sunderlands, none of whom had webs between their fingers, though\nshe could not vouch for their toes. Uther Shett appeared to pay her\nslimy compliments as he trod upon her feet, but Ser Targon the Halfwild\nproved to be the soul of courtesy. After that Ser Roland Waynwood swept\nher up and made her laugh with mocking comments about half the other\nknights in the hall. His uncle Wallace took a turn as well and tried to\ndo the same, but the words would not come. Alayne finally took pity on\nhim and began to chatter happily, to spare him the embarrassment. When\nthe dance was done she excused herself, and went back to her place to\nhave a drink of wine.</p>\n<p>And there he stood, Harry the Heir himself; tall, handsome, scowling.\n“Lady Alayne. May I partner you in this dance?”</p>\n<p>She considered for a moment. “No. I don’t think so.”</p>\n<p>Color rose to his cheeks. “I was unforgiveably rude to you in the\nyard. You must forgive me.”</p>\n<p>“Must?” She tossed her hair, took a sip of wine, made him wait. “How\ncan you forgive someone who is unforgiveably rude? Will you explain that\nto me, ser?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold looked confused. “Please. One dance.”</p>\n<p>Charm him. Entrance him. Bewitch him. “If you insist.”</p>\n<p>He nodded, offered his arm, led her out onto the floor. As they\nwaited for the music to resume, Alayne glanced at the dais, where Lord\nRobert sat staring at them. Please, she prayed, don’t let him start to\ntwitch and shake. Not here. Not now. Maester Coleman would have made\ncertain that he drank a strong dose of sweetmilk before the feast, but\neven so.</p>\n<p>Then the musicians took up a tune, and she was dancing.</p>\n<p>Say something, she urged herself. You will never make Ser Harry love\nyou if you don’t have the courage to talk him. Should she tell him what\na good dancer he was? No, he’s probably heard that a dozen times\ntonight. Besides, Petyr said that I should not seem eager. Instead she\nsaid, “I have heard that you are about to be a father.” It was not\nsomething most girls would say to their almost-betrothed, but she wanted\nto see if Ser Harrold would lie.</p>\n<p>“For the second time. My daughter Alys is two years old.”</p>\n<p>Your bastard daughter Alys, Alayne thought, but what she said was,\n“That one had a different mother, though.”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Cissy was a pretty thing when I tumbled her, but childbirth\nleft her as fat as a cow, so Lady Anya arranged for her to marry one of\nher men-at-arms. It is different with Saffron.”</p>\n<p>“Saffron?” Alayne tried not to laugh. “Truly?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold had the grace to blush. “Her father says she is more\nprecious to him than gold. He’s rich, the richest man in Gulltown. A\nfortune in spices.”</p>\n<p>“What will you name the babe?” she asked. “Cinnamon if she’s a girl?\nCloves if he’s a boy?”</p>\n<p>That almost made him stumble. “My lady japes.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no.” Petyr will howl when I tell him what I said.</p>\n<p>“Saffron is very beautiful, I’ll have you know. Tall and slim, with\nbig brown eyes and hair like honey.”</p>\n<p>Alayne raised her head. “More beautiful than me?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold studied her face. “You are comely enough, I grant you.\nWhen Lady Anya first told me of this match, I was afraid that you might\nlook like your father.”</p>\n<p>“Little pointy beard and all?” Alayne laughed.</p>\n<p>“I never meant… “</p>\n<p>“I hope you joust better than you talk.”</p>\n<p>For a moment he looked shocked. But as the song was ending, he burst\ninto a laugh. “No one told me you were clever.”</p>\n<p>He has good teeth, she thought, straight and white. And when he\nsmiles, he has the nicest dimples. She ran one finger down his cheek.\n“Should we ever wed, you’ll have to send Saffron back to her father.\nI’ll be all the spice you’ll want.”</p>\n<p>He grinned. “I will hold you to that promise, my lady. Until that\nday, may I wear your favor in the tourney?”</p>\n<p>“You may not. It is promised to… another.” She was not sure who as\nyet, but she knew she would find someone.</p>\n","related_posts":["ARIANNE/","MERCY/"],"length":6752,"excerpt":"<h2 id=\"alayne--excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter\">ALAYNE--EXCERPT FROM\nTHE WINDS OF WINTER</h2>\n<p>She was reading her little lord a tale of the Winged Knight when Mya\nStone came knocking on the door of his bedchamber, clad in boots and\nriding leathers and smelling strongly of the stable. Mya had straw in\nher hair and a scowl on her face. That scowl comes of having Mychel\nRedfort near, Alayne knew.</p>\n<p>“Your lordship,” Mya informed Lord Robert, “Lady Waynwood’s banners\nhave been seen an hour down the road. She will be here soon, with your\ncousin Harry. Will you want to greet them?”</p>\n<p>Why did she have to mention Harry? Alayne thought. We will never get\nSweetrobin out of bed now. The boy slapped a pillow. “Send them away. I\nnever asked them here.”","more":"Mya looked nonplussed. No one in\nthe Vale was better at handling a mule, but lordlings were another\nmatter. “They were invited,” she said uncertainly, “for the tourney. I\ndon’t… “</p>\n<p>Alayne closed her book. “Thank you, Mya. Let me talk with Lord\nRobert, if you would.”</p>\n<p>Relief plain on her face, Mya fled without another word.</p>\n<p>“I hate that Harry,” Sweetrobin said when she was gone. “He calls me\ncousin, but he’s just waiting for me to die so he can take the Eyrie. He\nthinks I don’t know, but I do.”</p>\n<p>“Your lordship should not believe such nonsense,” Alayne said. “I’m\nsure Ser Harrold loves you well.” And if the gods are good, he will love\nme too. Her tummy gave a little flutter.</p>\n<p>“He doesn’t,” Lord Robert insisted. “He wants my father’s castle,\nthat’s all, so he pretends.” The boy clutched the blanket to his pimply\nchest. “I don’t want you to marry him, Alayne. I am the Lord of the\nEyrie, and I forbid it.” He sounded as if he were about to cry. “You\nshould marry me instead. We could sleep in the same bed every night, and\nyou could read me stories.”</p>\n<p>No man can wed me so long as my dwarf husband still lives somewhere\nin this world. Queen Cersei had collected the head of a dozen dwarfs,\nPetyr claimed, but none were Tyrion’s. “Sweetrobin, you must not say\nsuch things. You are the Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale, and\nyou must wed a highborn lady and father a son to sit in the High Hall of\nHouse Arryn after you are gone.”</p>\n<p>Robert wiped his nose. “But I want — “</p>\n<p>She put a finger to his lips. “I know what you want, but it cannot\nbe. I am no fit wife for you. I am bastard born.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t care. I love you best of anyone. “</p>\n<p>You are such a little fool. “Your lords bannermen will care. Some\ncall my father upjumped and ambitious. If you were to take me to wife,\nthey would say that he made you do it, that it was no will of yours. The\nLords Declarant might take arms against him once again, and he and I\nshould both be put to death.”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t let them hurt you!” Lord Robert said. “If they try I will\nmake them all fly.” His hand began to tremble.</p>\n<p>Alayne stroked his fingers. “There, my Sweetrobin, be still now.”\nWhen the shaking passed, she said, “You must have a proper wife, a\ntrueborn maid of noble birth.”</p>\n<p>“No. I want to marry you, Alayne.”</p>\n<p>Once your lady mother intended that very thing, but I was trueborn\nthen, and noble. “My lord is kind to say so.” Alayne smoothed his hair.\nLady Lysa had never let the servants touch it, and after she had died\nRobert had suffered terrible shaking fits whenever anyone came near him\nwith a blade, so it had been allowed to grow until it tumbled over his\nround shoulders and halfway down his flabby white chest. He does have\npretty hair. If the gods are good and he lives long enough to wed, his\nwife will admire his hair, surely. That much she will love about him.\n“Any child of ours would be baseborn. Only a trueborn child of House\nArryn can displace Ser Harrold as your heir. My father will find a\nproper wife for you, some highborn girl much prettier than me. You’ll\nhunt and hawk together, and she’ll give you her favor to wear in\ntournaments. Before long, you will have forgotten me entirely.”</p>\n<p>“I won’t!”</p>\n<p>“You will. You must.” Her voice was firm, but gentle.</p>\n<p>“The Lord of the Eyrie can do as he likes. Can’t I still love you,\neven if I have to marry her? Ser Harrold has a common woman. Benjicot\nsays she’s carrying his bastard.”</p>\n<p>Benjicot should learn to keep his fool’s mouth shut. “Is that what\nyou would have from me? A bastard?” She pulled her fingers from his\ngrasp. “Would you dishonor me that way?”</p>\n<p>The boy looked stricken. “No. I never meant — “</p>\n<p>Alayne stood. “If it please my lord, I must go and find my father.\nSomeone needs to greet Lady Waynwood.” Before her little lord could find\nthe words to protest, she gave him a quick curtsy and fled the\nbedchamber, sweeping down the hall and across a covered bridge to the\nLord Protector’s apartments.</p>\n<p>When she had left Petyr Baelish that morning he had been breaking his\nfast with old Oswell who had arrived last night from Gulltown on a\nlathered horse. She hoped they might still be talking, but Petyr’s solar\nproved empty. Someone had left a window open and a stack of papers had\nblown onto the floor. The sun was slanting through the thick yellow\nwindows, and dust motes danced in the light like tiny golden insects.\nThough snow had blanketed the heights of the Giant’s Lance above, below\nthe mountain the autumn lingered and winter wheat was ripening in the\nfields. Outside the window she could hear the laughter of the\nwasherwomen at the well, the din of steel on steel from the ward where\nthe knights were at their drills. Good sounds.</p>\n<p>Alayne loved it here. She felt alive again, for the first since her\nfather… since Lord Eddard Stark had died.</p>\n<p>She closed the window, gathered up the fallen papers, and stacked\nthem on the table. One was a list of the competitors. Four-and-sixty\nknights had been invited to vie for places amongst Lord Robert Arryn’s\nnew Brotherhood of Winged Knights, and four­ and-sixty knights had come\nto tilt for the right to wear falcon’s wings upon their warhelms and\nguard their lord.</p>\n<p>The competitors came from all over the Vale, from the mountain\nvalleys and the coast, from Gulltown and the Bloody Gate, even the Three\nSisters. Though a few were promised, only three were wed; the eight\nvictors would be expected to spend the next three years at Lord Robert’s\nside, as his own personal guard (Alayne had suggested seven, like the\nKingsguard, but Sweetrobin had insisted that he must have more knights\nthan King Tommen), so older men with wives and children had not been\ninvited.</p>\n<p>And they came, Alayne thought proudly. They all came.</p>\n<p>It had fallen out just as Petyr said it would, the day the ravens\nflew. “They’re young, eager, hungry for adventure and renown. Lysa would\nnot let them go to war. This is the next best thing. A chance to serve\ntheir lord and prove their prowess. They will come. Even Harry the\nHeir.” He had smoothed her hair and kissed her forehead. “What a clever\ndaughter you are.”</p>\n<p>It was clever. The tourney, the prizes, the winged knights, it had\nall been her own notion. Lord Robert’s mother had filled him full of\nfears, but he always took courage from the tales she read him of Ser\nArtys Arryn, the Winged Knight of legend, founder of his line. Why not\nsurround him with Winged Knights? She had thought one night, after\nSweetrobin had finally drifted off to sleep. His own Kingsguard, to keep\nhim safe and make him brave. And no sooner did she tell Petyr her idea\nthan he went out and made it happen. He will want to be there to greet\nSer Harrold. Where could he have gone?</p>\n<p>Alayne swept down the tower stairs to enter the pillared gallery at\nthe back of the Great Hall. Below her, serving men were setting up\ntrestle tables for the evening feast, while their wives and daughters\nswept up the old rushes and scattered fresh ones. Lord Nestor was\nshowing Lady Waxley his prize tapestries, with their scenes of hunt and\nchase. The same panels had once hung in the Red Keep of King’s Landing,\nwhen Robert sat the Iron Throne. Joffrey had them taken down and they\nhad languished in some cellar until Petyr Baelish arranged for them to\nbe brought to the Vale as a gift for Nestor Royce. Not only were the\nhangings beautiful, but the High Steward delighted in telling anyone\nwho’d listen that they had once belonged to a king.</p>\n<p>Petyr was not in the Great Hall. Alayne crossed the gallery and\ndescended the stair built into the thick west wall, to come out in the\ninner ward, where the jousting would be held. Viewing stands had raised\nfor all those who had come to watch, with four long tilting barriers in\nbetween. Lord Nestor’s men were painting the barriers with whitewash,\ndraping the stands with bright banners, and hanging shields on the gate\nthe competitors would pass through when they made their entrance.</p>\n<p>At the north end of the yard, three quintains had been set up, and\nsome of the competitors were riding at them. Alayne knew them by their\nshields; the bells of Belmore, green vipers for the Lynderlys, the red\nsledge of Breakstone, House Tollett’s black and grey pily. Ser Mychel\nRedfort set one quintain spinning with a perfectly placed blow. He was\none of those favored to win wings.</p>\n<p>Petyr was not at the quintains, nor anywhere in the yard, but as she\nturned to go a woman’s voice called out. “Alayne!” cried Myranda Royce,\nfrom a carved stone bench beneath a beech tree, where she was seated\nbetween two men. She looked in need of rescue. Smiling, Alayne walked\ntoward her friend.</p>\n<p>Myranda was wearing a grey woolen dress, a green hooded cloak, and a\nrather desperate look. On either side of her sat a knight. The one on\nher right had a grizzled beard, a bald head, and a belly that spilled\nover his swordbelt where his lap should have been. The one on her left\nwas no more than eighteen, and skinny as a spear. His ginger-colored\nwhiskers only partially served to disguise the angry red pimples that\ndotted his face.</p>\n<p>The bald knight wore a dark blue surcoat emblazoned with a huge pair\nof pink lips. The pimply-gingerlad countered with nine white seagulls on\na field of brown, which marked him for a Shett of Gulltown. He was\nstaring so intently at Myranda’s breasts that he hardly noticed Alayne\nuntil Myranda rose to hug her. “Thank you, thank you, thank you ” Randa\nwhispered in her ear, before she turned to say, “Sers, may I present you\nthe Lady Alayne Stone?”</p>\n<p>“The Lord Protector’s daughter,” the bald knight announced, all\nhearty gallantry. He rose ponderously. “And full as lovely as the tales\ntold of her, I see.”</p>\n<p>Not to be outdone, the pimply knight hopped up and said, “Ser Ossifer\nspeaks truly, you are the most beautiful maid in all the Seven\nKingdoms.” It might have been a sweeter courtesy had he not addressed it\nto her chest.</p>\n<p>“And have you seen all those maids yourself, ser?” Alayne asked him.\n“You are young to be so widely travelled.”</p>\n<p>He blushed, which only made his pimples look angrier. “No, my lady. I\nam from Gulltown.”</p>\n<p>And I am not, though Alayne was born there. She would need to be\ncareful around this one. “I remember Gulltown fondly,” she told him,\nwith a smile as vague as it was pleasant. To Myranda she said, “Do you\nknow where my father’s gotten to, perchance?”</p>\n<p>“Let me take you to him, my lady.”</p>\n<p>“I do hope you will forgive me for depriving you of Lady Myranda’s\ncompany,” Alayne told the knights. She did not wait for a reply, but\ntook the older girl arm-in-arm and drew her away from the bench. Only\nwhen they were out of earshot did she whisper, “Do you really know where\nmy father is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not. Walk faster, my new suitors may be following.”\nMyranda made a face. “Ossifer Lipps is the dullest knight in the Vale,\nbut Uther Shett aspires to his laurels. I am praying they fight a duel\nfor my hand, and kill each other.”</p>\n<p>Alayne giggled. “Surely Lord Nestor would not seriously entertain a\nsuit from such men.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, he might. My lord father is annoyed with me for killing my last\nhusband and putting him to all this trouble.”</p>\n<p>“It was not your fault he died.”</p>\n<p>“There was no one else in the bed that I recall.”</p>\n<p>Alayne could not help but shutter. Myranda’s husband had died when he\nwas making love with her. “Those Sistermen who came in yesterday were\ngallant,” she said, to change the subject. “If you don’t like Ser\nOssifer or Ser Uther, marry one of them instead. I thought the youngest\none was very handsome.”</p>\n<p>“The one in the sealskin cloak?” Randa said, incredulous.</p>\n<p>“One of his brothers, then.”</p>\n<p>Myranda rolled her eyes. “They’re from the Sisters. Did you ever know\na Sisterman who could joust? They clean their swords with codfish oil\nand wash in tubs of cold seawater.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Alayne said, “at least they’re clean.”</p>\n<p>“Some of them have webs between their toes. I’d sooner marry Lord\nPetyr. Then I’d be your mother. How little is his finger, I ask\nyou?”</p>\n<p>Alayne did not dignify that question with an answer. “Lady Waynwood\nwill be here soon, with her sons.”</p>\n<p>“Is that a promise or a threat?” Myranda said. “The first Lady\nWaynwood must have been a mare, I think. How else to explain why all the\nWaynwood men are horse-faced? If I were ever to wed a Waynwood, he would\nhave to swear a vow to don his helm whenever he wished to fuck me, and\nkeep the visor closed.” She gave Alayne a pinch on the arm. “My Harry\nwill be with them, though. I notice that you left him out. I shall never\nforgive you for stealing him away from me. He’s the boy I want to\nmarry.”</p>\n<p>“The betrothal was my father’s doing,” Alayne protested, as she had a\nhundred times before. She is only teasing, she told herself… but behind\nthe japes, she could hear the hurt.</p>\n<p>Myranda stopped to gaze across the yard at the knights at their\npractice. “Now there’s the very sort of husband I need.”</p>\n<p>A few feet away, two knights were fighting with blunted practice\nswords. Their blades crashed together twice, then slipped past each\nother only to be blocked by upraised shields, but the bigger man gave\nground at the impact. Alayne could not see the front of his shield from\nwhere she stood, but his attacker bore three ravens in flight, each\nclutching a red heart in its claws. Three hearts and three ravens.</p>\n<p>She knew right then how the fight would end.</p>\n<p>A few moments later and the big man sprawled dazed in the dust with\nhis helm askew. When his squire undid the fastenings to bare his head,\nthere was blood trickling down his scalp. If the swords had not been\nblunted, there would be brains as well. That last head blow had been so\nhard Alayne had winced in sympathy when it fell. Myranda Royce\nconsidered the victor thoughtfully. “Do you think if I asked nicely Ser\nLyn would kill my suitors for me?”</p>\n<p>“He might, for a plump bag of gold.” Ser Lyn Corbray was forever\ndesperately short of coin, all the Vale knew that.</p>\n<p>“Alas, all I have is a plump pair of teats. Though with Ser Lyn, a\nplump sausage under my skirts would serve me better.”</p>\n<p>Alayne’s giggle drew Corbray’s attention. He handed his shield to his\nloutish squire, removed his helm and quilted coif. “Ladies.” His long\nbrown hair was plastered to his brow by sweat.</p>\n<p>“Well struck, Ser Lyn,” Alayne called out. “Though I fear you’ve\nknocked poor Ser Owen insensible.”</p>\n<p>Corbray glanced back to where his foe was being helped from the yard\nby his squire. “He had no sense to start with, or he should not have\ntried me.”</p>\n<p>There is truth in that, Alayne thought, but some demon of mischief\nwas in her that morning, so she gave Ser Lyn a thrust of her own.\nSmiling sweetly, she said, “My lord father tells me your brother’s new\nwife is with child.”</p>\n<p>Corbray gave her a dark look. “Lyonel sends his regrets. He remains\nat Heart’s Home with his peddler’s daughter, watching her belly swell as\nif he were the first man who ever got a wench pregnant.”</p>\n<p>Oh, that’s an open wound, thought Alayne. Lyonel Corbray’s first wife\nhad given him nothing but a frail, sickly babe who died in infancy, and\nduring all those years Ser Lyn had remained his brother’s heir. When the\npoor woman finally died, however, Petyr Baelish had stepped in and\nbrokered a new marriage for Lord Corbray. The second Lady Corbray was\nsixteen, the daughter of a wealthy Gulltown merchant, but she had come\nwith an immense dowry, and men said she was a tall, strapping, healthy\ngirl, with big breasts and good, wide hips. And fertile too, it\nseems.</p>\n<p>“We are all praying that the Mother grants Lady Corbray an easy labor\nand a healthy child,” said Myranda.</p>\n<p>Alayne could not help herself. She smiled and said, “My father is\nalways pleased to be of service to one of Lord Robert’s leal bannermen.\nI’m sure he would be most delighted to help broker a marriage for you as\nwell, Ser Lyn.”</p>\n<p>“How kind of him.” Corbray’s lips drew back in something that might\nhave been meant as a smile, though it gave Alayne a chill. “But what\nneed have I for heirs when I am landless and like to remain so, thanks\nto our Lord Protector? No. Tell your lord father I need none of his\nbrood mares.”</p>\n<p>The venom in his voice was so thick that for a moment she almost\nforgot that Lyn Corbray was actually her father’s catspaw, bought and\npaid for. Or was he? Perhaps, instead of being Petyr’s man pretending to\nbe Petyr’s foe, he was actually his foe pretending to be his man\npretending to be his foe.</p>\n<p>Just thinking about it was enough to make her head spin. Alayne\nturned abruptly from the yard… and bumped into a short, sharp-faced man\nwith a brush of orange hair who had come up behind her. His hand shot\nout and caught her arm before she could fall. “My lady. My pardons if I\ntook you unawares.”</p>\n<p>“The fault was mine. I did not see you standing there.”</p>\n<p>“We mice are quiet creatures.” Ser Shadrich was so short that he\nmight have been taken for a squire, but his face belonged to a much\nolder man. She saw long leagues in the wrinkles at the corner of his\nmouth, old battles in the scar beneath his ear, and a hardness behind\nthe eyes that no boy would ever have. This was a man grown. Even Randa\novertopped him, though.</p>\n<p>“Will you be seeking wings?” the Royce girl said.</p>\n<p>“A mouse with wings would be a silly sight.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps you will try the melee instead?” Alayne suggested. The melee\nwas an afterthought, a sop for all the brothers, uncles, fathers, and\nfriends who had accompanied the competitors to the Gates of the Moon to\nsee them win their silver wings, but there would be prizes for the\nchampions, and a chance to win ransoms.</p>\n<p>“A good melee is all a hedge knight can hope for, unless he stumbles\non a bag of dragons. And that’s not likely, is it?”</p>\n<p>“I suppose not. But now you must excuse us, ser, we need to find my\nlord father. “</p>\n<p>Horns sounded from atop the wall. “Too late,” Myranda said. “They’re\nhere. We shall need to do the honors by ourselves.” She grinned. “Last\none to the gate must marry Uther Shett.”</p>\n<p>They made a race of it, dashing headlong across the yard and past the\nstables, skirts flapping, whilst knights and serving men alike looked\non, and pigs and chickens scattered before them. It was most unladylike,\nbut Alayne sound found herself laughing. For just a little while, as she\nran, she forget who she was, and where, and found herself remembering\nbright cold days at Winterfell, when she would race through Winterfell\nwith her friend Jeyne Poole, with Arya running after them trying to keep\nup.</p>\n<p>By the time they arrived at the gatehouse, both of them were\nred-faced and panting. Myranda had lost her cloak somewhere along the\nway. They were just in time. The portcullis had been raised, and a\ncolumn of riders twenty strong were passing underneath. At their head\nrode Anya Waynwood, Lady of Ironoaks, stern and slim, her grey-brown\nhair bound up in a scarf. Her riding cloak was heavy green wool trimmed\nwith brown fur, and clasped at the throat by a niello brooch in the\nshape of the broken wheel of her House.</p>\n<p>Myranda Royce stepped forward and sketched a curtsy. “Lady Anya.\nWelcome to the Gates of the Moon.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Myranda. Lady Alayne.” Anya Waynwood inclined her head to each\nof them in turn. “It is good of you to greet us. Allow me to present my\ngrandson, Ser Roland Waynwood.” She nodded at the knight who had spoken.\n“And this is my youngest son, Ser Wallace Waynwood. And of course my\nward, Ser Harrold Hardyng.”</p>\n<p>Harry the Heir, Alayne thought. My husband-to-be, if he will have me.\nA sudden terror filled her. She wondered if her face was red. Don’t\nstare at him, she reminded herself, don’t stare, don’t gape, don’t gawk.\nLook away. Her hair must be a frightful mess after all that running. It\ntook all her will to stop herself from trying to tuck the loose strands\nback into place. Never mind your stupid hair. Your hair doesn’t matter.\nIt’s him that matters. Him, and the Waynwoods.</p>\n<p>Ser Roland was the oldest of the three, though no more than\nfive-and-twenty. He was taller and more muscular than Ser Wallace, but\nboth were long-faced and lantern-jawed, with stringy brown hair and\npinched noses. Horsefaced and homely, Alayne thought.</p>\n<p>Harry, though…</p>\n<p>My Harry. My lord, my lover, my betrothed.</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold Hardyng looked every inch a lord-in-waiting; clean-limbed\nand handsome, straight as a lance, hard with muscle. Men old enough to\nhave known Jon Arryn in his youth said Ser Harrold had his look, she\nknew. He had a mop of sandy blond hair, pale blue eyes, an aquiline\nnose. Joffrey was comely too, though, she reminded herself. A comely\nmonster, that’s what he was. Little Lord Tyrion was kinder, twisted\nthough he was.</p>\n<p>Harry was staring at her. He knows who I am, she realized, and he\ndoes not seem pleased to see me. It was only then that she took note of\nhis heraldry. Though his surcoat and horse trappings were patterned in\nthe red-and-white diamonds of House Hardyng, his shield was quartered.\nThe arms of Hardyng and Waynwood were displayed in the first and third\nquarters, respectively, but in the second and fourth quarters he bore\nthe moon-and-falcon of House Arryn, sky blue and cream. Sweetrobin will\nnot like that.</p>\n<p>Ser Wallace said, “Are we the l-l-last?”</p>\n<p>“You are, sers,” replied Myranda Royce, taking absolutely no notice\nof his stammer.</p>\n<p>“Wh-wh-when will the t-t-tilts commence?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, soon, I pray,” said Randa. “Some of the competitors have been\nhere for almost a moon’s turn, partaking of my father’s meat and mead.\nAll good fellows, and very brave… but they do eat rather a lot.”</p>\n<p>The Waynwoods laughed, and even Harry the Heir cracked a thin smile.\n“It was snowing in the passes, else we would have been here sooner,”\nsaid Lady Anya.</p>\n<p>“Had we known such beauty awaited us at the Gates, we would have\nflown,” Ser Roland said. Though his words were addressed to Myranda\nRoyce, he smiled at Alayne as he said them.</p>\n<p>“To fly you would need wings,” Randa replied, “and there are some\nknights here who might have a thing to say concerning that.”</p>\n<p>“I look forward to a spirited discussion.” Ser Roland swung down from\nhis horse, turned to Alayne, and smiled. “I had heard that Lord\nLittlefinger’s daughter was fair of face and full of grace, but no one\never told me that she was a thief.”</p>\n<p>“You wrong me, ser. I am no thief!”</p>\n<p>Ser Roland placed his hand over his heart. “Then how do you explain\nthis hole in my chest, from where you stole my heart?”</p>\n<p>“He is only t-teasing you, my lady,” stammered Ser Wallace. “My\nn-n-nephew never had a h-h-heart.”</p>\n<p>“The Waynwood wheel has a broken spoke, and we have my nuncle here.”\nSer Roland gave Wallace a whap behind the ear. “Squires should be quiet\nwhen knights are speaking.”</p>\n<p>Ser Wallace reddened. “I am no more a s-squire, my lady. My n-nephew\nknows full well that I was k-k-kni-k-k-kni –“</p>\n<p>“Dubbed?” Alayne suggested gently.</p>\n<p>“Dubbed,” said Wallace Waynwood, gratefully.</p>\n<p>Robb would be his age, if he were still alive, she could not help but\nthink, but Robb died a king, and this is just a boy.</p>\n<p>“My lord father has assigned you rooms in the East Tower,” Lady\nMyranda was telling Lady Waynwood, “but I fear your knights will need to\nshare a bed. The Gates of the Moon were never meant to house so many\nnoble visitors.”</p>\n<p>“You are in the Falcon Tower, Ser Harrold,” Alayne put in. Far away\nfrom Sweetrobin. That was intentional, she knew. Petyr Baelish did not\nleave such things to chance. “If it please you, I will show you to your\nchambers myself.” This time her eyes met Harry’s. She smiled just for\nhim, and said a silent prayer to the Maiden. Please, he doesn’t need to\nlove me, just make him like me, just a little, that would be enough for\nnow.</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold looked down at her coldly. “Why should it please me to be\nescorted anywhere by Littlefinger’s bastard?”</p>\n<p>All three Waynwoods looked at him askance. “You are a guest here,\nHarry,” Lady Anya reminded him, in a frosty voice. “See that you\nremember that.”</p>\n<p>A lady’s armor is her courtesy. Alayne could feel the blood rushing\nto her face. No tears, she prayed. Please, please, I must not cry. “As\nyou wish, ser. And now if you will excuse me, Littlefinger’s bastard\nmust find her lord father and let him know that you have come, so we can\nbegin the tourney on the morrow.” And may your horse stumble, Harry the\nHeir, so you fall on your stupid head in your first tilt. She showed the\nWaynwoods a stone face as they blurted out awkward apologies for their\ncompanion. When they were done she turned and fled.</p>\n<p>Near the keep, she ran headlong into Ser Lothor Brune and almost\nknocked him off his feet. “Harry the Heir? Harry the Arse, I say. He’s\njust some upjumped squire.”</p>\n<p>Alayne was so grateful that she hugged him. “Thank you. Have you seen\nmy father, ser?”</p>\n<p>“Down in the vaults, ” Ser Lothar said, “inspecting Lord Nestor’s\ngranaries with Lord Grafton and Lord Belmore.”</p>\n<p>The vaults were large and dark and filthy. Alayne lit a taper and\nclutched her skirt as she made the descent. Near the bottom, she heard\nLord Grafton’s booming voice, and followed.”The merchants are clamoring\nto buy, and the lords are clamoring to sell,” the Gulltowner was saying\nwhen she found them. Though not a tall man, Grafton was wide, with thick\narms and shoulders. His hair was a dirty blond mop. “How am I to stop\nthat, my lord?”</p>\n<p>“Post guardsmen on the docks. If need be, seize the ships. How does\nnot matter, so long as no food leaves the Vale. “</p>\n<p>“These prices, though,” protested fat Lord Belmore,” these prices are\nmore than fair.”</p>\n<p>“You say more than fair, my lord. I say less than we would wish.\nWait. If need be, buy the food yourself and keep it stored. Winter is\ncoming. Prices must go higher.”</p>\n<p>“Perhaps,” said Belmore, doubtfully.</p>\n<p>“Bronze Yohn will not wait, ” Grafton complained. “He need not ship\nthrough Gulltown, he has his own ports. Whilst we are hoarding our\nharvest, Royce and the other Lords Declarant will turn theirs into\nsilver, you may be sure of that.”</p>\n<p>“Let us hope so,” said Petyr. “When their granaries are empty, they\nwill need every scrap of that silver to buy sustenance from us. And now\nif you will excuse me, my lord, it would seem my daughter has need of\nme.”</p>\n<p>“Lady Alayne,” Lord Grafton said. “You look bright-eyed this\nmorning.”</p>\n<p>“You are kind to say so, my lord. Father, I am sorry to disturb you,\nbut I thought you would want to know that the Waynwoods have\narrived.”</p>\n<p>“And is Ser Harrold with them?”</p>\n<p>Horrible Ser Harrold. “ He is.”</p>\n<p>Lord Belmore laughed. “I never thought Royce would let him come. Is\nhe blind, or merely stupid?”</p>\n<p>“He is honorable. Sometimes it amounts to the same thing. If he\ndenied the lad the chance to prove himself, it could create a rift\nbetween them, so why not let him tilt? The boy is nowise skilled enough\nto win a place amongst the Winged Knights.”</p>\n<p>“I suppose not,” said Belmore, grudgingly. Lord Grafton kissed Alayne\non the hand, and the two lords went off, leaving her alone with her lord\nfather.</p>\n<p>“Come,” Petyr said, “walk with me.” He took her by the arm and led\nher deeper into the vaults, past an empty dungeon. “And how was your\nfirst meeting with Harry the Heir?”</p>\n<p>“He’s horrible.”</p>\n<p>“The world is full of horrors, sweet. By now you ought to know that.\nYou’ve seen enough of them.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said, “but why must he be so cruel? He called me your\nbastard. Right in the yard, in front of everyone.”</p>\n<p>“So far as he knows, that’s who you are. This betrothal was never his\nidea, and Bronze Yohn has no doubt warned him against my wiles. You are\nmy daughter. He does not trust you, and he believes that you’re beneath\nhim.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I’m not. He may think he’s some great knight, but Ser Lothor\nsays he’s just some upjumped squire.”</p>\n<p>Petyr put his arm around her. “So he is, but he is Robert’s heir as\nwell. Bringing Harry here was the first step in our plan, but now we\nneed to keep him, and only you can do that. He has a weakness for a\npretty face, and whose face is prettier than yours? Charm him. Entrance\nhim. Bewitch him.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know how,” she said miserably.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I think you do,” said Littlefinger, with one of those smiles\nthat did not reach his eyes. “You will be the most beautiful woman in\nthe hall tonight, as lovely as your lady mother at your age. I cannot\nseat you on the dais, but you’ll have a place of honor above the salt\nand underneath a wall sconce. The fire will be shining in your hair, so\neveryone will see how fair of face you are. Keep a good long spoon on\nhand to beat the squires off, sweetling. You will not want green boys\nunderfoot when the knights come round to beg you for your favor.”</p>\n<p>“Who would ask to wear a bastard’s favor?”</p>\n<p>“Harry, if he has the wits the gods gave a goose… but do not give it\nto him. Choose some other gallant, and favor him instead. You do not\nwant to seem too eager.”</p>\n<p>“No,” Alayne said.</p>\n<p>“Lady Waynwood will insist that Harry dance with you, I can promise\nyou that much. That will be your chance. Smile at the boy. Touch him\nwhen you speak. Tease him, to pique his pride. If he seems to be\nresponding, tell him that you are feeling faint, and ask him to take you\noutside for a breath of fresh air. No knight could refuse such a request\nfrom a fair maiden.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” she said, “but he thinks that I’m a bastard.”</p>\n<p>“A beautiful bastard, and the Lord Protector’s daughter.” Petyr drew\nher close and kissed her on both cheeks. “The night belongs to you,\nsweetling, Remember that, always.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll try, father,” she said.</p>\n<p>The feast proved to be everything her father promised.</p>\n<p>Sixty-four dishes were served, in honor of the sixty-four competitors\nwho had come so far to contest for silver wings before their lord. From\nthe rivers and the lakes came pike and trout and salmon, from the seas\ncrabs and cod and herring. Ducks there were, and capons, peacocks in\ntheir plumage and swans in almond milk. Suckling pigs were served up\ncrackling with apples in their mouths, and three huge aurochs were\nroasted whole above firepits in the castle yard, since they were too big\nto get through the kitchen doors. Loaves of hot bread filled the trestle\ntables in Lord Nestor’s hall, and massive wheels of cheese were brought\nup from the vaults. The butter was fresh-churned, and there were leeks\nand carrots, roasted onions, beets, turnips, parsnips. And best of all,\nLord Nestor’s cooks prepared a splendid subtlety, a lemon cake in the\nshape of the Giant’s Lance, twelve feet tall and adorned with an Eyrie\nmade of sugar.</p>\n<p>For me, Alayne thought, as they wheeled it out. Sweetrobin loved\nlemon cakes too, but only after she told him that they were her\nfavorites. The cake had required every lemon in the Vale, but Petyr had\npromised that he would send to Dorne for more.</p>\n<p>There were gifts as well, splendid gifts. Each of the competitors\nreceived a cloak of cloth-of-silver and a lapis brooch in the shape of a\npair of falcon’s wings. Fine steel daggers were given to the brothers,\nfathers, and friends who had come to watch them tilt. For their mothers,\nsisters, and ladies fair there were bolts of silk and Myrish lace.</p>\n<p>“Lord Nestor has an open hand,” Alayne heard Ser Edmund Breakstone\nsay. “An open hand and a little finger,” Lady Waynwood replied, with a\nnod toward Petyr Baelish. Breakstone was not slow to take her meaning.\nThe true source of this largesse was not Lord Nestor, but the Lord\nProtector.</p>\n<p>When the last course had been served and cleared, the tables were\nlifted from their trestles to clear the floor for dancing, and musicians\nwere brought in.</p>\n<p>“Are there no singers?” asked Ben Coldwater.</p>\n<p>“The little lord cannot abide them,” Ser Lymond Lynderly replied.\n“Not since Marillion.”</p>\n<p>“Ah… that was the man who murdered Lady Lysa, yes?”</p>\n<p>Alayne spoke up. “His singing pleased her greatly, and she showed him\ntoo much favor, perhaps. When she wed my father he went mad and pushed\nher out the Moon Door. Lord Robert has hated singing ever since. He is\nstill fond of music, though.”</p>\n<p>“As am I,” Coldwater said. Rising, he offered Alayne his hand. “Would\nyou honor me with this dance, my lady?”</p>\n<p>“You’re very kind,” she said, as he led her to the floor.</p>\n<p>He was her first partner of the evening, but far from the last. Just\nas Petyr had promised, the young knights flocked around her, vying for\nher favor. After Ben came Andrew Tollett, handsome Ser Byron, red-nosed\nSer Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich the Mad Mouse. Then Ser Albar Royce,\nMyranda’s stout dull brother and Lord Nestor’s heir. She danced with all\nthree Sunderlands, none of whom had webs between their fingers, though\nshe could not vouch for their toes. Uther Shett appeared to pay her\nslimy compliments as he trod upon her feet, but Ser Targon the Halfwild\nproved to be the soul of courtesy. After that Ser Roland Waynwood swept\nher up and made her laugh with mocking comments about half the other\nknights in the hall. His uncle Wallace took a turn as well and tried to\ndo the same, but the words would not come. Alayne finally took pity on\nhim and began to chatter happily, to spare him the embarrassment. When\nthe dance was done she excused herself, and went back to her place to\nhave a drink of wine.</p>\n<p>And there he stood, Harry the Heir himself; tall, handsome, scowling.\n“Lady Alayne. May I partner you in this dance?”</p>\n<p>She considered for a moment. “No. I don’t think so.”</p>\n<p>Color rose to his cheeks. “I was unforgiveably rude to you in the\nyard. You must forgive me.”</p>\n<p>“Must?” She tossed her hair, took a sip of wine, made him wait. “How\ncan you forgive someone who is unforgiveably rude? Will you explain that\nto me, ser?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold looked confused. “Please. One dance.”</p>\n<p>Charm him. Entrance him. Bewitch him. “If you insist.”</p>\n<p>He nodded, offered his arm, led her out onto the floor. As they\nwaited for the music to resume, Alayne glanced at the dais, where Lord\nRobert sat staring at them. Please, she prayed, don’t let him start to\ntwitch and shake. Not here. Not now. Maester Coleman would have made\ncertain that he drank a strong dose of sweetmilk before the feast, but\neven so.</p>\n<p>Then the musicians took up a tune, and she was dancing.</p>\n<p>Say something, she urged herself. You will never make Ser Harry love\nyou if you don’t have the courage to talk him. Should she tell him what\na good dancer he was? No, he’s probably heard that a dozen times\ntonight. Besides, Petyr said that I should not seem eager. Instead she\nsaid, “I have heard that you are about to be a father.” It was not\nsomething most girls would say to their almost-betrothed, but she wanted\nto see if Ser Harrold would lie.</p>\n<p>“For the second time. My daughter Alys is two years old.”</p>\n<p>Your bastard daughter Alys, Alayne thought, but what she said was,\n“That one had a different mother, though.”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Cissy was a pretty thing when I tumbled her, but childbirth\nleft her as fat as a cow, so Lady Anya arranged for her to marry one of\nher men-at-arms. It is different with Saffron.”</p>\n<p>“Saffron?” Alayne tried not to laugh. “Truly?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold had the grace to blush. “Her father says she is more\nprecious to him than gold. He’s rich, the richest man in Gulltown. A\nfortune in spices.”</p>\n<p>“What will you name the babe?” she asked. “Cinnamon if she’s a girl?\nCloves if he’s a boy?”</p>\n<p>That almost made him stumble. “My lady japes.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, no.” Petyr will howl when I tell him what I said.</p>\n<p>“Saffron is very beautiful, I’ll have you know. Tall and slim, with\nbig brown eyes and hair like honey.”</p>\n<p>Alayne raised her head. “More beautiful than me?”</p>\n<p>Ser Harrold studied her face. “You are comely enough, I grant you.\nWhen Lady Anya first told me of this match, I was afraid that you might\nlook like your father.”</p>\n<p>“Little pointy beard and all?” Alayne laughed.</p>\n<p>“I never meant… “</p>\n<p>“I hope you joust better than you talk.”</p>\n<p>For a moment he looked shocked. But as the song was ending, he burst\ninto a laugh. “No one told me you were clever.”</p>\n<p>He has good teeth, she thought, straight and white. And when he\nsmiles, he has the nicest dimples. She ran one finger down his cheek.\n“Should we ever wed, you’ll have to send Saffron back to her father.\nI’ll be all the spice you’ll want.”</p>\n<p>He grinned. “I will hold you to that promise, my lady. Until that\nday, may I wear your favor in the tourney?”</p>\n<p>“You may not. It is promised to… another.” She was not sure who as\nyet, but she knew she would find someone.</p>"},{"title":"一个小故事","comments":0,"date":"2018-02-27T09:42:40.000Z","_content":"曾经看过这么一个故事。\n<!--more-->\n第一天，男孩儿对女孩儿说，我喜欢你。女孩没有表示什么，远远地走开了。\n第二天，男孩儿对女孩儿说，我喜欢你。女孩说，先请我吃一次我喜欢的那家餐厅吧。\n第三天，男孩儿对女孩儿说，我喜欢你。女孩依然没有答应他，但是她对男孩儿说带我去一次我最喜欢的那个地方吧。\n第四天，男孩儿对女孩儿说，你到底什么时候才会答应做我女朋友。女孩儿低头不语，默默走开了。\n第五天，男孩儿生气地问女孩儿，你到底答不答应做我的女朋友。女孩儿说，明天去我们第一次见面的地方，我告诉你答案。\n第六天，女孩儿早早地来了，可是男孩儿晚了三个小时才到。男孩儿面带愠色地说，怎么样，想好了没。女孩儿说还是不要了吧。然后男孩儿气呼呼地转身离开了，并说了一句，浪费时间。女孩儿默默地丢掉了三天前精心挑选的礼物，擦了擦眼泪，然后回家去了。\n第七天，男孩儿去寻找新的目标了。女孩儿的生活一切照常。\n","source":"_posts/2018-02-27.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

ARIANNEE\\--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\n\nThey struck out north by northwest, across drylands and parched plains and pale sands toward Ghost Hill, the stronghold of House Toland, where the ship that would take them across the Sea of Dorne awaited them.  \"Send a raven whenever you have news,\" Prince Doran told her, \"but report only what you know to be true.  We are lost in fog here, besieged by rumors, falsehoods, and traveler’s tales.  I dare not act until I know for a certainty what is happening.\"\n\nWar is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be spared.  \"Doom and death are coming,\" Ellaria Sand had warned them, before she took her own leave from Prince Doran.  \"It is time for my little snakes to scatter, the better to survive the carnage.\"  Ellaria was returning to her father’s seat at Hellholt.  With her went her daughter Loreza, who had just turned seven.  Dorea remained at the Water Gardens, one child amongst a hundred.Obella was to be dispatched to Sunspear, to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of the castellan, Manfrey Martell.\n<!-- more -->\nAnd Elia Sand, oldest of the four girls that Prince Oberyn had fathered on Ellaria, would cross the Sea of Dorne with Arianne.  \"As a lady, not a lance,\" her mother said firmly, but like all the Sand Snakes, Elia had her own mind.\n\nThey crossed the sands in two long days and the better part of two nights, stopping thrice to change their horses.  It was a lonely time for Arianne, surrounded by so many strangers.  Elia was her cousin, but half a child, and Daemon Sand… things had never been the same between her and the Bastard of Godsgrace after her father refused his offer for her hand.  He was a boy then, and bastard born, no fit consort for a princess of Dorne, he should have known better.  And it was my father’s will, not mine.  The rest of her companions she hardly knew at all.    \n\nArianne missed her friends.  Drey and Garin and her sweet Spotted Slyva had been a part of her since she was little, trusted confidants who had shared her dreams and secrets, cheered her when she was sad, helped her face her fears.  One of them had betrayed her, but she missed them all the same.  It was my own fault.  Arianne had made them part of her plot to steal off with Myrcella Baratheon and crown her queen, an act of rebellion meant to force her father’s hand, but someone’s loose tongue had undone her.  The clumsy conspiracy had accomplished nothing, except to cost poor Myrcella part of her face, and Ser Arys Oakheart his life.\n\nArianne missed Ser Arys too, more than she ever would have thought.  He loved me madly, she told herself, yet I was never more than fond of him.  I made use of him in mybed and in my plot, took his love and took his honor, gave him nothing but my body.  In the end he could not live with what we’d done.  Why else would her white knight have charged right into Areo Hotah’s longaxe, to die the way he did?  I was a foolish willful girl, playing at the game of thrones like a drunkard rolling dice.  \n\nThe cost of her folly had been dear.  Drey had been sent across the world to Norvos, Garin exiled to Tyrosh for two years, her sweet silly smiling Slyva married off to Eldon Estermont, a man old enough to be her grandsire.  Ser Arys had paid with his life’s blood, Myrcella with an ear.  \n\nOnly Ser Gerold Dayne had escaped unscathed.  Darkstar.  If Myrcella’s horse had not shied at the last instant, his longsword would have opened her from chest to waist instead just taking off her ear.  Dayne was her most grievous sin, the one that Arianne most regretted.  With one stroke of his sword, he had changed her botched plot into something foul and bloody.  If the gods were good, by now Obara Sand had treed him in his mountain fastness and put an end to him.\n\nShe said as much to Daemon Sand that first night, as they made camp.  \"Be careful what you pray for, princess,\" he replied.  \"Darkstar could put an end to Lady Obara just as easily.\"\n\n\"She has Areo Hotah with her.\"  Prince Doran’s captain of guards had dispatched Ser Arys Oakheart with a single blow, though the Kingsguard were supposed to be the finest knights in all the realm.  \"No man can stand against Hotah.\"\n\n\"Is that what Darkstar is?  A man?\"  Ser Daemon grimaced.  \"A man would not have done what he did to Princess Myrcella.  Ser Gerold is more a viper than your uncle ever was.  Prince Oberyn could see that he was poison, he said so more than once.  It’s just a pity that he never got around to killing him.\"\n\nPoison, thought Arianne.  Yes.  Pretty poison, though.  That was how he’d fooled her.  Gerold Dayne was hard and cruel, but so fair to look upon that the princess had not believed half the tales she’d heard of him.  Pretty boys had ever been her weakness, particularly the ones who were dark and dangerous as well.  That was before, when I was just a girl, she told herself.  I am a woman now, my father’s daughter.  I have learned that lesson.\n\nCome break of day, they were off again.  Elia Sand led the way, her black braid flying behind her as she raced across the dry, cracked plains and up into the hills.  The girl was mad for horses, which might be why she often smelled like one, to the despair of her mother.  Sometimes Arianne felt sorry for Ellaria.  Four girls, and every one of them her father’s daughter.  \n\nThe rest of the party kept a more sedate pace.  The princess found herself riding beside Ser Daemon, remembering other rides when they were younger, rides that often ended in embraces.  When she found herself stealing glances at him, tall and gallant in the saddle, Arianne reminded herself that she was heir to Dorne, and him no more than her shield.  \"Tell me what you know of this Jon Connington,\" she commanded.\n\n\"He’s dead,\" said Daemon Sand.  \"He died in the Disputed Lands.  Of drink, I’ve heard it said.\"      \n\n\"So a dead drunk leads this army?\"\n\n\"Perhaps this Jon Connington is a son of that one.  Or just some clever sellsword who has taken on a dead man’s name.\"\n\n\"Or he never died at all.\"  Could Connington have been pretending to be dead for all these years?  That would require patience worthy of her father.  The thought made Arianne uneasy.  Treating with a man that subtle could be perilous.  \"What was he like before he… before he died?\"\n\n\"I was a boy at Godsgrace when he was sent into exile.  I never knew the man.\"\n\n\"Then tell me what you’ve heard of him from others.\"\n\n\"As my princess commands.  Connington was Lord of Griffin’s Roost when Griffin’s Roost was still a lordship worth the having.  Prince Rhaegar’s squire, or one of them.  Later Prince Rhaegar’s friend and companion.  The Mad King named him Hand during Robert’s Rebellion, but he was defeated at Stoney Sept in the Battle of the Bells, and Robert slipped away.  King Aerys was wroth, and sent Connington into exile.  There he died.\"\n\n\"Or not.\"  Prince Doran had told her all of that.  There must be more.  \"Those are just the things he did.  I know all that.  What sort of man was he?  Honest and honorable, venal and grasping, proud?\"\n\n\"Proud, for a certainty.  Even arrogant.  A faithful friend to Rhaegar, but prickly with others.  Robert was his liege, but I’ve heard it said that Connington chafed at serving such a lord.  Even then, Robert was known to be fond of wine and whores.\"\n\n\"No whores for Lord Jon, then?\"\n\n\"I could not say.  Some men keep their whoring secret.\"\n\n\"Did he have a wife?  A paramour?\"\n\nSer Daemon shrugged.  \"Not that I have ever heard.\"\n\nThat was troubling too.  Ser Arys Oakheart had broken his vows for her, but it did not sound as if Jon Connington could be similarly swayed.  Can I match such a man with words alone?\n\nThe princess lapsed into silence, all the while pondering what she would find at journey’s end.  That night when they made camp, she crept into the tent she shared with Jayne Ladybright and Elia Sand and slipped the bit of parchment out of her sleeve to read the words again.\n\n>*To Prince Doran of House Martell,*  \n{% centerquote %}\nYou will remember me, I pray.I knew your sister well,and was a leal servant of your good-brother.I grieve for them as you do.I did not die, no more than did your sister’s son.To save his life we kept him hidden,but the time for hiding is done.  A dragon has returned to Westeros to claim his birthright and seek vengeance for his father, and for the princess Elia, his mother.In her name I turn to Dorne.Do not forsake us.{% endcenterquote %}\n>Jon Connington  \n>Lord of Griffin’s Roost  \n>Hand of the True King\n\n\nArianne read the letter thrice, then rolled it up and tucked it back into her sleeve.  A dragon has returned to Westeros, but not the dragon my father was expecting.  Nowhere in the words was there a mention of Daenerys Stormborn… nor of Prince Quentyn, her brother, who had been sent to seek the dragon queen.  The princess remembered how her father had pressed the onyx cyvasse piece into her palm, his voice hoarse and low as he confessed his plan.  A long and perilous voyage, with an uncertain welcome at its end, he had said.  He has gone to bring us back our heart’s desire.  Vengeance.  Justice.  Fire and blood.\n\nFire and blood was what Jon Connington (if indeed it was him) was offering as well.  Or was it?  \"He comes with sellswords, but no dragons,\" Prince Doran had told her, the night the raven came.  \"The Golden Company is the best and largest of the free companies, but ten thousand mercenaries cannot hope to win the Seven Kingdoms.  Elia’s son… I would weep for joy if some part of my sister had survived, but what proof do we have that this is Aegon?\"  His voice broke when he said that.  \"Where are the dragons?\" he asked.  \"Where is Daenerys?\" and Arianne knew that he was really saying, \"Where is my son?\"\n\nIn the Boneway and the Prince’s Pass, two Dornish hosts had massed, and there they sat, sharpening their spears, polishing their armor, dicing, drinking, quarreling, their numbers dwindling by the day, waiting, waiting, waiting for the Prince of Dorne to loose them on the enemies of House Martell.  Waiting for the dragons.  For fire and blood.  For me.  One word from Arianne and those armies would march… so long as that word wasdragon.  If instead the word she sent was war, Lord Yronwood and Lord Fowler and their armies would remain in place.  The Prince of Dorne was nothing if not subtle; here warmeant wait.  \n\nAt mid-morning on the third day Ghost Hill loomed up before them, its chalk-white walls shining against the deep blue of the Sea of Dorne.  From the square towers at the castle’s corners flew the banners of House Toland; a green dragon biting its own tail, upon a golden field.  The sun-and-spear of House Martell streamed atop the great central keep, gold and red and orange, defiant.\n\nRavens had flown ahead to warn Lady Toland of their coming, so the castle gates were open, and Nymella’s eldest daughter rode forth with her steward to meet them near the bottom of the hill.  Tall and fierce, with a blaze of bright red hair tumbling about her shoulders, Valena Toland greeted Arianne with a shout of, \"Come at last, have you?  How slow are those horses?\"\n\n\"Swift enough to outrun yours to the castle gates.\"    \n\n\"We will see about that.\"  Valena wheeled her big red around and put her heels into him, and the race was on, through the dusty lanes of the village at the bottom of the hill, as chickens and villagers alike scrambled out of their path.  Arianne was three horse lengths behind by the time she got her mare up to a gallop, but had closed to one halfway up the slope.  The two of them were side-by-side as they thundered towards the gatehouse, but five yards from the gates Elia Sand came flying from the cloud of dust behind them to rush past both of them on her black filly.\n\n\"Are you half horse, child?\" Valena asked, laughing, in the yard.  \"Princess, did you bring a stable girl?\"\n\n\"I’m Elia,\" the girl announced.  \"Lady Lance.\"\n\nWhoever hung that name on her has much to answer for.  Like as not it had been Prince Oberyn, though, and the Red Viper had never answered to anyone but himself.\n\n\"The girl jouster,\" Valena said.  \"Yes, I’ve heard of you.  Since you were the first to the yard, you’ve won the honor of watering and bridling the horses.\"\n\n\"And after that find the bath house,\" said Princess Arianne.  Elia was chalk and dust from heels to hair.  \n\nThat night Arianne and her knights supped with Lady Nymella and her daughters in the great hall of the castle.  Teora, the younger girl, had the same red hair as her sister, but elsewise could not have been more different.  Short, plump, and so shy she might have passed for a mute, she displayed more interest in the spiced beef and honeyed duck than in the comely young knights at the table, and seemed content to let her lady mother and her sister speak for House Toland.  \n\n\"We have heard the same tales here that you have heard at Sunspear,\" Lady Nymella told them as her serving man poured the wine.  \"Sellswords landing on Cape Wrath, castles under siege or being taken, crops seized or burned.  Where these men come from and who they are, no one is certain.\"\n\n\"Pirates and adventurers, we heard at first,\" said Valena.  \"Then it was supposed to be the Golden Company.  Now it’s said to be Jon Connington, the Mad King’s Hand, come back from the grave to reclaim his birthright.  Whoever it is, Griffin’s Roost has fallen to them.  Rain House, Crow’s Nest, Mistwood, even Greenstone on its island.  All taken.\"\n\nArianne’s thoughts went at once to her sweet Spotted Slyva.  \"Who would want Greenstone?  Was there a battle?\"\n\n\"Not as we have heard, but all the tales are garbled.\"\n\n\"Tarth has fallen too, some fisherfolk will tell you,\" said Valena.  \"These sellswords now hold most of Cape Wrath and half the Stepstones.  We hear talk of elephants in the rainwood.\"\n\n\"Elephants?\"  Arianne did not know what to think of that.  \"Are you certain?  Not dragons?\"\n\n\"Elephants,\" Lady Nymella said firmly.\n\n\"And krakens off the Broken Arm, pulling under crippled galleys,\" said Valena.  \"The blood draws them to the surface, our maester claims.  There are bodies in the water.  A few have washed up on our shores.  And that’s not half of it.  A new pirate king has set up on Torturer’s Deep.  The Lord of the Waters, he styles himself.  This one has real warships, three-deckers, monstrous large.  You were wise not to come by sea.  Since the Redwyne fleet passed through the Stepstones, those waters are crawling with strange sails, all the way north to the Straights of Tarth and Shipbreaker’s Bay.  Myrmen, Volantenes, Lyseni, even reavers from the Iron Islands.  Some have entered the Sea of Dorne to land men on the south shore of Cape Wrath.  We found a good fast ship for you, as your father commanded, but even so… be careful.\"\n\nIt is true, then.  Arianne wanted to ask after her brother, but her father had urged her to watch every word.  If these ships had not brought Quentyn home again with his dragon queen, best not to mention him.  Only her father and a few of his most trusted men knew about her brother’s mission to Slaver’s Bay.  Lady Toland and her daughters were not amongst them.  If it were Quentyn, he would have brought Daenerys back to Dorne, surely.  Why would he risk a landing on Cape Wrath, amongst the stormlords?  \n\n\"Is Dorne at risk?\" Lady Nymella asked.  \"I confess, each time I see a strange sail my heart leaps to my throat.  What if these ships turn south?  The best part of the Toland strength is with Lord Yronwood in the Boneway.  Who will defend Ghost Hill if these strangers land upon our shores?  Should I call my men home?\"\n\n\"Your men are needed where they are, my lady,\" Daemon Sand assured her.  Arianne was quick to nod.  Any other counsel could well lead to Lord Yronwood’s host unravelling like an old tapestry as each man rushed home to defend his own lands against supposed enemies who might or might not ever come.  \"Once we know beyond a doubt whether these be friends or foes, my father will know what to do,\" the princess said.\n\nIt was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the creamcakes on her plate.  \"It is dragons.\"      \n\n\"Dragons?\"  said her mother.  \"Teora, don’t be mad.\"\n\n\"I’m not.  They’re coming.\"\n\n\"How could you possibly know that?\" her sister asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.\n\n\"One of your little dreams?\"\n\nTeora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling.  \"They were dancing.  In my dream.  And everywhere the dragons danced the people died.\"\n\n\"Seven save us.\"  Lady Nymella gave an exasperated sigh.\n\n\"If you did not eat so many creamcakes you would not have such dreams.  Rich foods are not for girls your age, when your humors are so unbalanced.  Maester Toman says — \"\n\n\"I hate Maester Toman,\" Teora said.  Then she bolted from the table, leaving her lady mother to make apologies for her.\n\n\"Be gentle with her, my lady,\" Arianne said.  \"I remember when I was her age.  My father despaired of me, I’m sure.\"  \n\n\"I can attest to that.\"  Ser Daemon took a sip of wine and said, \"House Toland has a dragon on its banners.\"  \n\n\"A dragon eating its own tail, aye,\" Valena said.  \"From the days of Aegon’s Conquest.  He did not conquer here.  Elsewhere he burned his foes, him and his sisters, but here we melted away before them, leaving only stone and sand for them to burn.  And round and round the dragons went, snapping at their tails for want of any other food, till they were tied in knots.\"\n\n\"Our forebears played their part in that,\" Lady Nymella said proudly.  \"Bold deeds were done, and brave men died.  All of it was written down by the maesters who served us.  We have books, if my princess would like to know more.\"\n\n\"Some other time, perhaps,\" said Arianne.\n\nAs Ghost Hill slept that night, the princess donned a hooded cloak against the chill and and walked the castle battlements to clear her thoughts.  Daemon Sand found her leaning on a parapet and gazing out to sea, where the moon was dancing on the water.  \"Princess,\" he said.  \"You ought to be abed.\"\n\n\"I could say the same of you.\"  Arianne turned to gaze upon his face.  A good face, she decided.  The boy I knew has become a handsome man.  His eyes were as blue as a desert sky, his hair the light brown of the sands they had just crossed.  A close-cropped beard followed the thin of a strong jaw, but could not quite hide the dimples when he smiled.  I always loved his smile.\n\nThe Bastard of Godsgrace was one of Dorne’s finest swords as well, as might be expected from one who had been Prince Oberyn’s squire and had received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself.  Some said that he had been her uncle’s lover too, though seldom to his face.  Arianne did not know the truth of that.  He had been her lover, though.  At fourteen she had given him her maidenhead.  Daemon had not been much older, so their couplings had been as clumsy as they were ardent.  Still, it had been sweet.  \n\nArianne gave him her most seductive smile.  \"We might share a bed together.\"\n\nSer Daemon’s face was stone.  \"Have you forgotten, princess?  I am bastard born.\"  He took her hand in his.  \"If I am unworthy of this hand, how can I be worthy of your cunt?\"\n\nShe snatched her hand away.  \"You deserve a slap for that.\"  \n\n\"My face is yours.  Do what you will.\"\n\n\"What I will you will not, it seems.  So be it.  Talk with me instead.  Could this truly be Prince Aegon?\"\n\n\"Gregor Clegane ripped Aegon out of Elia’s arms and smashed his head against a wall,\" Ser Daemon said.  \"If Lord Connington’s prince has a crushed skull, I will believe that Aegon Targaryen has returned from the grave.  Elsewise, no.  This is some feigned boy, no more.  A sellsword’s ploy to win support.\"\n\nMy father fears the same.  \"If not, though… if this truly is Jon Connington, if the boy is Rhaegar’s son… \"\n\n\"Are you hoping that he is, or that he’s not?\"\n\n\"I… it would give great joy to my father if Elia’s son were still alive.  He loved his sister well.\"\n\n\"It was you I asked about, not your father.\"\n\nSo it was.  \"I was seven when Elia died.  They say I held her daughter Rhaenys once, when I was too young to remember.  Aegon will be a stranger to me, whether true or false.\"  The princess paused.  \"We looked for Rhaegar’s sister, not his son.\"  Her father had confided in Ser Daemon when he chose him as his daughter’s shield; with him at least she could speak freely.  \"I would sooner it were Quentyn who’d returned.\"\n\n\"Or so you say,\" said Daemon Sand.  \"Good night, princess.\"  He bowed to her, and left her standing there.\n\nWhat did he mean by that?  Arianne watched him walk away.  What sort of sister would I be, if I did not want my brother back?  It was true, she had resented Quentyn for all those years that she had thought their father meant to name him as his heir in place of her, but that had turned out to be just a misunderstanding.  She was the heir to Dorne, she had her father’s word on that.  Quentyn would have his dragon queen, Daenerys.\n\nIn Sunspear hung a portrait of the Princess Daenerys who had come to Dorne to marry one of Arianne’s forebears.  In her younger days Arianne had spent hours gazing at it, back when she was just a pudgy flat-chested girl on the cusp of maidenhood who prayed every night for the gods to make her pretty.  A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace.  Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort.King Quentyn.  Why did that sound so silly?  \n\nAlmost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.  Her brother was an earnest boy,well-behaved and dutiful, but dull.  And plain, so plain.  The gods had given Arianne the beauty she had prayed for, but Quentyn must have prayed for something else.  His head was overlarge and sort of square, his hair the color of dried mud.  His shoulders slumped as well, and he was too thick about the middle.  He looks too much like Father.\n\n\"I love my brother,\" said Arianne, though only the moon could hear her.  Though if truth be told, she scarcely knew him.  Quentyn had been fostered by Lord Anders of House Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, the son of Lord Ormond Yronwood and grandson of Lord Edgar.  In his youth her uncle Oberyn had fought a duel with Edgar, had given him a wound that mortified and killed him.  Afterward men called him ‘the Red Viper,’ and spoke of poison on his blade.  The Yronwoods were an ancient house, proud and powerful.  Before the coming of the Rhoynar they had been kings over half of Dorne, with domains that dwarfed those of House Martell.  Blood feud and rebellion would surely have followed Lord Edgar’s death, had not her father acted at once.  The Red Viper went to Oldtown, thence across to the narrow sea to Lys, though none dared call it exile.  And in due time, Quentyn was given to Lord Anders to foster as a sign of trust.  That helped to heal the breach between Sunspear and the Yronwoods, but it had opened new ones between Quentyn and the Sand Snakes… and Arianne had always been closer to her cousins than to her distant brother.\n\n\"We are still the same blood, though,\" she whispered.  \"Of course I want my brother home.  I do.\"  The wind off the sea was raising gooseprickles all up and down her arms.  Arianne pulled her cloak about herself, and went off to seek her bed.\n\nTheir ship was called the Peregrine.  They sailed upon the morning tide.  The gods were good to them, the sea calm.  Even with good winds, the crossing took a day and a night.  Jayne Ladybright grew greensick and spent most of the voyage spewing, which Elia Sand seemed to find hilarious.  \"Someone needs to spank that child,\" Joss Hood was heard to say… but Elia was amongst those who heard him say it.\n\n\"I am almost a woman grown, ser,\" she responded haughtily.  \"I’ll let you spank me, though…  but first you’ll need to tilt with me, and knock me off my horse.\"\n\n\"We are on a ship, and without horses,\" Joss replied.\n\n\"And ladies do not joust,\" insisted Ser Garibald Shells, a far more serious and proper young man than his companion.\n\n\"I do.  I’m Lady Lance.\"\n\nArianne had heard enough.  \"You may be a lance, but you are no lady.  Go below and stay there till we reach land.\"\n\nElsewise the crossing was uneventful.  At dusk they spied a galley in the distance, her oars rising and falling against the evening stars, but she was moving away from them, and soon dwindled and was gone.  Arianne played a game of cyvasse with Ser Daemon, and another one with Garibald Shells, and somehow managed to lose both.  Ser Garibald was kind enough to say that she played a gallant game, but Daemon mocked her.  \"You have other pieces beside the dragon, princess.  Try moving them sometime.\"\n\n\"I like the dragon.\"  She wanted to slap the smile off his face.  Or kiss it off, perhaps.  The man was as smug as he was comely.  Of all the knights in Dorne, why did my father chose this one to be my shield?  He knows our history.  \"It is just a game.  Tell me of Prince Viserys.\"\n\n\"The Beggar King?\"  Ser Daemon seemed surprised.  \n\n\"Everyone says that Prince Rhaegar was beautiful.  Was Viserys beautiful as well?\"\n\n\"I suppose.  He was Targaryen.  I never saw the man.\"\n\nThe secret pact that Prince Doran had made all those years called for Arianne to be wed to Prince Viserys, not Quentyn to Daenerys.  It had all come undone on the Dothraki sea, when he was murdered.  Crowned with a pot of molten gold.  \"He was killed by a Dothraki khal,\" said Arianne.  \"The dragon queen’s own husband.\"\n\n\"So I’ve heard.  What of it?\"      \n\n\"Just… why did Daenerys let it happen?  Viserys was her brother.  All that remained of her own blood.\"\n\n\"The Dothraki are a savage folk.  Who can know why they kill?  Perhaps Viserys wiped his arse with the wrong hand.\"\n\nPerhaps, thought Arianne, or perhaps Daenerys realized that once her brother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest of her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse.  \"She is the Mad King’s daughter,\" the princess said.  \"How do we do know — \"\n\n\"We cannot know,\" Ser Daemon said.  \"We can only hope.\"\n","source":"_posts/ARIANNE.md","raw":"---\ntitle: ARIANNE\ndate: 2016-03-31 23:07:07\ntags: 冰与火之歌\ncomments: false\n---\n## ARIANNEE\\--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\n\nThey struck out north by northwest, across drylands and parched plains and pale sands toward Ghost Hill, the stronghold of House Toland, where the ship that would take them across the Sea of Dorne awaited them.  \"Send a raven whenever you have news,\" Prince Doran told her, \"but report only what you know to be true.  We are lost in fog here, besieged by rumors, falsehoods, and traveler’s tales.  I dare not act until I know for a certainty what is happening.\"\n\nWar is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be spared.  \"Doom and death are coming,\" Ellaria Sand had warned them, before she took her own leave from Prince Doran.  \"It is time for my little snakes to scatter, the better to survive the carnage.\"  Ellaria was returning to her father’s seat at Hellholt.  With her went her daughter Loreza, who had just turned seven.  Dorea remained at the Water Gardens, one child amongst a hundred.Obella was to be dispatched to Sunspear, to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of the castellan, Manfrey Martell.\n<!-- more -->\nAnd Elia Sand, oldest of the four girls that Prince Oberyn had fathered on Ellaria, would cross the Sea of Dorne with Arianne.  \"As a lady, not a lance,\" her mother said firmly, but like all the Sand Snakes, Elia had her own mind.\n\nThey crossed the sands in two long days and the better part of two nights, stopping thrice to change their horses.  It was a lonely time for Arianne, surrounded by so many strangers.  Elia was her cousin, but half a child, and Daemon Sand… things had never been the same between her and the Bastard of Godsgrace after her father refused his offer for her hand.  He was a boy then, and bastard born, no fit consort for a princess of Dorne, he should have known better.  And it was my father’s will, not mine.  The rest of her companions she hardly knew at all.    \n\nArianne missed her friends.  Drey and Garin and her sweet Spotted Slyva had been a part of her since she was little, trusted confidants who had shared her dreams and secrets, cheered her when she was sad, helped her face her fears.  One of them had betrayed her, but she missed them all the same.  It was my own fault.  Arianne had made them part of her plot to steal off with Myrcella Baratheon and crown her queen, an act of rebellion meant to force her father’s hand, but someone’s loose tongue had undone her.  The clumsy conspiracy had accomplished nothing, except to cost poor Myrcella part of her face, and Ser Arys Oakheart his life.\n\nArianne missed Ser Arys too, more than she ever would have thought.  He loved me madly, she told herself, yet I was never more than fond of him.  I made use of him in mybed and in my plot, took his love and took his honor, gave him nothing but my body.  In the end he could not live with what we’d done.  Why else would her white knight have charged right into Areo Hotah’s longaxe, to die the way he did?  I was a foolish willful girl, playing at the game of thrones like a drunkard rolling dice.  \n\nThe cost of her folly had been dear.  Drey had been sent across the world to Norvos, Garin exiled to Tyrosh for two years, her sweet silly smiling Slyva married off to Eldon Estermont, a man old enough to be her grandsire.  Ser Arys had paid with his life’s blood, Myrcella with an ear.  \n\nOnly Ser Gerold Dayne had escaped unscathed.  Darkstar.  If Myrcella’s horse had not shied at the last instant, his longsword would have opened her from chest to waist instead just taking off her ear.  Dayne was her most grievous sin, the one that Arianne most regretted.  With one stroke of his sword, he had changed her botched plot into something foul and bloody.  If the gods were good, by now Obara Sand had treed him in his mountain fastness and put an end to him.\n\nShe said as much to Daemon Sand that first night, as they made camp.  \"Be careful what you pray for, princess,\" he replied.  \"Darkstar could put an end to Lady Obara just as easily.\"\n\n\"She has Areo Hotah with her.\"  Prince Doran’s captain of guards had dispatched Ser Arys Oakheart with a single blow, though the Kingsguard were supposed to be the finest knights in all the realm.  \"No man can stand against Hotah.\"\n\n\"Is that what Darkstar is?  A man?\"  Ser Daemon grimaced.  \"A man would not have done what he did to Princess Myrcella.  Ser Gerold is more a viper than your uncle ever was.  Prince Oberyn could see that he was poison, he said so more than once.  It’s just a pity that he never got around to killing him.\"\n\nPoison, thought Arianne.  Yes.  Pretty poison, though.  That was how he’d fooled her.  Gerold Dayne was hard and cruel, but so fair to look upon that the princess had not believed half the tales she’d heard of him.  Pretty boys had ever been her weakness, particularly the ones who were dark and dangerous as well.  That was before, when I was just a girl, she told herself.  I am a woman now, my father’s daughter.  I have learned that lesson.\n\nCome break of day, they were off again.  Elia Sand led the way, her black braid flying behind her as she raced across the dry, cracked plains and up into the hills.  The girl was mad for horses, which might be why she often smelled like one, to the despair of her mother.  Sometimes Arianne felt sorry for Ellaria.  Four girls, and every one of them her father’s daughter.  \n\nThe rest of the party kept a more sedate pace.  The princess found herself riding beside Ser Daemon, remembering other rides when they were younger, rides that often ended in embraces.  When she found herself stealing glances at him, tall and gallant in the saddle, Arianne reminded herself that she was heir to Dorne, and him no more than her shield.  \"Tell me what you know of this Jon Connington,\" she commanded.\n\n\"He’s dead,\" said Daemon Sand.  \"He died in the Disputed Lands.  Of drink, I’ve heard it said.\"      \n\n\"So a dead drunk leads this army?\"\n\n\"Perhaps this Jon Connington is a son of that one.  Or just some clever sellsword who has taken on a dead man’s name.\"\n\n\"Or he never died at all.\"  Could Connington have been pretending to be dead for all these years?  That would require patience worthy of her father.  The thought made Arianne uneasy.  Treating with a man that subtle could be perilous.  \"What was he like before he… before he died?\"\n\n\"I was a boy at Godsgrace when he was sent into exile.  I never knew the man.\"\n\n\"Then tell me what you’ve heard of him from others.\"\n\n\"As my princess commands.  Connington was Lord of Griffin’s Roost when Griffin’s Roost was still a lordship worth the having.  Prince Rhaegar’s squire, or one of them.  Later Prince Rhaegar’s friend and companion.  The Mad King named him Hand during Robert’s Rebellion, but he was defeated at Stoney Sept in the Battle of the Bells, and Robert slipped away.  King Aerys was wroth, and sent Connington into exile.  There he died.\"\n\n\"Or not.\"  Prince Doran had told her all of that.  There must be more.  \"Those are just the things he did.  I know all that.  What sort of man was he?  Honest and honorable, venal and grasping, proud?\"\n\n\"Proud, for a certainty.  Even arrogant.  A faithful friend to Rhaegar, but prickly with others.  Robert was his liege, but I’ve heard it said that Connington chafed at serving such a lord.  Even then, Robert was known to be fond of wine and whores.\"\n\n\"No whores for Lord Jon, then?\"\n\n\"I could not say.  Some men keep their whoring secret.\"\n\n\"Did he have a wife?  A paramour?\"\n\nSer Daemon shrugged.  \"Not that I have ever heard.\"\n\nThat was troubling too.  Ser Arys Oakheart had broken his vows for her, but it did not sound as if Jon Connington could be similarly swayed.  Can I match such a man with words alone?\n\nThe princess lapsed into silence, all the while pondering what she would find at journey’s end.  That night when they made camp, she crept into the tent she shared with Jayne Ladybright and Elia Sand and slipped the bit of parchment out of her sleeve to read the words again.\n\n>*To Prince Doran of House Martell,*  \n{% centerquote %}\nYou will remember me, I pray.I knew your sister well,and was a leal servant of your good-brother.I grieve for them as you do.I did not die, no more than did your sister’s son.To save his life we kept him hidden,but the time for hiding is done.  A dragon has returned to Westeros to claim his birthright and seek vengeance for his father, and for the princess Elia, his mother.In her name I turn to Dorne.Do not forsake us.{% endcenterquote %}\n>Jon Connington  \n>Lord of Griffin’s Roost  \n>Hand of the True King\n\n\nArianne read the letter thrice, then rolled it up and tucked it back into her sleeve.  A dragon has returned to Westeros, but not the dragon my father was expecting.  Nowhere in the words was there a mention of Daenerys Stormborn… nor of Prince Quentyn, her brother, who had been sent to seek the dragon queen.  The princess remembered how her father had pressed the onyx cyvasse piece into her palm, his voice hoarse and low as he confessed his plan.  A long and perilous voyage, with an uncertain welcome at its end, he had said.  He has gone to bring us back our heart’s desire.  Vengeance.  Justice.  Fire and blood.\n\nFire and blood was what Jon Connington (if indeed it was him) was offering as well.  Or was it?  \"He comes with sellswords, but no dragons,\" Prince Doran had told her, the night the raven came.  \"The Golden Company is the best and largest of the free companies, but ten thousand mercenaries cannot hope to win the Seven Kingdoms.  Elia’s son… I would weep for joy if some part of my sister had survived, but what proof do we have that this is Aegon?\"  His voice broke when he said that.  \"Where are the dragons?\" he asked.  \"Where is Daenerys?\" and Arianne knew that he was really saying, \"Where is my son?\"\n\nIn the Boneway and the Prince’s Pass, two Dornish hosts had massed, and there they sat, sharpening their spears, polishing their armor, dicing, drinking, quarreling, their numbers dwindling by the day, waiting, waiting, waiting for the Prince of Dorne to loose them on the enemies of House Martell.  Waiting for the dragons.  For fire and blood.  For me.  One word from Arianne and those armies would march… so long as that word wasdragon.  If instead the word she sent was war, Lord Yronwood and Lord Fowler and their armies would remain in place.  The Prince of Dorne was nothing if not subtle; here warmeant wait.  \n\nAt mid-morning on the third day Ghost Hill loomed up before them, its chalk-white walls shining against the deep blue of the Sea of Dorne.  From the square towers at the castle’s corners flew the banners of House Toland; a green dragon biting its own tail, upon a golden field.  The sun-and-spear of House Martell streamed atop the great central keep, gold and red and orange, defiant.\n\nRavens had flown ahead to warn Lady Toland of their coming, so the castle gates were open, and Nymella’s eldest daughter rode forth with her steward to meet them near the bottom of the hill.  Tall and fierce, with a blaze of bright red hair tumbling about her shoulders, Valena Toland greeted Arianne with a shout of, \"Come at last, have you?  How slow are those horses?\"\n\n\"Swift enough to outrun yours to the castle gates.\"    \n\n\"We will see about that.\"  Valena wheeled her big red around and put her heels into him, and the race was on, through the dusty lanes of the village at the bottom of the hill, as chickens and villagers alike scrambled out of their path.  Arianne was three horse lengths behind by the time she got her mare up to a gallop, but had closed to one halfway up the slope.  The two of them were side-by-side as they thundered towards the gatehouse, but five yards from the gates Elia Sand came flying from the cloud of dust behind them to rush past both of them on her black filly.\n\n\"Are you half horse, child?\" Valena asked, laughing, in the yard.  \"Princess, did you bring a stable girl?\"\n\n\"I’m Elia,\" the girl announced.  \"Lady Lance.\"\n\nWhoever hung that name on her has much to answer for.  Like as not it had been Prince Oberyn, though, and the Red Viper had never answered to anyone but himself.\n\n\"The girl jouster,\" Valena said.  \"Yes, I’ve heard of you.  Since you were the first to the yard, you’ve won the honor of watering and bridling the horses.\"\n\n\"And after that find the bath house,\" said Princess Arianne.  Elia was chalk and dust from heels to hair.  \n\nThat night Arianne and her knights supped with Lady Nymella and her daughters in the great hall of the castle.  Teora, the younger girl, had the same red hair as her sister, but elsewise could not have been more different.  Short, plump, and so shy she might have passed for a mute, she displayed more interest in the spiced beef and honeyed duck than in the comely young knights at the table, and seemed content to let her lady mother and her sister speak for House Toland.  \n\n\"We have heard the same tales here that you have heard at Sunspear,\" Lady Nymella told them as her serving man poured the wine.  \"Sellswords landing on Cape Wrath, castles under siege or being taken, crops seized or burned.  Where these men come from and who they are, no one is certain.\"\n\n\"Pirates and adventurers, we heard at first,\" said Valena.  \"Then it was supposed to be the Golden Company.  Now it’s said to be Jon Connington, the Mad King’s Hand, come back from the grave to reclaim his birthright.  Whoever it is, Griffin’s Roost has fallen to them.  Rain House, Crow’s Nest, Mistwood, even Greenstone on its island.  All taken.\"\n\nArianne’s thoughts went at once to her sweet Spotted Slyva.  \"Who would want Greenstone?  Was there a battle?\"\n\n\"Not as we have heard, but all the tales are garbled.\"\n\n\"Tarth has fallen too, some fisherfolk will tell you,\" said Valena.  \"These sellswords now hold most of Cape Wrath and half the Stepstones.  We hear talk of elephants in the rainwood.\"\n\n\"Elephants?\"  Arianne did not know what to think of that.  \"Are you certain?  Not dragons?\"\n\n\"Elephants,\" Lady Nymella said firmly.\n\n\"And krakens off the Broken Arm, pulling under crippled galleys,\" said Valena.  \"The blood draws them to the surface, our maester claims.  There are bodies in the water.  A few have washed up on our shores.  And that’s not half of it.  A new pirate king has set up on Torturer’s Deep.  The Lord of the Waters, he styles himself.  This one has real warships, three-deckers, monstrous large.  You were wise not to come by sea.  Since the Redwyne fleet passed through the Stepstones, those waters are crawling with strange sails, all the way north to the Straights of Tarth and Shipbreaker’s Bay.  Myrmen, Volantenes, Lyseni, even reavers from the Iron Islands.  Some have entered the Sea of Dorne to land men on the south shore of Cape Wrath.  We found a good fast ship for you, as your father commanded, but even so… be careful.\"\n\nIt is true, then.  Arianne wanted to ask after her brother, but her father had urged her to watch every word.  If these ships had not brought Quentyn home again with his dragon queen, best not to mention him.  Only her father and a few of his most trusted men knew about her brother’s mission to Slaver’s Bay.  Lady Toland and her daughters were not amongst them.  If it were Quentyn, he would have brought Daenerys back to Dorne, surely.  Why would he risk a landing on Cape Wrath, amongst the stormlords?  \n\n\"Is Dorne at risk?\" Lady Nymella asked.  \"I confess, each time I see a strange sail my heart leaps to my throat.  What if these ships turn south?  The best part of the Toland strength is with Lord Yronwood in the Boneway.  Who will defend Ghost Hill if these strangers land upon our shores?  Should I call my men home?\"\n\n\"Your men are needed where they are, my lady,\" Daemon Sand assured her.  Arianne was quick to nod.  Any other counsel could well lead to Lord Yronwood’s host unravelling like an old tapestry as each man rushed home to defend his own lands against supposed enemies who might or might not ever come.  \"Once we know beyond a doubt whether these be friends or foes, my father will know what to do,\" the princess said.\n\nIt was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the creamcakes on her plate.  \"It is dragons.\"      \n\n\"Dragons?\"  said her mother.  \"Teora, don’t be mad.\"\n\n\"I’m not.  They’re coming.\"\n\n\"How could you possibly know that?\" her sister asked, with a note of scorn in her voice.\n\n\"One of your little dreams?\"\n\nTeora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling.  \"They were dancing.  In my dream.  And everywhere the dragons danced the people died.\"\n\n\"Seven save us.\"  Lady Nymella gave an exasperated sigh.\n\n\"If you did not eat so many creamcakes you would not have such dreams.  Rich foods are not for girls your age, when your humors are so unbalanced.  Maester Toman says — \"\n\n\"I hate Maester Toman,\" Teora said.  Then she bolted from the table, leaving her lady mother to make apologies for her.\n\n\"Be gentle with her, my lady,\" Arianne said.  \"I remember when I was her age.  My father despaired of me, I’m sure.\"  \n\n\"I can attest to that.\"  Ser Daemon took a sip of wine and said, \"House Toland has a dragon on its banners.\"  \n\n\"A dragon eating its own tail, aye,\" Valena said.  \"From the days of Aegon’s Conquest.  He did not conquer here.  Elsewhere he burned his foes, him and his sisters, but here we melted away before them, leaving only stone and sand for them to burn.  And round and round the dragons went, snapping at their tails for want of any other food, till they were tied in knots.\"\n\n\"Our forebears played their part in that,\" Lady Nymella said proudly.  \"Bold deeds were done, and brave men died.  All of it was written down by the maesters who served us.  We have books, if my princess would like to know more.\"\n\n\"Some other time, perhaps,\" said Arianne.\n\nAs Ghost Hill slept that night, the princess donned a hooded cloak against the chill and and walked the castle battlements to clear her thoughts.  Daemon Sand found her leaning on a parapet and gazing out to sea, where the moon was dancing on the water.  \"Princess,\" he said.  \"You ought to be abed.\"\n\n\"I could say the same of you.\"  Arianne turned to gaze upon his face.  A good face, she decided.  The boy I knew has become a handsome man.  His eyes were as blue as a desert sky, his hair the light brown of the sands they had just crossed.  A close-cropped beard followed the thin of a strong jaw, but could not quite hide the dimples when he smiled.  I always loved his smile.\n\nThe Bastard of Godsgrace was one of Dorne’s finest swords as well, as might be expected from one who had been Prince Oberyn’s squire and had received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself.  Some said that he had been her uncle’s lover too, though seldom to his face.  Arianne did not know the truth of that.  He had been her lover, though.  At fourteen she had given him her maidenhead.  Daemon had not been much older, so their couplings had been as clumsy as they were ardent.  Still, it had been sweet.  \n\nArianne gave him her most seductive smile.  \"We might share a bed together.\"\n\nSer Daemon’s face was stone.  \"Have you forgotten, princess?  I am bastard born.\"  He took her hand in his.  \"If I am unworthy of this hand, how can I be worthy of your cunt?\"\n\nShe snatched her hand away.  \"You deserve a slap for that.\"  \n\n\"My face is yours.  Do what you will.\"\n\n\"What I will you will not, it seems.  So be it.  Talk with me instead.  Could this truly be Prince Aegon?\"\n\n\"Gregor Clegane ripped Aegon out of Elia’s arms and smashed his head against a wall,\" Ser Daemon said.  \"If Lord Connington’s prince has a crushed skull, I will believe that Aegon Targaryen has returned from the grave.  Elsewise, no.  This is some feigned boy, no more.  A sellsword’s ploy to win support.\"\n\nMy father fears the same.  \"If not, though… if this truly is Jon Connington, if the boy is Rhaegar’s son… \"\n\n\"Are you hoping that he is, or that he’s not?\"\n\n\"I… it would give great joy to my father if Elia’s son were still alive.  He loved his sister well.\"\n\n\"It was you I asked about, not your father.\"\n\nSo it was.  \"I was seven when Elia died.  They say I held her daughter Rhaenys once, when I was too young to remember.  Aegon will be a stranger to me, whether true or false.\"  The princess paused.  \"We looked for Rhaegar’s sister, not his son.\"  Her father had confided in Ser Daemon when he chose him as his daughter’s shield; with him at least she could speak freely.  \"I would sooner it were Quentyn who’d returned.\"\n\n\"Or so you say,\" said Daemon Sand.  \"Good night, princess.\"  He bowed to her, and left her standing there.\n\nWhat did he mean by that?  Arianne watched him walk away.  What sort of sister would I be, if I did not want my brother back?  It was true, she had resented Quentyn for all those years that she had thought their father meant to name him as his heir in place of her, but that had turned out to be just a misunderstanding.  She was the heir to Dorne, she had her father’s word on that.  Quentyn would have his dragon queen, Daenerys.\n\nIn Sunspear hung a portrait of the Princess Daenerys who had come to Dorne to marry one of Arianne’s forebears.  In her younger days Arianne had spent hours gazing at it, back when she was just a pudgy flat-chested girl on the cusp of maidenhood who prayed every night for the gods to make her pretty.  A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace.  Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort.King Quentyn.  Why did that sound so silly?  \n\nAlmost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon.  Her brother was an earnest boy,well-behaved and dutiful, but dull.  And plain, so plain.  The gods had given Arianne the beauty she had prayed for, but Quentyn must have prayed for something else.  His head was overlarge and sort of square, his hair the color of dried mud.  His shoulders slumped as well, and he was too thick about the middle.  He looks too much like Father.\n\n\"I love my brother,\" said Arianne, though only the moon could hear her.  Though if truth be told, she scarcely knew him.  Quentyn had been fostered by Lord Anders of House Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, the son of Lord Ormond Yronwood and grandson of Lord Edgar.  In his youth her uncle Oberyn had fought a duel with Edgar, had given him a wound that mortified and killed him.  Afterward men called him ‘the Red Viper,’ and spoke of poison on his blade.  The Yronwoods were an ancient house, proud and powerful.  Before the coming of the Rhoynar they had been kings over half of Dorne, with domains that dwarfed those of House Martell.  Blood feud and rebellion would surely have followed Lord Edgar’s death, had not her father acted at once.  The Red Viper went to Oldtown, thence across to the narrow sea to Lys, though none dared call it exile.  And in due time, Quentyn was given to Lord Anders to foster as a sign of trust.  That helped to heal the breach between Sunspear and the Yronwoods, but it had opened new ones between Quentyn and the Sand Snakes… and Arianne had always been closer to her cousins than to her distant brother.\n\n\"We are still the same blood, though,\" she whispered.  \"Of course I want my brother home.  I do.\"  The wind off the sea was raising gooseprickles all up and down her arms.  Arianne pulled her cloak about herself, and went off to seek her bed.\n\nTheir ship was called the Peregrine.  They sailed upon the morning tide.  The gods were good to them, the sea calm.  Even with good winds, the crossing took a day and a night.  Jayne Ladybright grew greensick and spent most of the voyage spewing, which Elia Sand seemed to find hilarious.  \"Someone needs to spank that child,\" Joss Hood was heard to say… but Elia was amongst those who heard him say it.\n\n\"I am almost a woman grown, ser,\" she responded haughtily.  \"I’ll let you spank me, though…  but first you’ll need to tilt with me, and knock me off my horse.\"\n\n\"We are on a ship, and without horses,\" Joss replied.\n\n\"And ladies do not joust,\" insisted Ser Garibald Shells, a far more serious and proper young man than his companion.\n\n\"I do.  I’m Lady Lance.\"\n\nArianne had heard enough.  \"You may be a lance, but you are no lady.  Go below and stay there till we reach land.\"\n\nElsewise the crossing was uneventful.  At dusk they spied a galley in the distance, her oars rising and falling against the evening stars, but she was moving away from them, and soon dwindled and was gone.  Arianne played a game of cyvasse with Ser Daemon, and another one with Garibald Shells, and somehow managed to lose both.  Ser Garibald was kind enough to say that she played a gallant game, but Daemon mocked her.  \"You have other pieces beside the dragon, princess.  Try moving them sometime.\"\n\n\"I like the dragon.\"  She wanted to slap the smile off his face.  Or kiss it off, perhaps.  The man was as smug as he was comely.  Of all the knights in Dorne, why did my father chose this one to be my shield?  He knows our history.  \"It is just a game.  Tell me of Prince Viserys.\"\n\n\"The Beggar King?\"  Ser Daemon seemed surprised.  \n\n\"Everyone says that Prince Rhaegar was beautiful.  Was Viserys beautiful as well?\"\n\n\"I suppose.  He was Targaryen.  I never saw the man.\"\n\nThe secret pact that Prince Doran had made all those years called for Arianne to be wed to Prince Viserys, not Quentyn to Daenerys.  It had all come undone on the Dothraki sea, when he was murdered.  Crowned with a pot of molten gold.  \"He was killed by a Dothraki khal,\" said Arianne.  \"The dragon queen’s own husband.\"\n\n\"So I’ve heard.  What of it?\"      \n\n\"Just… why did Daenerys let it happen?  Viserys was her brother.  All that remained of her own blood.\"\n\n\"The Dothraki are a savage folk.  Who can know why they kill?  Perhaps Viserys wiped his arse with the wrong hand.\"\n\nPerhaps, thought Arianne, or perhaps Daenerys realized that once her brother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest of her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse.  \"She is the Mad King’s daughter,\" the princess said.  \"How do we do know — \"\n\n\"We cannot know,\" Ser Daemon said.  \"We can only hope.\"\n","slug":"ARIANNE","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.496Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vks4000qpmnkdo6s2b4u","content":"<h2 id=\"ariannee--excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter\">ARIANNEE--EXCERPT\nFROM THE WINDS OF WINTER</h2>\n<p>They struck out north by northwest, across drylands and parched\nplains and pale sands toward Ghost Hill, the stronghold of House Toland,\nwhere the ship that would take them across the Sea of Dorne awaited\nthem. \"Send a raven whenever you have news,\" Prince Doran told her, \"but\nreport only what you know to be true. We are lost in fog here, besieged\nby rumors, falsehoods, and traveler’s tales. I dare not act until I know\nfor a certainty what is happening.\"</p>\n<p>War is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be\nspared. \"Doom and death are coming,\" Ellaria Sand had warned them,\nbefore she took her own leave from Prince Doran. \"It is time for my\nlittle snakes to scatter, the better to survive the carnage.\" Ellaria\nwas returning to her father’s seat at Hellholt. With her went her\ndaughter Loreza, who had just turned seven. Dorea remained at the Water\nGardens, one child amongst a hundred.Obella was to be dispatched to\nSunspear, to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of the castellan, Manfrey\nMartell. <span id=\"more\"></span> And Elia Sand, oldest of the four girls that\nPrince Oberyn had fathered on Ellaria, would cross the Sea of Dorne with\nArianne. \"As a lady, not a lance,\" her mother said firmly, but like all\nthe Sand Snakes, Elia had her own mind.</p>\n<p>They crossed the sands in two long days and the better part of two\nnights, stopping thrice to change their horses. It was a lonely time for\nArianne, surrounded by so many strangers. Elia was her cousin, but half\na child, and Daemon Sand… things had never been the same between her and\nthe Bastard of Godsgrace after her father refused his offer for her\nhand. He was a boy then, and bastard born, no fit consort for a princess\nof Dorne, he should have known better. And it was my father’s will, not\nmine. The rest of her companions she hardly knew at all.</p>\n<p>Arianne missed her friends. Drey and Garin and her sweet Spotted\nSlyva had been a part of her since she was little, trusted confidants\nwho had shared her dreams and secrets, cheered her when she was sad,\nhelped her face her fears. One of them had betrayed her, but she missed\nthem all the same. It was my own fault. Arianne had made them part of\nher plot to steal off with Myrcella Baratheon and crown her queen, an\nact of rebellion meant to force her father’s hand, but someone’s loose\ntongue had undone her. The clumsy conspiracy had accomplished nothing,\nexcept to cost poor Myrcella part of her face, and Ser Arys Oakheart his\nlife.</p>\n<p>Arianne missed Ser Arys too, more than she ever would have thought.\nHe loved me madly, she told herself, yet I was never more than fond of\nhim. I made use of him in mybed and in my plot, took his love and took\nhis honor, gave him nothing but my body. In the end he could not live\nwith what we’d done. Why else would her white knight have charged right\ninto Areo Hotah’s longaxe, to die the way he did? I was a foolish\nwillful girl, playing at the game of thrones like a drunkard rolling\ndice.</p>\n<p>The cost of her folly had been dear. Drey had been sent across the\nworld to Norvos, Garin exiled to Tyrosh for two years, her sweet silly\nsmiling Slyva married off to Eldon Estermont, a man old enough to be her\ngrandsire. Ser Arys had paid with his life’s blood, Myrcella with an\near.</p>\n<p>Only Ser Gerold Dayne had escaped unscathed. Darkstar. If Myrcella’s\nhorse had not shied at the last instant, his longsword would have opened\nher from chest to waist instead just taking off her ear. Dayne was her\nmost grievous sin, the one that Arianne most regretted. With one stroke\nof his sword, he had changed her botched plot into something foul and\nbloody. If the gods were good, by now Obara Sand had treed him in his\nmountain fastness and put an end to him.</p>\n<p>She said as much to Daemon Sand that first night, as they made camp.\n\"Be careful what you pray for, princess,\" he replied. \"Darkstar could\nput an end to Lady Obara just as easily.\"</p>\n<p>\"She has Areo Hotah with her.\" Prince Doran’s captain of guards had\ndispatched Ser Arys Oakheart with a single blow, though the Kingsguard\nwere supposed to be the finest knights in all the realm. \"No man can\nstand against Hotah.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that what Darkstar is? A man?\" Ser Daemon grimaced. \"A man would\nnot have done what he did to Princess Myrcella. Ser Gerold is more a\nviper than your uncle ever was. Prince Oberyn could see that he was\npoison, he said so more than once. It’s just a pity that he never got\naround to killing him.\"</p>\n<p>Poison, thought Arianne. Yes. Pretty poison, though. That was how\nhe’d fooled her. Gerold Dayne was hard and cruel, but so fair to look\nupon that the princess had not believed half the tales she’d heard of\nhim. Pretty boys had ever been her weakness, particularly the ones who\nwere dark and dangerous as well. That was before, when I was just a\ngirl, she told herself. I am a woman now, my father’s daughter. I have\nlearned that lesson.</p>\n<p>Come break of day, they were off again. Elia Sand led the way, her\nblack braid flying behind her as she raced across the dry, cracked\nplains and up into the hills. The girl was mad for horses, which might\nbe why she often smelled like one, to the despair of her mother.\nSometimes Arianne felt sorry for Ellaria. Four girls, and every one of\nthem her father’s daughter.</p>\n<p>The rest of the party kept a more sedate pace. The princess found\nherself riding beside Ser Daemon, remembering other rides when they were\nyounger, rides that often ended in embraces. When she found herself\nstealing glances at him, tall and gallant in the saddle, Arianne\nreminded herself that she was heir to Dorne, and him no more than her\nshield. \"Tell me what you know of this Jon Connington,\" she\ncommanded.</p>\n<p>\"He’s dead,\" said Daemon Sand. \"He died in the Disputed Lands. Of\ndrink, I’ve heard it said.\"</p>\n<p>\"So a dead drunk leads this army?\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps this Jon Connington is a son of that one. Or just some\nclever sellsword who has taken on a dead man’s name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or he never died at all.\" Could Connington have been pretending to\nbe dead for all these years? That would require patience worthy of her\nfather. The thought made Arianne uneasy. Treating with a man that subtle\ncould be perilous. \"What was he like before he… before he died?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was a boy at Godsgrace when he was sent into exile. I never knew\nthe man.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then tell me what you’ve heard of him from others.\"</p>\n<p>\"As my princess commands. Connington was Lord of Griffin’s Roost when\nGriffin’s Roost was still a lordship worth the having. Prince Rhaegar’s\nsquire, or one of them. Later Prince Rhaegar’s friend and companion. The\nMad King named him Hand during Robert’s Rebellion, but he was defeated\nat Stoney Sept in the Battle of the Bells, and Robert slipped away. King\nAerys was wroth, and sent Connington into exile. There he died.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or not.\" Prince Doran had told her all of that. There must be more.\n\"Those are just the things he did. I know all that. What sort of man was\nhe? Honest and honorable, venal and grasping, proud?\"</p>\n<p>\"Proud, for a certainty. Even arrogant. A faithful friend to Rhaegar,\nbut prickly with others. Robert was his liege, but I’ve heard it said\nthat Connington chafed at serving such a lord. Even then, Robert was\nknown to be fond of wine and whores.\"</p>\n<p>\"No whores for Lord Jon, then?\"</p>\n<p>\"I could not say. Some men keep their whoring secret.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did he have a wife? A paramour?\"</p>\n<p>Ser Daemon shrugged. \"Not that I have ever heard.\"</p>\n<p>That was troubling too. Ser Arys Oakheart had broken his vows for\nher, but it did not sound as if Jon Connington could be similarly\nswayed. Can I match such a man with words alone?</p>\n<p>The princess lapsed into silence, all the while pondering what she\nwould find at journey’s end. That night when they made camp, she crept\ninto the tent she shared with Jayne Ladybright and Elia Sand and slipped\nthe bit of parchment out of her sleeve to read the words again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>To Prince Doran of House Martell,</em><br />\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote-center\">\n<p>You will remember me, I pray.I knew your sister well,and was a leal\nservant of your good-brother.I grieve for them as you do.I did not die,\nno more than did your sister’s son.To save his life we kept him\nhidden,but the time for hiding is done. A dragon has returned to\nWesteros to claim his birthright and seek vengeance for his father, and\nfor the princess Elia, his mother.In her name I turn to Dorne.Do not\nforsake us.</p>\n\n</blockquote> Jon Connington<br />\nLord of Griffin’s Roost<br />\nHand of the True King</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Arianne read the letter thrice, then rolled it up and tucked it back\ninto her sleeve. A dragon has returned to Westeros, but not the dragon\nmy father was expecting. Nowhere in the words was there a mention of\nDaenerys Stormborn… nor of Prince Quentyn, her brother, who had been\nsent to seek the dragon queen. The princess remembered how her father\nhad pressed the onyx cyvasse piece into her palm, his voice hoarse and\nlow as he confessed his plan. A long and perilous voyage, with an\nuncertain welcome at its end, he had said. He has gone to bring us back\nour heart’s desire. Vengeance. Justice. Fire and blood.</p>\n<p>Fire and blood was what Jon Connington (if indeed it was him) was\noffering as well. Or was it? \"He comes with sellswords, but no dragons,\"\nPrince Doran had told her, the night the raven came. \"The Golden Company\nis the best and largest of the free companies, but ten thousand\nmercenaries cannot hope to win the Seven Kingdoms. Elia’s son… I would\nweep for joy if some part of my sister had survived, but what proof do\nwe have that this is Aegon?\" His voice broke when he said that. \"Where\nare the dragons?\" he asked. \"Where is Daenerys?\" and Arianne knew that\nhe was really saying, \"Where is my son?\"</p>\n<p>In the Boneway and the Prince’s Pass, two Dornish hosts had massed,\nand there they sat, sharpening their spears, polishing their armor,\ndicing, drinking, quarreling, their numbers dwindling by the day,\nwaiting, waiting, waiting for the Prince of Dorne to loose them on the\nenemies of House Martell. Waiting for the dragons. For fire and blood.\nFor me. One word from Arianne and those armies would march… so long as\nthat word wasdragon. If instead the word she sent was war, Lord Yronwood\nand Lord Fowler and their armies would remain in place. The Prince of\nDorne was nothing if not subtle; here warmeant wait.</p>\n<p>At mid-morning on the third day Ghost Hill loomed up before them, its\nchalk-white walls shining against the deep blue of the Sea of Dorne.\nFrom the square towers at the castle’s corners flew the banners of House\nToland; a green dragon biting its own tail, upon a golden field. The\nsun-and-spear of House Martell streamed atop the great central keep,\ngold and red and orange, defiant.</p>\n<p>Ravens had flown ahead to warn Lady Toland of their coming, so the\ncastle gates were open, and Nymella’s eldest daughter rode forth with\nher steward to meet them near the bottom of the hill. Tall and fierce,\nwith a blaze of bright red hair tumbling about her shoulders, Valena\nToland greeted Arianne with a shout of, \"Come at last, have you? How\nslow are those horses?\"</p>\n<p>\"Swift enough to outrun yours to the castle gates.\"</p>\n<p>\"We will see about that.\" Valena wheeled her big red around and put\nher heels into him, and the race was on, through the dusty lanes of the\nvillage at the bottom of the hill, as chickens and villagers alike\nscrambled out of their path. Arianne was three horse lengths behind by\nthe time she got her mare up to a gallop, but had closed to one halfway\nup the slope. The two of them were side-by-side as they thundered\ntowards the gatehouse, but five yards from the gates Elia Sand came\nflying from the cloud of dust behind them to rush past both of them on\nher black filly.</p>\n<p>\"Are you half horse, child?\" Valena asked, laughing, in the yard.\n\"Princess, did you bring a stable girl?\"</p>\n<p>\"I’m Elia,\" the girl announced. \"Lady Lance.\"</p>\n<p>Whoever hung that name on her has much to answer for. Like as not it\nhad been Prince Oberyn, though, and the Red Viper had never answered to\nanyone but himself.</p>\n<p>\"The girl jouster,\" Valena said. \"Yes, I’ve heard of you. Since you\nwere the first to the yard, you’ve won the honor of watering and\nbridling the horses.\"</p>\n<p>\"And after that find the bath house,\" said Princess Arianne. Elia was\nchalk and dust from heels to hair.</p>\n<p>That night Arianne and her knights supped with Lady Nymella and her\ndaughters in the great hall of the castle. Teora, the younger girl, had\nthe same red hair as her sister, but elsewise could not have been more\ndifferent. Short, plump, and so shy she might have passed for a mute,\nshe displayed more interest in the spiced beef and honeyed duck than in\nthe comely young knights at the table, and seemed content to let her\nlady mother and her sister speak for House Toland.</p>\n<p>\"We have heard the same tales here that you have heard at Sunspear,\"\nLady Nymella told them as her serving man poured the wine. \"Sellswords\nlanding on Cape Wrath, castles under siege or being taken, crops seized\nor burned. Where these men come from and who they are, no one is\ncertain.\"</p>\n<p>\"Pirates and adventurers, we heard at first,\" said Valena. \"Then it\nwas supposed to be the Golden Company. Now it’s said to be Jon\nConnington, the Mad King’s Hand, come back from the grave to reclaim his\nbirthright. Whoever it is, Griffin’s Roost has fallen to them. Rain\nHouse, Crow’s Nest, Mistwood, even Greenstone on its island. All\ntaken.\"</p>\n<p>Arianne’s thoughts went at once to her sweet Spotted Slyva. \"Who\nwould want Greenstone? Was there a battle?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not as we have heard, but all the tales are garbled.\"</p>\n<p>\"Tarth has fallen too, some fisherfolk will tell you,\" said Valena.\n\"These sellswords now hold most of Cape Wrath and half the Stepstones.\nWe hear talk of elephants in the rainwood.\"</p>\n<p>\"Elephants?\" Arianne did not know what to think of that. \"Are you\ncertain? Not dragons?\"</p>\n<p>\"Elephants,\" Lady Nymella said firmly.</p>\n<p>\"And krakens off the Broken Arm, pulling under crippled galleys,\"\nsaid Valena. \"The blood draws them to the surface, our maester claims.\nThere are bodies in the water. A few have washed up on our shores. And\nthat’s not half of it. A new pirate king has set up on Torturer’s Deep.\nThe Lord of the Waters, he styles himself. This one has real warships,\nthree-deckers, monstrous large. You were wise not to come by sea. Since\nthe Redwyne fleet passed through the Stepstones, those waters are\ncrawling with strange sails, all the way north to the Straights of Tarth\nand Shipbreaker’s Bay. Myrmen, Volantenes, Lyseni, even reavers from the\nIron Islands. Some have entered the Sea of Dorne to land men on the\nsouth shore of Cape Wrath. We found a good fast ship for you, as your\nfather commanded, but even so… be careful.\"</p>\n<p>It is true, then. Arianne wanted to ask after her brother, but her\nfather had urged her to watch every word. If these ships had not brought\nQuentyn home again with his dragon queen, best not to mention him. Only\nher father and a few of his most trusted men knew about her brother’s\nmission to Slaver’s Bay. Lady Toland and her daughters were not amongst\nthem. If it were Quentyn, he would have brought Daenerys back to Dorne,\nsurely. Why would he risk a landing on Cape Wrath, amongst the\nstormlords?</p>\n<p>\"Is Dorne at risk?\" Lady Nymella asked. \"I confess, each time I see a\nstrange sail my heart leaps to my throat. What if these ships turn\nsouth? The best part of the Toland strength is with Lord Yronwood in the\nBoneway. Who will defend Ghost Hill if these strangers land upon our\nshores? Should I call my men home?\"</p>\n<p>\"Your men are needed where they are, my lady,\" Daemon Sand assured\nher. Arianne was quick to nod. Any other counsel could well lead to Lord\nYronwood’s host unravelling like an old tapestry as each man rushed home\nto defend his own lands against supposed enemies who might or might not\never come. \"Once we know beyond a doubt whether these be friends or\nfoes, my father will know what to do,\" the princess said.</p>\n<p>It was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the\ncreamcakes on her plate. \"It is dragons.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dragons?\" said her mother. \"Teora, don’t be mad.\"</p>\n<p>\"I’m not. They’re coming.\"</p>\n<p>\"How could you possibly know that?\" her sister asked, with a note of\nscorn in her voice.</p>\n<p>\"One of your little dreams?\"</p>\n<p>Teora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling. \"They were dancing. In my\ndream. And everywhere the dragons danced the people died.\"</p>\n<p>\"Seven save us.\" Lady Nymella gave an exasperated sigh.</p>\n<p>\"If you did not eat so many creamcakes you would not have such\ndreams. Rich foods are not for girls your age, when your humors are so\nunbalanced. Maester Toman says — \"</p>\n<p>\"I hate Maester Toman,\" Teora said. Then she bolted from the table,\nleaving her lady mother to make apologies for her.</p>\n<p>\"Be gentle with her, my lady,\" Arianne said. \"I remember when I was\nher age. My father despaired of me, I’m sure.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can attest to that.\" Ser Daemon took a sip of wine and said,\n\"House Toland has a dragon on its banners.\"</p>\n<p>\"A dragon eating its own tail, aye,\" Valena said. \"From the days of\nAegon’s Conquest. He did not conquer here. Elsewhere he burned his foes,\nhim and his sisters, but here we melted away before them, leaving only\nstone and sand for them to burn. And round and round the dragons went,\nsnapping at their tails for want of any other food, till they were tied\nin knots.\"</p>\n<p>\"Our forebears played their part in that,\" Lady Nymella said proudly.\n\"Bold deeds were done, and brave men died. All of it was written down by\nthe maesters who served us. We have books, if my princess would like to\nknow more.\"</p>\n<p>\"Some other time, perhaps,\" said Arianne.</p>\n<p>As Ghost Hill slept that night, the princess donned a hooded cloak\nagainst the chill and and walked the castle battlements to clear her\nthoughts. Daemon Sand found her leaning on a parapet and gazing out to\nsea, where the moon was dancing on the water. \"Princess,\" he said. \"You\nought to be abed.\"</p>\n<p>\"I could say the same of you.\" Arianne turned to gaze upon his face.\nA good face, she decided. The boy I knew has become a handsome man. His\neyes were as blue as a desert sky, his hair the light brown of the sands\nthey had just crossed. A close-cropped beard followed the thin of a\nstrong jaw, but could not quite hide the dimples when he smiled. I\nalways loved his smile.</p>\n<p>The Bastard of Godsgrace was one of Dorne’s finest swords as well, as\nmight be expected from one who had been Prince Oberyn’s squire and had\nreceived his knighthood from the Red Viper himself. Some said that he\nhad been her uncle’s lover too, though seldom to his face. Arianne did\nnot know the truth of that. He had been her lover, though. At fourteen\nshe had given him her maidenhead. Daemon had not been much older, so\ntheir couplings had been as clumsy as they were ardent. Still, it had\nbeen sweet.</p>\n<p>Arianne gave him her most seductive smile. \"We might share a bed\ntogether.\"</p>\n<p>Ser Daemon’s face was stone. \"Have you forgotten, princess? I am\nbastard born.\" He took her hand in his. \"If I am unworthy of this hand,\nhow can I be worthy of your cunt?\"</p>\n<p>She snatched her hand away. \"You deserve a slap for that.\"</p>\n<p>\"My face is yours. Do what you will.\"</p>\n<p>\"What I will you will not, it seems. So be it. Talk with me instead.\nCould this truly be Prince Aegon?\"</p>\n<p>\"Gregor Clegane ripped Aegon out of Elia’s arms and smashed his head\nagainst a wall,\" Ser Daemon said. \"If Lord Connington’s prince has a\ncrushed skull, I will believe that Aegon Targaryen has returned from the\ngrave. Elsewise, no. This is some feigned boy, no more. A sellsword’s\nploy to win support.\"</p>\n<p>My father fears the same. \"If not, though… if this truly is Jon\nConnington, if the boy is Rhaegar’s son… \"</p>\n<p>\"Are you hoping that he is, or that he’s not?\"</p>\n<p>\"I… it would give great joy to my father if Elia’s son were still\nalive. He loved his sister well.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was you I asked about, not your father.\"</p>\n<p>So it was. \"I was seven when Elia died. They say I held her daughter\nRhaenys once, when I was too young to remember. Aegon will be a stranger\nto me, whether true or false.\" The princess paused. \"We looked for\nRhaegar’s sister, not his son.\" Her father had confided in Ser Daemon\nwhen he chose him as his daughter’s shield; with him at least she could\nspeak freely. \"I would sooner it were Quentyn who’d returned.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or so you say,\" said Daemon Sand. \"Good night, princess.\" He bowed\nto her, and left her standing there.</p>\n<p>What did he mean by that? Arianne watched him walk away. What sort of\nsister would I be, if I did not want my brother back? It was true, she\nhad resented Quentyn for all those years that she had thought their\nfather meant to name him as his heir in place of her, but that had\nturned out to be just a misunderstanding. She was the heir to Dorne, she\nhad her father’s word on that. Quentyn would have his dragon queen,\nDaenerys.</p>\n<p>In Sunspear hung a portrait of the Princess Daenerys who had come to\nDorne to marry one of Arianne’s forebears. In her younger days Arianne\nhad spent hours gazing at it, back when she was just a pudgy\nflat-chested girl on the cusp of maidenhood who prayed every night for\nthe gods to make her pretty. A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen\ncame to Dorne to make a peace. Now another comes to make a war, and my\nbrother will be her king and consort.King Quentyn. Why did that sound so\nsilly?</p>\n<p>Almost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon. Her brother was an\nearnest boy,well-behaved and dutiful, but dull. And plain, so plain. The\ngods had given Arianne the beauty she had prayed for, but Quentyn must\nhave prayed for something else. His head was overlarge and sort of\nsquare, his hair the color of dried mud. His shoulders slumped as well,\nand he was too thick about the middle. He looks too much like\nFather.</p>\n<p>\"I love my brother,\" said Arianne, though only the moon could hear\nher. Though if truth be told, she scarcely knew him. Quentyn had been\nfostered by Lord Anders of House Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, the son of\nLord Ormond Yronwood and grandson of Lord Edgar. In his youth her uncle\nOberyn had fought a duel with Edgar, had given him a wound that\nmortified and killed him. Afterward men called him ‘the Red Viper,’ and\nspoke of poison on his blade. The Yronwoods were an ancient house, proud\nand powerful. Before the coming of the Rhoynar they had been kings over\nhalf of Dorne, with domains that dwarfed those of House Martell. Blood\nfeud and rebellion would surely have followed Lord Edgar’s death, had\nnot her father acted at once. The Red Viper went to Oldtown, thence\nacross to the narrow sea to Lys, though none dared call it exile. And in\ndue time, Quentyn was given to Lord Anders to foster as a sign of trust.\nThat helped to heal the breach between Sunspear and the Yronwoods, but\nit had opened new ones between Quentyn and the Sand Snakes… and Arianne\nhad always been closer to her cousins than to her distant brother.</p>\n<p>\"We are still the same blood, though,\" she whispered. \"Of course I\nwant my brother home. I do.\" The wind off the sea was raising\ngooseprickles all up and down her arms. Arianne pulled her cloak about\nherself, and went off to seek her bed.</p>\n<p>Their ship was called the Peregrine. They sailed upon the morning\ntide. The gods were good to them, the sea calm. Even with good winds,\nthe crossing took a day and a night. Jayne Ladybright grew greensick and\nspent most of the voyage spewing, which Elia Sand seemed to find\nhilarious. \"Someone needs to spank that child,\" Joss Hood was heard to\nsay… but Elia was amongst those who heard him say it.</p>\n<p>\"I am almost a woman grown, ser,\" she responded haughtily. \"I’ll let\nyou spank me, though… but first you’ll need to tilt with me, and knock\nme off my horse.\"</p>\n<p>\"We are on a ship, and without horses,\" Joss replied.</p>\n<p>\"And ladies do not joust,\" insisted Ser Garibald Shells, a far more\nserious and proper young man than his companion.</p>\n<p>\"I do. I’m Lady Lance.\"</p>\n<p>Arianne had heard enough. \"You may be a lance, but you are no lady.\nGo below and stay there till we reach land.\"</p>\n<p>Elsewise the crossing was uneventful. At dusk they spied a galley in\nthe distance, her oars rising and falling against the evening stars, but\nshe was moving away from them, and soon dwindled and was gone. Arianne\nplayed a game of cyvasse with Ser Daemon, and another one with Garibald\nShells, and somehow managed to lose both. Ser Garibald was kind enough\nto say that she played a gallant game, but Daemon mocked her. \"You have\nother pieces beside the dragon, princess. Try moving them sometime.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like the dragon.\" She wanted to slap the smile off his face. Or\nkiss it off, perhaps. The man was as smug as he was comely. Of all the\nknights in Dorne, why did my father chose this one to be my shield? He\nknows our history. \"It is just a game. Tell me of Prince Viserys.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Beggar King?\" Ser Daemon seemed surprised.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone says that Prince Rhaegar was beautiful. Was Viserys\nbeautiful as well?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose. He was Targaryen. I never saw the man.\"</p>\n<p>The secret pact that Prince Doran had made all those years called for\nArianne to be wed to Prince Viserys, not Quentyn to Daenerys. It had all\ncome undone on the Dothraki sea, when he was murdered. Crowned with a\npot of molten gold. \"He was killed by a Dothraki khal,\" said Arianne.\n\"The dragon queen’s own husband.\"</p>\n<p>\"So I’ve heard. What of it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just… why did Daenerys let it happen? Viserys was her brother. All\nthat remained of her own blood.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Dothraki are a savage folk. Who can know why they kill? Perhaps\nViserys wiped his arse with the wrong hand.\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps, thought Arianne, or perhaps Daenerys realized that once her\nbrother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest\nof her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse. \"She is the\nMad King’s daughter,\" the princess said. \"How do we do know — \"</p>\n<p>\"We cannot know,\" Ser Daemon said. \"We can only hope.\"</p>\n","related_posts":["ALAYNE/","MERCY/"],"length":4692,"excerpt":"<h2 id=\"ariannee--excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter\">ARIANNEE--EXCERPT\nFROM THE WINDS OF WINTER</h2>\n<p>They struck out north by northwest, across drylands and parched\nplains and pale sands toward Ghost Hill, the stronghold of House Toland,\nwhere the ship that would take them across the Sea of Dorne awaited\nthem. \"Send a raven whenever you have news,\" Prince Doran told her, \"but\nreport only what you know to be true. We are lost in fog here, besieged\nby rumors, falsehoods, and traveler’s tales. I dare not act until I know\nfor a certainty what is happening.\"</p>\n<p>War is happening, though Arianne, and this time Dorne will not be\nspared. \"Doom and death are coming,\" Ellaria Sand had warned them,\nbefore she took her own leave from Prince Doran. \"It is time for my\nlittle snakes to scatter, the better to survive the carnage.\" Ellaria\nwas returning to her father’s seat at Hellholt. With her went her\ndaughter Loreza, who had just turned seven. Dorea remained at the Water\nGardens, one child amongst a hundred.Obella was to be dispatched to\nSunspear, to serve as a cupbearer to the wife of the castellan, Manfrey\nMartell.","more":"And Elia Sand, oldest of the four girls that\nPrince Oberyn had fathered on Ellaria, would cross the Sea of Dorne with\nArianne. \"As a lady, not a lance,\" her mother said firmly, but like all\nthe Sand Snakes, Elia had her own mind.</p>\n<p>They crossed the sands in two long days and the better part of two\nnights, stopping thrice to change their horses. It was a lonely time for\nArianne, surrounded by so many strangers. Elia was her cousin, but half\na child, and Daemon Sand… things had never been the same between her and\nthe Bastard of Godsgrace after her father refused his offer for her\nhand. He was a boy then, and bastard born, no fit consort for a princess\nof Dorne, he should have known better. And it was my father’s will, not\nmine. The rest of her companions she hardly knew at all.</p>\n<p>Arianne missed her friends. Drey and Garin and her sweet Spotted\nSlyva had been a part of her since she was little, trusted confidants\nwho had shared her dreams and secrets, cheered her when she was sad,\nhelped her face her fears. One of them had betrayed her, but she missed\nthem all the same. It was my own fault. Arianne had made them part of\nher plot to steal off with Myrcella Baratheon and crown her queen, an\nact of rebellion meant to force her father’s hand, but someone’s loose\ntongue had undone her. The clumsy conspiracy had accomplished nothing,\nexcept to cost poor Myrcella part of her face, and Ser Arys Oakheart his\nlife.</p>\n<p>Arianne missed Ser Arys too, more than she ever would have thought.\nHe loved me madly, she told herself, yet I was never more than fond of\nhim. I made use of him in mybed and in my plot, took his love and took\nhis honor, gave him nothing but my body. In the end he could not live\nwith what we’d done. Why else would her white knight have charged right\ninto Areo Hotah’s longaxe, to die the way he did? I was a foolish\nwillful girl, playing at the game of thrones like a drunkard rolling\ndice.</p>\n<p>The cost of her folly had been dear. Drey had been sent across the\nworld to Norvos, Garin exiled to Tyrosh for two years, her sweet silly\nsmiling Slyva married off to Eldon Estermont, a man old enough to be her\ngrandsire. Ser Arys had paid with his life’s blood, Myrcella with an\near.</p>\n<p>Only Ser Gerold Dayne had escaped unscathed. Darkstar. If Myrcella’s\nhorse had not shied at the last instant, his longsword would have opened\nher from chest to waist instead just taking off her ear. Dayne was her\nmost grievous sin, the one that Arianne most regretted. With one stroke\nof his sword, he had changed her botched plot into something foul and\nbloody. If the gods were good, by now Obara Sand had treed him in his\nmountain fastness and put an end to him.</p>\n<p>She said as much to Daemon Sand that first night, as they made camp.\n\"Be careful what you pray for, princess,\" he replied. \"Darkstar could\nput an end to Lady Obara just as easily.\"</p>\n<p>\"She has Areo Hotah with her.\" Prince Doran’s captain of guards had\ndispatched Ser Arys Oakheart with a single blow, though the Kingsguard\nwere supposed to be the finest knights in all the realm. \"No man can\nstand against Hotah.\"</p>\n<p>\"Is that what Darkstar is? A man?\" Ser Daemon grimaced. \"A man would\nnot have done what he did to Princess Myrcella. Ser Gerold is more a\nviper than your uncle ever was. Prince Oberyn could see that he was\npoison, he said so more than once. It’s just a pity that he never got\naround to killing him.\"</p>\n<p>Poison, thought Arianne. Yes. Pretty poison, though. That was how\nhe’d fooled her. Gerold Dayne was hard and cruel, but so fair to look\nupon that the princess had not believed half the tales she’d heard of\nhim. Pretty boys had ever been her weakness, particularly the ones who\nwere dark and dangerous as well. That was before, when I was just a\ngirl, she told herself. I am a woman now, my father’s daughter. I have\nlearned that lesson.</p>\n<p>Come break of day, they were off again. Elia Sand led the way, her\nblack braid flying behind her as she raced across the dry, cracked\nplains and up into the hills. The girl was mad for horses, which might\nbe why she often smelled like one, to the despair of her mother.\nSometimes Arianne felt sorry for Ellaria. Four girls, and every one of\nthem her father’s daughter.</p>\n<p>The rest of the party kept a more sedate pace. The princess found\nherself riding beside Ser Daemon, remembering other rides when they were\nyounger, rides that often ended in embraces. When she found herself\nstealing glances at him, tall and gallant in the saddle, Arianne\nreminded herself that she was heir to Dorne, and him no more than her\nshield. \"Tell me what you know of this Jon Connington,\" she\ncommanded.</p>\n<p>\"He’s dead,\" said Daemon Sand. \"He died in the Disputed Lands. Of\ndrink, I’ve heard it said.\"</p>\n<p>\"So a dead drunk leads this army?\"</p>\n<p>\"Perhaps this Jon Connington is a son of that one. Or just some\nclever sellsword who has taken on a dead man’s name.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or he never died at all.\" Could Connington have been pretending to\nbe dead for all these years? That would require patience worthy of her\nfather. The thought made Arianne uneasy. Treating with a man that subtle\ncould be perilous. \"What was he like before he… before he died?\"</p>\n<p>\"I was a boy at Godsgrace when he was sent into exile. I never knew\nthe man.\"</p>\n<p>\"Then tell me what you’ve heard of him from others.\"</p>\n<p>\"As my princess commands. Connington was Lord of Griffin’s Roost when\nGriffin’s Roost was still a lordship worth the having. Prince Rhaegar’s\nsquire, or one of them. Later Prince Rhaegar’s friend and companion. The\nMad King named him Hand during Robert’s Rebellion, but he was defeated\nat Stoney Sept in the Battle of the Bells, and Robert slipped away. King\nAerys was wroth, and sent Connington into exile. There he died.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or not.\" Prince Doran had told her all of that. There must be more.\n\"Those are just the things he did. I know all that. What sort of man was\nhe? Honest and honorable, venal and grasping, proud?\"</p>\n<p>\"Proud, for a certainty. Even arrogant. A faithful friend to Rhaegar,\nbut prickly with others. Robert was his liege, but I’ve heard it said\nthat Connington chafed at serving such a lord. Even then, Robert was\nknown to be fond of wine and whores.\"</p>\n<p>\"No whores for Lord Jon, then?\"</p>\n<p>\"I could not say. Some men keep their whoring secret.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did he have a wife? A paramour?\"</p>\n<p>Ser Daemon shrugged. \"Not that I have ever heard.\"</p>\n<p>That was troubling too. Ser Arys Oakheart had broken his vows for\nher, but it did not sound as if Jon Connington could be similarly\nswayed. Can I match such a man with words alone?</p>\n<p>The princess lapsed into silence, all the while pondering what she\nwould find at journey’s end. That night when they made camp, she crept\ninto the tent she shared with Jayne Ladybright and Elia Sand and slipped\nthe bit of parchment out of her sleeve to read the words again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>To Prince Doran of House Martell,</em><br />\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote-center\">\n<p>You will remember me, I pray.I knew your sister well,and was a leal\nservant of your good-brother.I grieve for them as you do.I did not die,\nno more than did your sister’s son.To save his life we kept him\nhidden,but the time for hiding is done. A dragon has returned to\nWesteros to claim his birthright and seek vengeance for his father, and\nfor the princess Elia, his mother.In her name I turn to Dorne.Do not\nforsake us.</p>\n\n</blockquote> Jon Connington<br />\nLord of Griffin’s Roost<br />\nHand of the True King</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Arianne read the letter thrice, then rolled it up and tucked it back\ninto her sleeve. A dragon has returned to Westeros, but not the dragon\nmy father was expecting. Nowhere in the words was there a mention of\nDaenerys Stormborn… nor of Prince Quentyn, her brother, who had been\nsent to seek the dragon queen. The princess remembered how her father\nhad pressed the onyx cyvasse piece into her palm, his voice hoarse and\nlow as he confessed his plan. A long and perilous voyage, with an\nuncertain welcome at its end, he had said. He has gone to bring us back\nour heart’s desire. Vengeance. Justice. Fire and blood.</p>\n<p>Fire and blood was what Jon Connington (if indeed it was him) was\noffering as well. Or was it? \"He comes with sellswords, but no dragons,\"\nPrince Doran had told her, the night the raven came. \"The Golden Company\nis the best and largest of the free companies, but ten thousand\nmercenaries cannot hope to win the Seven Kingdoms. Elia’s son… I would\nweep for joy if some part of my sister had survived, but what proof do\nwe have that this is Aegon?\" His voice broke when he said that. \"Where\nare the dragons?\" he asked. \"Where is Daenerys?\" and Arianne knew that\nhe was really saying, \"Where is my son?\"</p>\n<p>In the Boneway and the Prince’s Pass, two Dornish hosts had massed,\nand there they sat, sharpening their spears, polishing their armor,\ndicing, drinking, quarreling, their numbers dwindling by the day,\nwaiting, waiting, waiting for the Prince of Dorne to loose them on the\nenemies of House Martell. Waiting for the dragons. For fire and blood.\nFor me. One word from Arianne and those armies would march… so long as\nthat word wasdragon. If instead the word she sent was war, Lord Yronwood\nand Lord Fowler and their armies would remain in place. The Prince of\nDorne was nothing if not subtle; here warmeant wait.</p>\n<p>At mid-morning on the third day Ghost Hill loomed up before them, its\nchalk-white walls shining against the deep blue of the Sea of Dorne.\nFrom the square towers at the castle’s corners flew the banners of House\nToland; a green dragon biting its own tail, upon a golden field. The\nsun-and-spear of House Martell streamed atop the great central keep,\ngold and red and orange, defiant.</p>\n<p>Ravens had flown ahead to warn Lady Toland of their coming, so the\ncastle gates were open, and Nymella’s eldest daughter rode forth with\nher steward to meet them near the bottom of the hill. Tall and fierce,\nwith a blaze of bright red hair tumbling about her shoulders, Valena\nToland greeted Arianne with a shout of, \"Come at last, have you? How\nslow are those horses?\"</p>\n<p>\"Swift enough to outrun yours to the castle gates.\"</p>\n<p>\"We will see about that.\" Valena wheeled her big red around and put\nher heels into him, and the race was on, through the dusty lanes of the\nvillage at the bottom of the hill, as chickens and villagers alike\nscrambled out of their path. Arianne was three horse lengths behind by\nthe time she got her mare up to a gallop, but had closed to one halfway\nup the slope. The two of them were side-by-side as they thundered\ntowards the gatehouse, but five yards from the gates Elia Sand came\nflying from the cloud of dust behind them to rush past both of them on\nher black filly.</p>\n<p>\"Are you half horse, child?\" Valena asked, laughing, in the yard.\n\"Princess, did you bring a stable girl?\"</p>\n<p>\"I’m Elia,\" the girl announced. \"Lady Lance.\"</p>\n<p>Whoever hung that name on her has much to answer for. Like as not it\nhad been Prince Oberyn, though, and the Red Viper had never answered to\nanyone but himself.</p>\n<p>\"The girl jouster,\" Valena said. \"Yes, I’ve heard of you. Since you\nwere the first to the yard, you’ve won the honor of watering and\nbridling the horses.\"</p>\n<p>\"And after that find the bath house,\" said Princess Arianne. Elia was\nchalk and dust from heels to hair.</p>\n<p>That night Arianne and her knights supped with Lady Nymella and her\ndaughters in the great hall of the castle. Teora, the younger girl, had\nthe same red hair as her sister, but elsewise could not have been more\ndifferent. Short, plump, and so shy she might have passed for a mute,\nshe displayed more interest in the spiced beef and honeyed duck than in\nthe comely young knights at the table, and seemed content to let her\nlady mother and her sister speak for House Toland.</p>\n<p>\"We have heard the same tales here that you have heard at Sunspear,\"\nLady Nymella told them as her serving man poured the wine. \"Sellswords\nlanding on Cape Wrath, castles under siege or being taken, crops seized\nor burned. Where these men come from and who they are, no one is\ncertain.\"</p>\n<p>\"Pirates and adventurers, we heard at first,\" said Valena. \"Then it\nwas supposed to be the Golden Company. Now it’s said to be Jon\nConnington, the Mad King’s Hand, come back from the grave to reclaim his\nbirthright. Whoever it is, Griffin’s Roost has fallen to them. Rain\nHouse, Crow’s Nest, Mistwood, even Greenstone on its island. All\ntaken.\"</p>\n<p>Arianne’s thoughts went at once to her sweet Spotted Slyva. \"Who\nwould want Greenstone? Was there a battle?\"</p>\n<p>\"Not as we have heard, but all the tales are garbled.\"</p>\n<p>\"Tarth has fallen too, some fisherfolk will tell you,\" said Valena.\n\"These sellswords now hold most of Cape Wrath and half the Stepstones.\nWe hear talk of elephants in the rainwood.\"</p>\n<p>\"Elephants?\" Arianne did not know what to think of that. \"Are you\ncertain? Not dragons?\"</p>\n<p>\"Elephants,\" Lady Nymella said firmly.</p>\n<p>\"And krakens off the Broken Arm, pulling under crippled galleys,\"\nsaid Valena. \"The blood draws them to the surface, our maester claims.\nThere are bodies in the water. A few have washed up on our shores. And\nthat’s not half of it. A new pirate king has set up on Torturer’s Deep.\nThe Lord of the Waters, he styles himself. This one has real warships,\nthree-deckers, monstrous large. You were wise not to come by sea. Since\nthe Redwyne fleet passed through the Stepstones, those waters are\ncrawling with strange sails, all the way north to the Straights of Tarth\nand Shipbreaker’s Bay. Myrmen, Volantenes, Lyseni, even reavers from the\nIron Islands. Some have entered the Sea of Dorne to land men on the\nsouth shore of Cape Wrath. We found a good fast ship for you, as your\nfather commanded, but even so… be careful.\"</p>\n<p>It is true, then. Arianne wanted to ask after her brother, but her\nfather had urged her to watch every word. If these ships had not brought\nQuentyn home again with his dragon queen, best not to mention him. Only\nher father and a few of his most trusted men knew about her brother’s\nmission to Slaver’s Bay. Lady Toland and her daughters were not amongst\nthem. If it were Quentyn, he would have brought Daenerys back to Dorne,\nsurely. Why would he risk a landing on Cape Wrath, amongst the\nstormlords?</p>\n<p>\"Is Dorne at risk?\" Lady Nymella asked. \"I confess, each time I see a\nstrange sail my heart leaps to my throat. What if these ships turn\nsouth? The best part of the Toland strength is with Lord Yronwood in the\nBoneway. Who will defend Ghost Hill if these strangers land upon our\nshores? Should I call my men home?\"</p>\n<p>\"Your men are needed where they are, my lady,\" Daemon Sand assured\nher. Arianne was quick to nod. Any other counsel could well lead to Lord\nYronwood’s host unravelling like an old tapestry as each man rushed home\nto defend his own lands against supposed enemies who might or might not\never come. \"Once we know beyond a doubt whether these be friends or\nfoes, my father will know what to do,\" the princess said.</p>\n<p>It was then that pasty, pudgy Teora raised her eyes from the\ncreamcakes on her plate. \"It is dragons.\"</p>\n<p>\"Dragons?\" said her mother. \"Teora, don’t be mad.\"</p>\n<p>\"I’m not. They’re coming.\"</p>\n<p>\"How could you possibly know that?\" her sister asked, with a note of\nscorn in her voice.</p>\n<p>\"One of your little dreams?\"</p>\n<p>Teora gave a tiny nod, chin trembling. \"They were dancing. In my\ndream. And everywhere the dragons danced the people died.\"</p>\n<p>\"Seven save us.\" Lady Nymella gave an exasperated sigh.</p>\n<p>\"If you did not eat so many creamcakes you would not have such\ndreams. Rich foods are not for girls your age, when your humors are so\nunbalanced. Maester Toman says — \"</p>\n<p>\"I hate Maester Toman,\" Teora said. Then she bolted from the table,\nleaving her lady mother to make apologies for her.</p>\n<p>\"Be gentle with her, my lady,\" Arianne said. \"I remember when I was\nher age. My father despaired of me, I’m sure.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can attest to that.\" Ser Daemon took a sip of wine and said,\n\"House Toland has a dragon on its banners.\"</p>\n<p>\"A dragon eating its own tail, aye,\" Valena said. \"From the days of\nAegon’s Conquest. He did not conquer here. Elsewhere he burned his foes,\nhim and his sisters, but here we melted away before them, leaving only\nstone and sand for them to burn. And round and round the dragons went,\nsnapping at their tails for want of any other food, till they were tied\nin knots.\"</p>\n<p>\"Our forebears played their part in that,\" Lady Nymella said proudly.\n\"Bold deeds were done, and brave men died. All of it was written down by\nthe maesters who served us. We have books, if my princess would like to\nknow more.\"</p>\n<p>\"Some other time, perhaps,\" said Arianne.</p>\n<p>As Ghost Hill slept that night, the princess donned a hooded cloak\nagainst the chill and and walked the castle battlements to clear her\nthoughts. Daemon Sand found her leaning on a parapet and gazing out to\nsea, where the moon was dancing on the water. \"Princess,\" he said. \"You\nought to be abed.\"</p>\n<p>\"I could say the same of you.\" Arianne turned to gaze upon his face.\nA good face, she decided. The boy I knew has become a handsome man. His\neyes were as blue as a desert sky, his hair the light brown of the sands\nthey had just crossed. A close-cropped beard followed the thin of a\nstrong jaw, but could not quite hide the dimples when he smiled. I\nalways loved his smile.</p>\n<p>The Bastard of Godsgrace was one of Dorne’s finest swords as well, as\nmight be expected from one who had been Prince Oberyn’s squire and had\nreceived his knighthood from the Red Viper himself. Some said that he\nhad been her uncle’s lover too, though seldom to his face. Arianne did\nnot know the truth of that. He had been her lover, though. At fourteen\nshe had given him her maidenhead. Daemon had not been much older, so\ntheir couplings had been as clumsy as they were ardent. Still, it had\nbeen sweet.</p>\n<p>Arianne gave him her most seductive smile. \"We might share a bed\ntogether.\"</p>\n<p>Ser Daemon’s face was stone. \"Have you forgotten, princess? I am\nbastard born.\" He took her hand in his. \"If I am unworthy of this hand,\nhow can I be worthy of your cunt?\"</p>\n<p>She snatched her hand away. \"You deserve a slap for that.\"</p>\n<p>\"My face is yours. Do what you will.\"</p>\n<p>\"What I will you will not, it seems. So be it. Talk with me instead.\nCould this truly be Prince Aegon?\"</p>\n<p>\"Gregor Clegane ripped Aegon out of Elia’s arms and smashed his head\nagainst a wall,\" Ser Daemon said. \"If Lord Connington’s prince has a\ncrushed skull, I will believe that Aegon Targaryen has returned from the\ngrave. Elsewise, no. This is some feigned boy, no more. A sellsword’s\nploy to win support.\"</p>\n<p>My father fears the same. \"If not, though… if this truly is Jon\nConnington, if the boy is Rhaegar’s son… \"</p>\n<p>\"Are you hoping that he is, or that he’s not?\"</p>\n<p>\"I… it would give great joy to my father if Elia’s son were still\nalive. He loved his sister well.\"</p>\n<p>\"It was you I asked about, not your father.\"</p>\n<p>So it was. \"I was seven when Elia died. They say I held her daughter\nRhaenys once, when I was too young to remember. Aegon will be a stranger\nto me, whether true or false.\" The princess paused. \"We looked for\nRhaegar’s sister, not his son.\" Her father had confided in Ser Daemon\nwhen he chose him as his daughter’s shield; with him at least she could\nspeak freely. \"I would sooner it were Quentyn who’d returned.\"</p>\n<p>\"Or so you say,\" said Daemon Sand. \"Good night, princess.\" He bowed\nto her, and left her standing there.</p>\n<p>What did he mean by that? Arianne watched him walk away. What sort of\nsister would I be, if I did not want my brother back? It was true, she\nhad resented Quentyn for all those years that she had thought their\nfather meant to name him as his heir in place of her, but that had\nturned out to be just a misunderstanding. She was the heir to Dorne, she\nhad her father’s word on that. Quentyn would have his dragon queen,\nDaenerys.</p>\n<p>In Sunspear hung a portrait of the Princess Daenerys who had come to\nDorne to marry one of Arianne’s forebears. In her younger days Arianne\nhad spent hours gazing at it, back when she was just a pudgy\nflat-chested girl on the cusp of maidenhood who prayed every night for\nthe gods to make her pretty. A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen\ncame to Dorne to make a peace. Now another comes to make a war, and my\nbrother will be her king and consort.King Quentyn. Why did that sound so\nsilly?</p>\n<p>Almost as silly as Quentyn riding on a dragon. Her brother was an\nearnest boy,well-behaved and dutiful, but dull. And plain, so plain. The\ngods had given Arianne the beauty she had prayed for, but Quentyn must\nhave prayed for something else. His head was overlarge and sort of\nsquare, his hair the color of dried mud. His shoulders slumped as well,\nand he was too thick about the middle. He looks too much like\nFather.</p>\n<p>\"I love my brother,\" said Arianne, though only the moon could hear\nher. Though if truth be told, she scarcely knew him. Quentyn had been\nfostered by Lord Anders of House Yronwood, the Bloodroyal, the son of\nLord Ormond Yronwood and grandson of Lord Edgar. In his youth her uncle\nOberyn had fought a duel with Edgar, had given him a wound that\nmortified and killed him. Afterward men called him ‘the Red Viper,’ and\nspoke of poison on his blade. The Yronwoods were an ancient house, proud\nand powerful. Before the coming of the Rhoynar they had been kings over\nhalf of Dorne, with domains that dwarfed those of House Martell. Blood\nfeud and rebellion would surely have followed Lord Edgar’s death, had\nnot her father acted at once. The Red Viper went to Oldtown, thence\nacross to the narrow sea to Lys, though none dared call it exile. And in\ndue time, Quentyn was given to Lord Anders to foster as a sign of trust.\nThat helped to heal the breach between Sunspear and the Yronwoods, but\nit had opened new ones between Quentyn and the Sand Snakes… and Arianne\nhad always been closer to her cousins than to her distant brother.</p>\n<p>\"We are still the same blood, though,\" she whispered. \"Of course I\nwant my brother home. I do.\" The wind off the sea was raising\ngooseprickles all up and down her arms. Arianne pulled her cloak about\nherself, and went off to seek her bed.</p>\n<p>Their ship was called the Peregrine. They sailed upon the morning\ntide. The gods were good to them, the sea calm. Even with good winds,\nthe crossing took a day and a night. Jayne Ladybright grew greensick and\nspent most of the voyage spewing, which Elia Sand seemed to find\nhilarious. \"Someone needs to spank that child,\" Joss Hood was heard to\nsay… but Elia was amongst those who heard him say it.</p>\n<p>\"I am almost a woman grown, ser,\" she responded haughtily. \"I’ll let\nyou spank me, though… but first you’ll need to tilt with me, and knock\nme off my horse.\"</p>\n<p>\"We are on a ship, and without horses,\" Joss replied.</p>\n<p>\"And ladies do not joust,\" insisted Ser Garibald Shells, a far more\nserious and proper young man than his companion.</p>\n<p>\"I do. I’m Lady Lance.\"</p>\n<p>Arianne had heard enough. \"You may be a lance, but you are no lady.\nGo below and stay there till we reach land.\"</p>\n<p>Elsewise the crossing was uneventful. At dusk they spied a galley in\nthe distance, her oars rising and falling against the evening stars, but\nshe was moving away from them, and soon dwindled and was gone. Arianne\nplayed a game of cyvasse with Ser Daemon, and another one with Garibald\nShells, and somehow managed to lose both. Ser Garibald was kind enough\nto say that she played a gallant game, but Daemon mocked her. \"You have\nother pieces beside the dragon, princess. Try moving them sometime.\"</p>\n<p>\"I like the dragon.\" She wanted to slap the smile off his face. Or\nkiss it off, perhaps. The man was as smug as he was comely. Of all the\nknights in Dorne, why did my father chose this one to be my shield? He\nknows our history. \"It is just a game. Tell me of Prince Viserys.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Beggar King?\" Ser Daemon seemed surprised.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone says that Prince Rhaegar was beautiful. Was Viserys\nbeautiful as well?\"</p>\n<p>\"I suppose. He was Targaryen. I never saw the man.\"</p>\n<p>The secret pact that Prince Doran had made all those years called for\nArianne to be wed to Prince Viserys, not Quentyn to Daenerys. It had all\ncome undone on the Dothraki sea, when he was murdered. Crowned with a\npot of molten gold. \"He was killed by a Dothraki khal,\" said Arianne.\n\"The dragon queen’s own husband.\"</p>\n<p>\"So I’ve heard. What of it?\"</p>\n<p>\"Just… why did Daenerys let it happen? Viserys was her brother. All\nthat remained of her own blood.\"</p>\n<p>\"The Dothraki are a savage folk. Who can know why they kill? Perhaps\nViserys wiped his arse with the wrong hand.\"</p>\n<p>Perhaps, thought Arianne, or perhaps Daenerys realized that once her\nbrother was crowned and wed to me, she would be doomed to spend the rest\nof her life sleeping in a tent and smelling like a horse. \"She is the\nMad King’s daughter,\" the princess said. \"How do we do know — \"</p>\n<p>\"We cannot know,\" Ser Daemon said. \"We can only hope.\"</p>"},{"title":"Android上的生命周期监控","comments":0,"date":"2018-07-23T05:36:11.000Z","_content":"做Android开发总是避免不了要处理各种生命周期，那么有没有什么优雅的方法呢？现在我就记录几种方法。\n<!-- more -->\n# Lifecycle  \n`Lifecycle`是Google在[Jetpack](https://developer.android.google.cn/jetpack/)中提出的，在包[`android.arch.lifecycle`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/arch/lifecycle/package-summary.html)下面，如果使用的是suppor包中的SupportActivity或者FragmentActivity已经继承了Lifecycle。使用的方法如下：\n```kotlin\nclass myFragmentActivity(val fragmentActivity: FragmentActivity) : LifecycleObserver {\n    init {\n     //在这里注册一下\n      fragmentActivity.lifecycle.addObserver(this)\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME)\n    fun onResume(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_RESUME\")\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_PAUSE)\n    fun onPause(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_PAUSE\")\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_STOP)\n    fun onStop(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_STOP\")\n    }\n    @OnLifecycleEvent(Lifecycle.Event.ON_DESTROY)\n    fun onDestroy(){\n        Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"ON_DESTROY\")\n    }\n}\n```\n这样就可以很方便去管理生命周期，也可以和原来的activity的方法解耦。也可以通过LifecycleOwner来管理生命周期\n```kotlin\nclass MyActivity : Activity(), LifecycleOwner {\n    lateinit var mLifecycleRegistry: LifecycleRegistry\n\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n\n        mLifecycleRegistry = LifecycleRegistry(this)\n        mLifecycleRegistry.markState(Lifecycle.State.CREATED)\n    }\n\n    override fun onStart() {\n        super.onStart()\n        mLifecycleRegistry.markState(Lifecycle.State.STARTED)\n    }\n\n    //这里得到的就是生命周期的结果\n    override fun getLifecycle(): Lifecycle = mLifecycleRegistry\n}\n```\n这里不详细赘述里面的细节，只是记录一下使用的方法，有关细节可以查看官方文档。\n\n# FragmentLifecycleCallbacks\n如果使用的是fragment，那么这里提供另一种获取生命周期的方法，通过`FragmentLifecycleCallbacks`可以获取到fragment的生命周期回调\n```kotlin\n  fragment.requireFragmentManager().registerFragmentLifecycleCallbacks(object : FragmentManager.FragmentLifecycleCallbacks() {\n    override fun onFragmentResumed(fm: FragmentManager, f: Fragment) {\n      Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"onFragmentResumed\")\n    }\n\n    override fun onFragmentPaused(fm: FragmentManager, f: Fragment) {\n      Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"onFragmentPaused\")\n    }\n\n    override fun onFragmentStopped(fm: FragmentManager, f: Fragment) {\n      Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"onFragmentStopped\")\n      //fragment.requireFragmentManager().unregisterFragmentLifecycleCallbacks(this)\n    }\n\n    override fun onFragmentDestroyed(fm: FragmentManager, f: Fragment) {\n      Timber.tag(\"xx\").i(\"onFragmentDestroyed\")\n    }\n}, true)\n```\n所以，通过为activity添加一个空白的fragment也是一种方法，然后fragment就可以获取到activity的生命周期了，Glide就是通过添加一个fragment来管理生命周期的。\n\n# ActivityLifecycleCallbacks\n如果要全局管理生命周期有没有什么办法呢？当然还是有的，可以设置全局的Application，然后在application里面注册监听，就可以处理所有的activity的生命周期了。记得及时释放掉。\n```kotlin\nregisterActivityLifecycleCallbacks(object : Application.ActivityLifecycleCallbacks {\n    override fun onActivityPaused(activity: Activity?) {\n    }\n\n    override fun onActivityResumed(activity: Activity?) {\n    }\n\n    override fun

}\n})\n```\n\n就记录这么多的方法，然后基于上面的进行封装处理就可以了，如果你有更好的方法，也欢迎来一起讨论。\n","source":"_posts/Android上的生命周期监控.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Android上的生命周期监控\ntags: Android\ncomments: false\ndate: 2018-07-23

PorterDuffXfermode\n最开始想的是使用PorterDuffXfermode来处理，因为这种方式其实很快的，但是，虽然这种方式可以用来处理图片，但是无法满足获取图片边界的需求。\n代码如下：\n```java\n    public static Bitmap cutStickerBitmap(String name, Context context, Bitmap bitmap) {\n        Calendar calendar = Calendar.getInstance();\n        Bitmap bit = Bitmap.createBitmap(bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight(), Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);\n        bit.eraseColor(Color.WHITE);\n        Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bit);\n\n        Paint paint = new Paint();\n        paint.setXfermode(new PorterDuffXfermode(PorterDuff.Mode.DST_IN));\n\n        canvas.drawBitmap(bitmap, 0, 0, paint);\n        Paint paintRect = new Paint();\n        paintRect.setColor(Color.RED);\n        paintRect.setAntiAlias(true);\n        paintRect.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);\n        paintRect.setStrokeWidth(4);\n        Rect rect = new Rect();\n        //画一个框表示边界\n        rect.set(0, 0, bitmap.getWidth(), bitmap.getHeight());\n        canvas.drawRect(rect, paintRect);\n        Log.i(\"xx\", \" 运行时间 cutStickerBitmap \" + (Calendar.getInstance().getTimeInMillis() - calendar.getTimeInMillis()));\n        return bit;\n    }\n```\n代码处理的时间，可以看到时间很快，可惜不符合需求：\n![](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8433-cc2aeb6b5781d17d.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n处理的结果如下：

自己写算法的话，需要自己评估你自己的需求和结果。一开始，为了防止图形是不连续的，我采取的思路是从图片四周来获取边界。思路如图：\n![](https://upload-images.jianshu.io/upload_images/8433-7aa7fbf20e14fd18.png?imageMogr2/auto-orient/strip%7CimageView2/2/w/1240)\n这么做的确是可以保证百分百正确的，但是这么做有一个问题，那就是因为每次得到的图片分辨率不一样，在有的时候处理一次需要10s以上，这实在是太慢了。\n\n后来仔细观察之后发现，其实不需要那么严格的，因为得到的所有的图形都是连续的，所以新的算法就是从中间开始处理的。\n

webp的。那么如何处理呢？记录一下，不然坑都白踩了。本质上webp和gif都是一组图片组成的连续图片，如果要单独解析每一帧怎么办呢。\n<!-- more -->\n# Android支持\n如果要拿到webp的第一帧，在Android以上是可以直接使用如下这种方法，默认取的是第一帧，但是，这种方法只有在8.0及以上才有用。\n```java\n  Bitmap  bitmap =  BitmapFactory.decodeFile(filename);\n```\n\n# fresco控制animated webp\n添加`fresco`支持webp的方法是：\n```gradle\n  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:fresco:1.13.0'\n  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:1.13.0'\n//implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-gif:1.13.0'\n```\n添加之后就可以直接加载webp了，也可以设置自动开始播放，如下：\n```java\n  ImageRequestBuilder imageRequestBuilder = ImageRequestBuilder.newBuilderWithSource(uri);\n  PipelineDraweeControllerBuilder builder = Fresco.newDraweeControllerBuilder();\n  builder.setImageRequest(imageRequestBuilder.build());\n  builder.setAutoPlayAnimations(true);\n  builder.setControllerListener(new BaseControllerListener<ImageInfo>() {\n    @Override\n    public void onFinalImageSet(String id, ImageInfo imageInfo, Animatable animatable) {\n    //加载完成的监听\n    }\n  });\n  simpleDraweeView.setController(builder.build());\n```\n到这一步都很简单，但是要加载webp的第一帧咋办呢？\n先来一种最简单的，类似于`BitmapFactory.decodeFile()`，`fresco`中也有一个方法，同样的，这种方法也是仅支持8.0及以上\n```java\n  Bitmap bitmap = WebpSupportStatus\n                  .loadWebpBitmapFactoryIfExists()\n                  .decodeFile(filename, new BitmapFactory.Options());\n```\n那么还有什么办法呢？还可以使用下面这种方法。这种方法是用的是`fresco`的订阅者，可以处理加载之后的数据，可以拿到webp的每一帧，然后做你想要的处理，[官网链接](https://frescolib.org/docs/datasources-datasubscribers.html)。\n```java\n  ImageDecodeOptionsBuilder decodeOptionsBuilder = new ImageDecodeOptionsBuilder();\n  decodeOptionsBuilder.setDecodeAllFrames(true);\n  decodeOptionsBuilder.setBitmapConfig(Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);\n  ImagePipelineFactory.getInstance()\n          .getImagePipeline()\n          .fetchDecodedImage(ImageRequestBuilder\n                          .newBuilderWithSource(Uri.fromFile(new File(filename)))\n                          .setImageDecodeOptions(new ImageDecodeOptions(decodeOptionsBuilder))\n                          .build()\n                  , context)\n          .subscribe(new BaseDataSubscriber<CloseableReference<CloseableImage>>() {\n              @Override\n              protected void onNewResultImpl(DataSource<CloseableReference<CloseableImage>> dataSource) {\n                  if (dataSource.getResult().get() instanceof CloseableAnimatedImage) {\n                      CloseableAnimatedImage animatedImage = (CloseableAnimatedImage) dataSource.getResult().get();\n                      if (animatedImage.getImage().getFrameCount() > 0) {\n                          Bitmap frameBitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(animatedImage.getWidth(), animatedImage.getHeight(), Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888);\n                          //添加透明通道\n                          frameBitmap.eraseColor(Color.TRANSPARENT);\n                          frameBitmap.setHasAlpha(true);\n                          animatedImage.getImage().getFrame(0).renderFrame(animatedImage.getWidth(), animatedImage.getHeight(), frameBitmap);\n                          try {\n                              //保存成文件\n                              File file = new File(filename);\n                              File outFile = new File(file.getParent(), file.getName() + \".png\");\n                              FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(outFile);\n                              frameBitmap.compress(Bitmap.CompressFormat.PNG, 100, out);\n                              out.flush();\n                              out.close();\n\n                          } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n                              e.printStackTrace();\n                          } catch (IOException e) {\n                              e.printStackTrace();\n                          }\n                      }\n                  }\n\n              }\n\n              @Override\n              protected void onFailureImpl(DataSource<CloseableReference<CloseableImage>> dataSource) {\n\n              }\n          }, CallerThreadExecutor.getInstance());\n```\n需要注意的地方有三个：\n1. 下面这种方法默认解出来的bitmap是不带透明通道的，需要你处理一遍。\n2. 第二个是，这种方法拿到的bitmap离开这个方法之后就有可能会被回收掉，如果你要长久使用的话，建议自己再copy一遍，我为了节省解压的时间，我直接保存成为一张png的文件，然后去使用，你也可以直接copy出来bitmap去使用的。\n3. 这种方法可以解压出来每一帧，选择你需要帧数来处理就可以了。\n\n# Glide4控制GIF\n关于GIF，目前支持的主流的加载库只有`Glide`和`fresco`，`Picasso`并不默认支持。\n\n在这里顺便记录一下Glide4.0加载Gif的并控制播放的方式。在Glide3中`GlideDrawableImageViewTarget `已经被废弃了，可以使用`GifDrawable`来控制，里面有控制GIF的方法，也可以拿到GIF的每一帧来处理，定义好的接口方法就在那里，不离不弃，看下接口就知道了。\n```java\npublic void setStartPlayGif(final boolean startPlayGif) {\n    Glide.with(context)\n        .asGif()\n        .load(\"gifFile\")\n        .into(new ImageViewTarget<GifDrawable>(imageView) {\n            @Override\n            protected void setResource(@Nullable GifDrawable resource) {\n                if (resource != null) {\n                    if(startPlayGif){\n                        //resource.setLoopCount(1);\n                        view.setImageDrawable(resource);\n                    } else {\n                        view.setImageBitmap(resource.getFirstFrame());\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        });\n}\n```\n","source":"_posts/Android加载animated-webp的控制和Glide加载GIF.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Android加载animated-webp的控制和Glide加载GIF\ntags: Android\ncomments: false\ndate: 2019-03-08

下面这种方法默认解出来的bitmap是不带透明通道的，需要你处理一遍。\n2. 第二个是，这种方法拿到的bitmap离开这个方法之后就有可能会被回收掉，如果你要长久使用的话，建议自己再copy一遍，我为了节省解压的时间，我直接保存成为一张png的文件，然后去使用，你也可以直接copy出来bitmap去使用的。\n3. 这种方法可以解压出来每一帧，选择你需要帧数来处理就可以了。\n\n# Glide4控制GIF\n关于GIF，目前支持的主流的加载库只有`Glide`和`fresco`，`Picasso`并不默认支持。\n\n在这里顺便记录一下Glide4.0加载Gif的并控制播放的方式。在Glide3中`GlideDrawableImageViewTarget `已经被废弃了，可以使用`GifDrawable`来控制，里面有控制GIF的方法，也可以拿到GIF的每一帧来处理，定义好的接口方法就在那里，不离不弃，看下接口就知道了。\n```java\npublic void setStartPlayGif(final boolean startPlayGif) {\n    Glide.with(context)\n        .asGif()\n        .load(\"gifFile\")\n        .into(new ImageViewTarget<GifDrawable>(imageView) {\n            @Override\n            protected void setResource(@Nullable GifDrawable resource) {\n                if (resource != null) {\n                    if(startPlayGif){\n                        //resource.setLoopCount(1);\n                        view.setImageDrawable(resource);\n                    } else {\n                        view.setImageBitmap(resource.getFirstFrame());\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        });\n}\n```\n","slug":"Android加载animated-webp的控制和Glide加载GIF","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.497Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vks60012pmnke5dgeuz8","content":"<p>因为动态的webp使用的也越来越多了，所以这里记录一种加载处理的办法。目前常用的Android图片加载库，只有<code>fresco</code>是可以直接加载animated\nwebp的。那么如何处理呢？记录一下，不然坑都白踩了。本质上webp和gif都是一组图片组成的连续图片，如果要单独解析每一帧怎么办呢。\n<span

1.\n下面这种方法默认解出来的bitmap是不带透明通道的，需要你处理一遍。 2.\n第二个是，这种方法拿到的bitmap离开这个方法之后就有可能会被回收掉，如果你要长久使用的话，建议自己再copy一遍，我为了节省解压的时间，我直接保存成为一张png的文件，然后去使用，你也可以直接copy出来bitmap去使用的。\n3. 这种方法可以解压出来每一帧，选择你需要帧数来处理就可以了。</p>\n<h1 id=\"glide4控制gif\">Glide4控制GIF</h1>\n<p>关于GIF，目前支持的主流的加载库只有<code>Glide</code>和<code>fresco</code>，<code>Picasso</code>并不默认支持。</p>\n<p>在这里顺便记录一下Glide4.0加载Gif的并控制播放的方式。在Glide3中<code>GlideDrawableImageViewTarget</code>已经被废弃了，可以使用<code>GifDrawable</code>来控制，里面有控制GIF的方法，也可以拿到GIF的每一帧来处理，定义好的接口方法就在那里，不离不弃，看下接口就知道了。\n<figure

  Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .into(imageView);\n```\n但是，当你在加载图片之前对图片做处理，我们可以怎么做呢？比如我这样的需求，第一次显示的时候加载左边，点击之后加载右边，显然直接用Glide加载是不行的。下面介绍一些踩过的坑。\n![](/images/icon_spine_unselected_1.png)\n\n# 1. Transformation 变换\n通过内置的一些变换类，可以达到一些处理效果，[详情参考](https://muyangmin.github.io/glide-docs-cn/doc/transformations.html#%E5%86%85%E7%BD%AE%E7%B1%BB%E5%9E%8B)\n```java\n   Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .transform(new CircleCrop())\n      .into(imageView);\n```\n当然也可以通过自定义一些手段来达到目的，[详情参考](https://muyangmin.github.io/glide-docs-cn/doc/transformations.html#%E5%AE%9A%E5%88%B6%E5%8F%98%E6%8D%A2)\n```java\nimport android.graphics.Bitmap;\nimport android.support.annotation.NonNull;\n\nimport com.bumptech.glide.load.engine.bitmap_recycle.BitmapPool;\nimport com.bumptech.glide.load.resource.bitmap.BitmapTransformation;\n\nimport java.security.MessageDigest;\n\n/**\n * Created by JayChou on 2019/3/5.\n */\npublic class GlideSelectIcon extends BitmapTransformation {\n    private static final String ID = \"yourpackagename.GlideSelectIcon\";\n    private static final byte[] ID_BYTES = ID.getBytes(CHARSET);\n\n    private boolean isSelect = false;\n\n    @Override\n    protected Bitmap transform(@NonNull BitmapPool pool, @NonNull Bitmap toTransform, int outWidth, int outHeight) {\n        Bitmap bitmap;\n        if (isSelect) {\n            bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(toTransform, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, 0, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, toTransform.getHeight()); //对图片的高度的一半进行裁剪\n        } else {\n            bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(toTransform, 0, 0, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, toTransform.getHeight()); //对图片的高度的一半进行裁剪\n        }\n        pool.put(bitmap);\n        return bitmap;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isSelect() {\n        return isSelect;\n    }\n\n    public void setSelect(boolean select) {\n        isSelect = select;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object o) {\n        return o instanceof GlideSelectIcon;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int hashCode() {\n        return ID_BYTES.hashCode();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void updateDiskCacheKey(@NonNull MessageDigest messageDigest) {\n        messageDigest.update(ID_BYTES);\n    }\n}\n```\n```java\n   Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .transform(new GlideSelectIcon())\n      .into(imageView);\n```\n需要注意的是，上面的方法是会直接处理掉图片的，`updateDiskCacheKey` 和`hashCode ` 和 `equals `都只是帮你处理缓存key的。如果你需要自己处理缓存，那就更新这几个地方就可以了，如果你只需要缓存原图可以用`.diskCacheStrategy(DiskCacheStrategy.RESOURCE)`的策略。\n\n这里有一个坑需要注意的是，这货如果你不是更新缓存的话，那么就不会走`BitmapTransformation.transform() `这个方法，也就是说只有第一次加载和更新缓存的时候才会走这个方法，所以这是一次性处理的效果。但是每次都更新缓存的话又太费流量了，还有啥办法呢？\n# 2. [Target 变换](https://muyangmin.github.io/glide-docs-cn/doc/targets.html#%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8Etarget)\n我这边的需求恰好是需要每次都更新一边图片，但是我又不想每次都刷新缓存，那么怎么办呢？就可以使用加载后的图片处理方法`ViewTarget`。\n\n```java\nimport android.graphics.Bitmap;\nimport android.graphics.Canvas;\nimport android.graphics.PixelFormat;\nimport android.graphics.drawable.Drawable;\nimport android.support.annotation.Nullable;\nimport android.widget.ImageView;\n\nimport com.bumptech.glide.Glide;\nimport com.bumptech.glide.request.target.DrawableImageViewTarget;\n\n/**\n * Created by JayChou on 2019/3/6.\n */\npublic class GlideSelectDrawableImageViewTarget extends DrawableImageViewTarget {\n\n    private boolean isSelect = false;\n\n    public GlideSelectDrawableImageViewTarget(ImageView view, boolean isSelect) {\n        super(view);\n        Glide.with(view).clear(view);\n        this.isSelect = isSelect;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void setResource(@Nullable Drawable resource) {\n        if (resource != null) {\n            Bitmap toTransform = drawableToBitmap(resource);\n            Bitmap bitmap;\n            if (isSelect) {\n                bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(toTransform, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, 0, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, toTransform.getHeight()); //对图片的高度的一半进行裁剪\n            } else {\n                bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(toTransform, 0, 0, toTransform.getWidth() / 2, toTransform.getHeight()); //对图片的高度的一半进行裁剪\n            }\n            view.setImageBitmap(bitmap);\n        }\n    }\n\n    public Bitmap drawableToBitmap(Drawable drawable) {\n        // 取 drawable 的长宽\n        int w = drawable.getIntrinsicWidth();\n        int h = drawable.getIntrinsicHeight();\n\n        // 取 drawable 的颜色格式\n        Bitmap.Config config = drawable.getOpacity() != PixelFormat.OPAQUE ? Bitmap.Config.ARGB_8888\n                : Bitmap.Config.RGB_565;\n        // 建立对应 bitmap\n        Bitmap bitmap = Bitmap.createBitmap(w, h, config);\n        // 建立对应 bitmap 的画布\n        Canvas canvas = new Canvas(bitmap);\n        drawable.setBounds(0, 0, w, h);\n        // 把 drawable 内容画到画布中\n        drawable.draw(canvas);\n        return bitmap;\n    }\n}\n\n```\n然后添加到Glide中就可以了\n```java\n   Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .into(new GlideSelectDrawableImageViewTarget(imageView,true));\n```\n\n这里需要说明的地方是：\n我因为用的是`DrawableImageViewTarget`，所以自己把`drawable`转成了`Bitmap`来处理的，你也可以直接处理`drawable`。\n\n我每次都调用了一下`Glide.with(view).clear(view);`，是因为Glide在添加 `ViewTarget`之后，会针对当前的imageView做引用复用，所以除非你手动清理一遍ImagView的引用，否者每次新设置的`ViewTarget`都不会起作用，只会复用上一次的`ViewTarget`。\n\n这里踩了很长时间的坑，一直很奇怪的是`setResource`中的`isSelect`一直没有变化，排查了很久才发现这里，关于这一段的说明在[这里](https://muyangmin.github.io/glide-docs-cn/doc/targets.html#%E5%8F%96%E6%B6%88%E5%92%8C%E9%87%8D%E7%94%A8)。\n![](/images/glide官方文档截图Target.png)\n\n---\n第一个是因为缓存的问题卡住了，第二个是因为对象引用卡住了。以上就是关于这次的Glide踩坑记录，论官方文档全看完并理解的重要性。\n","source":"_posts/Glide4的一次踩坑记录.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Glide4的一次踩坑记录\ntags: Android\ncomments: false\ndate: 2019-03-06 15:15:45\n---\n如果你用图片加载库直接加载图片，并不需要做任何处理，那么，其实大多数时候你用任何加载库并没有太大的区别。一旦你需要处理各种各样的图片的时候，你就会遇到各种各样的问题了。这里记录一个关于Glide的问题，一下都是Glide4.9版本。\n<!--more-->\n在Glide中加载图片，可以很简单，类似于这样就可以了：\n```java\n   Glide.with(context)\n      .load(url)\n      .into(imageView);\n```\n但是，当你在加载图片之前对图片做处理，我们可以怎么做呢？比如我这样的需求，第一次显示的时候加载左边，点击之后加载右边，显然直接用Glide加载是不行的。下面介绍一些踩过的坑。\n![](/images/icon_spine_unselected_1.png)\n\n# 1.

woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.\n\nThe smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on the scent of prey.\n\nHalf-light filled the room, grey and gloomy. Shivering, she sat up in bed and ran a hand across her scalp. Stubble bristled against her palm. I need to shave before Izembaro sees. Mercy, I’m Mercy, and tonight I’ll be raped and murdered. Her true name was Mercedene, but Mercy was all anyone ever called her…\n<!--more-->\nExcept in dreams. She took a breath to quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of what she’d dreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it, though, and a full moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she ran.\n\nShe had fastened the shutters back so the morning sun might wake her. But there was no sun outside the window of Mercy’s little room, only a wall of shifting grey fog. The air had grown chilly… and a good thing, else she might have slept all day. It would be just like Mercy to sleep through her own rape.\n\nGooseprickles covered her legs. Her coverlet had twisted around her like a snake. She unwound it, threw the blanket to the bare plank floor and padded naked to the window. Braavos was lost in fog. She could see the green water of the little canal below, the cobbled stone street that ran beneath her building, two arches of the mossy bridge… but the far end of the bridge vanished in greyness, and of the buildings across the canal only a few vague lights remained. She heard a soft splash as a serpent boat emerged beneath the bridge’s central arch. “What hour?” Mercy called down to the man who stood by the snake’s uplifted tail, pushing her onward with his pole.\n\nThe waterman gazed up, searching for the voice. “Four, by the Titan’s roar.” His words echoed hollowly off the swirling green waters and the walls of unseen buildings.\n\nShe was not late, not yet, but she should not dawdle. Mercy was a happy soul and a hard worker, but seldom timely. That would not serve tonight. The envoy from Westeros was expected at the Gate this evening, and Izembaro would be in no mood to hear excuses, even if she served them up with a sweet smile.\n\nShe had filled her basin from the canal last night before she went to sleep, preferring the brackish water to the slimy green rainwater stewing in the cistern out back. Dipping a rough cloth, she washed herself head to heel, standing on one leg at a time to scrub her calloused feet. After that she found her razor. A bare scalp helped the wigs fit better, Izembaro claimed.\n\nShe shaved, donned her smallclothes, and slipped a shapeless brown wool dress down over her head. One of her stockings needed mending, she saw as she pulled it up. She would ask the Snapper for help; her own sewing was so wretched that the wardrobe mistress usually took pity on her. Else I could filtch a nicer pair from wardrobe. That was risky, though. Izembaro hated it when the mummers wore his costumes in the streets.Except for Wendeyne. Give Izembaro’s cock a little suck and a girl can wear any costume that she wants. Mercy was not so foolish as all that. Daena had warned her. “Girls who start down that road wind up on the Ship, where every man in the pit knows he can have any pretty thing he might see up on the stage, if his purse is plump enough.”\n\nHer boots were lumps of old brown leather mottled with saltstains and cracked from long wear, her belt a length of hempen rope dyed blue. She knotted it about her waist, and hung a knife on her right hip and a coin pouch on her left. Last of all she threw her cloak across her shoulders. It was a real mummer’s cloak, purple wool lined in red silk, with a hood to keep the rain off, and three secret pockets too. She’d hid some coins in one of those, an iron key in another, a blade in the last. A real blade, not a fruit knife like the one on her hip, but it did not belong to Mercy, no more than her other treasures did. The fruit knife belonged to Mercy. She was made for eating fruit, for smiling and joking, for working hard and doing as she was told.\n\n“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang as she descended the wooden stair to the street. The handrail was splintery, the steps steep, and there were five flights, but that was why she’d gotten the room so cheap. That, and Mercy’s smile. She might be bald and skinny, but Mercy had a pretty smile, and a certain grace. Even Izembaro agreed that she was graceful. She was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with feet instead of wings the way was longer. Braavos was a crooked city. The streets were crooked, the alleys were crookeder, and the canals were crookedest of all. Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the Ragman’s Road along the Outer Harbor, where she had the sea before her and the sky above, and a clear view across the Great Lagoon to the Arsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail her as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of tarry Ibbenese whalers and big-bellied Westerosi cogs. Mercy could not always understand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes she would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if they had the coin.\n\nThe long way also took her across the Bridge of Eyes with its carved stone faces. From the top of its span, she could look through the arches and see all the city: the green copper domes of the Hall of Truth, the masts rising like a forest from the Purple Harbor, the tall towers of the mighty, the golden thunderbolt turning on its spire atop the Sealord’s Palace… even the Titan’s bronze shoulders, off across the dark green waters. But that was only when the sun was shining down on Braavos. If the fog was thick there was nothing to see but grey, so today Mercy chose the shorter route to save some wear on her poor cracked boots.\n\nThe mists seemed to part before her and close up again as she passed. The cobblestones were wet and slick under her feet. She heard a cat yowl plaintively. Braavos was a good city for cats, and they roamed everywhere, especially at night. In the fog all cats are grey, Mercy thought. In the fog all men are killers.\n\nShe had never seen a thicker fog than this one. On the larger canals, the watermen would be running their serpent boats into one another, unable to make out any more than dim lights from the buildings to either side of them.\n\nMercy passed an old man with a lantern walking the other way, and envied him his light. The street was so gloomy she could scarcely see where she was stepping. In the humbler parts of the city, the houses, shops, and warehouses crowded together, leaning on each other like drunken lovers, their upper stories so close that you could step from one balcony to the next. The streets below became dark tunnels where every footfall echoed. The small canals were even more hazardous, since many of the houses that lined them had privies jutting out over the water. Izembaro loved to give the Sealord’s speech fromThe Merchant’s Melancholy Daughter, about how “here the last Titan yet stands, astride the stony shoulders of his brothers,” but Mercy preferred the scene where the fat merchant shat on the Sealord’s head as he passed underneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something like that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and sailor alike howl with laughter to see it.\n\nThe Gate stood close by the edge of Drowned Town, between the Outer Harbor and the Purple Harbor. An old warehouse had burnt there and the ground was sinking a little more each year, so the land came cheap. Atop the flooded stone foundation of the warehouse, Izembaro raised his cavernous playhall. The Dome and the Blue Lantern might enjoy more fashionable environs, he told his mummers, but here between the harbors they would never lack for sailors and whores to fill their pit. The Ship was close by, still pulling handsome crowds to the quay where she had been moored for twenty years, he said, and the Gate would flourish too.\n\nTime had proved him right. The Gate’s stage had developed a tilt as the building settled, their costumes were prone to mildew, and water snakes nested in the flooded cellar, but none of that troubled the mummers so long as the house was full.\n\nThe last bridge was made of rope and raw planks, and seemed to dissolve into nothingness, but that was only the fog. Mercy scampered across, her heels ringing on the wood. The fog opened before her like a tattered grey curtain to reveal the playhouse. Buttery yellow light spilled from the doors, and Mercy could hear voices from within. Beside the entrance, Big Brusco had painted over the title of the last show, and writtenThe Bloody Hand in its place in huge red letters. He was painting a bloody hand beneath the words, for those who could not read. Mercy stopped to have a look. “That’s a nice hand,” she told him.\n\n“Thumb’s crooked.” Brusco dabbed at it with his brush. “King o’ the Mummers been asking after you.”\n\n“It was so dark I slept and slept.” When Izembaro had first dubbed himself the King of the Mummers, the company had taken a wicked pleasure in it, savoring the outrage of their rivals from the Dome and the Blue Lantern. Of late, though, Izembaro had begun to take his title too seriously. “He will only play kings now,” Marro said, rolling his eyes, “and if the play has no king in it, he would sooner not stage it at all.”\n\nThe Bloody Hand offered two kings, the fat one and the boy. Izembaro would play the fat one. It was not a large part, but he had a fine speech as he lay dying, and a splendid fight with a demonic boar before that. Phario Forel had written it, and he had the bloodiest quill of all of Braavos.\n\nMercy found the company assembled behind the stage, and slipped in between Daena and the Snapper at the back, hoping her late arrival would go unnoticed. Izembaro was telling everyone that he expected the Gate to be packed to the rafters this evening, despite the fog. “The King of Westeros is sending his envoy to do homage to the King of the Mummers tonight,” he told his troupe. “We will not disappoint our fellow monarch.”\n\n“We?” said the Snapper, who did all the costumes for the mummers. “Is there more than one of him, now?”\n\n“He’s fat enough to count for two,” whispered Bobono. Every mummer’s troupe had to have a dwarf. He was theirs. When he saw Mercy, he gave her a leer. “Oho,” he said, “there she is. Is the little girl all ready for her rape?” He smacked his lips.\n\nThe Snapper smacked him in the head. “Be quiet.”\n\nThe King of the Mummers ignored the brief commotion. He was still talking, telling the mummers how magnificent they must be. Besides the Westerosi envoy, there would be keyholders in the crowd this evening, and famous courtesans as well. He did not intend for them to leave with a poor opinion of the Gate. “It shall go ill for any man who fails me,” he promised, a threat he borrowed from the speech Prince Garin gives on the eve of battle in Wroth of the Dragonlords, Phario Forel’s first play.\n\nBy the time Izembaro finally finished speaking, less than an hour remained before the show, and the mummers were all frantic and fretful by turns. The Gate rang to the sound of Mercy’s name.\n\n“Mercy,” her friend Daena implored, “Lady Stork has stepped on the hem of her gown again. Come help me sew it up.”\n\n“Mercy,” the Stranger called, “bring the bloody paste, my horn is coming loose.”\n\n“Mercy,” boomed Izembaro the Great himself, “what have you done with my crown, girl? I cannot make my entrance without my crown. How shall they know that I’m a king?”\n\n“Mercy,” squeaked the dwarf Bobono, “Mercy, something’s amiss with my laces, my cock keeps flopping out.”\n\nShe fetched the sticky paste and fastened the Stranger’s left horn back onto his forehead. She found Izembaro’s crown in the privy where he always left it and helped him pin it to his wig, and then ran for needle and thread so the Snapper could sew the lace hem back onto the cloth-of-gold gown that the queen would wear in the wedding scene.\n\nAnd Bobono’s cock was indeed flopping out. It was made to flop out, for the rape. What a hideous thing, Mercy thought as she knelt before the dwarf to fix him. The cock was a foot long and as thick as her arm, big enough to be seen from the highest balcony. The dyer had done a poor job with the leather, though; the thing was a mottled pink and white, with a bulbous head the color of a plum. Mercy pushed it back into Bobono’s breeches and laced him back up. “Mercy,” he sang as she tied him tight, “Mercy, Mercy, come to my room tonight and make a man of me.”\n\n“I’ll make a eunuch of you if you keep unlacing yourself just so I’ll fiddle with your crotch.”\n\n“We were meant to be together, Mercy,” Bobono insisted. “Look, we’re just the same height.”\n\n“Only when I’m on my knees. Do you remember your first line?” It had only been a fortnight since the dwarf had lurched onto stage in his cups and opened The Anguish of the Archon with the grumpkin’s speech from The Merchant’s Lusty Lady. Izembaro would skin him alive if he made such a blunder again, and never mind how hard it was to find a good dwarf.\n\n“What are we playing, Mercy?” Bobono asked innocently.\n\nHe is teasing me, Mercy thought. He’s not drunk tonight, he knows the show perfectly well. “We are doing Phario’s new Bloody Hand, in honor of the envoy from the Seven Kingdoms.”\n\n“Now I recall.” Bobono lowered his voice to a sinister croak. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he said. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude shape you see before you.” With that, he grabbed at her chest, fumbling for a nipple. “You have no titties. How can I rape a girl with no titties?”\n\nShe caught his nose between her thumb and forefinger and twisted. “You’ll have no nose until you get your hands off me.”\n\n“Owwwww,” the dwarf squealed, releasing her.\n\n“I’ll grow titties in a year or two.” Mercy rose, to tower over the little man. “But you’ll never grow another nose. You think of that, before you touch me there.”\n\nBobono rubbed his tender nose. “There’s no need to get so shy. I’ll be raping you soon enough.”\n\n“Not until the second act.”\n\n“I always give Wendeyne’s titties a nice squeeze when I rape her in The Anguish of the Archon,” the dwarf complained. “She likes it, and the pit does too. You have to please the pit.”\n\nThat was one of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” as he liked to call them. You have to please the pit. “I bet it would please the pit if I ripped off the dwarf’s cock and beat him about the head with it,” Mercy replied. “That’s something they won’t have seen before.” Always give them something they haven’t seen before was another of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” and one that Bobono had no easy answer for. “There, you’re done,” Mercy announced. “Now see if you can keep in your breeches till it’s needed.”\n\nIzembaro was calling for her again. Now he could not find his boar spear. Mercy found it for him, helped Big Brusco don his boar suit, checked the trick daggers just to make certain no one had replaced one with a real blade (someone had done that at the Dome once, and a mummer had died), and poured Lady Stork the little nip of wine she liked to have before each play. When all the cries of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” finally died away, she stole a moment for a quick peek out into the house.\n\nThe pit was as full as ever she’d seen it, and they were enjoying themselves already, joking and jostling, eating and drinking. She saw a peddler selling chunks of cheese, ripping them off the wheel with his fingers whenever he found a buyer. A woman had a bag of wrinkled apples. Skins of wine were being passed from hand to hand, some girls were selling kisses, and one sailor was playing the sea pipes. The sad-eyed little man called Quill stood in the back, come to see what he could steal for one of his own plays. Cossomo the Conjurer had come as well, and on his arm was Yna, the one-eyed whore from the Happy Port, but Mercy could not know those two, and they would not know Mercy. Daena recognized some Gate regulars in the crowd, and pointed them out for her; the dyer Dellono with his pinched white face and mottled purple hands, Galeo the sausage-maker in his greasy leather apron, tall Tomarro with his pet rat on his shoulder. “Tomarro best not let Galeo see that rat,” Daena warned. “That’s the only meat he puts in them sausages, I hear.” Mercy covered her mouth and laughed.\n\nThe balconies were filling too. The first and third levels were for merchants and captains and other respectable folk. The bravos preferred the fourth and highest, where the seats were cheapest. It was a riot of bright color up there, while down below more somber shades held sway. The second balcony was cut up into private boxes where the mighty could comport themselves in comfort and privacy, safely apart from the vulgarity above and below. They had the best view of the stage, and servants to bring them food, wine, cushions, whatever they might desire. It was rare to find the second balcony more than half full at the Gate; such of the mighty who relished a night of mummery were more inclined to visit the Dome or the Blue Lantern, where the offerings were considered subtler and more poetic.\n\nThis night was different, though, no doubt on account of the Westerosi envoy. In one box sat three scions of Otharys, each accompanied by a famous courtesan; Prestayn sat alone, a man so ancient that you wondered how he ever reached his seat; Torone and Pranelis shared a box, as they shared an uncomfortable alliance; the Third Sword was hosting a half-dozen friends.\n\n“I count five keyholders,” said Daena.\n\n“Bessaro is so fat you ought to count him twice,” Mercy replied, giggling. Izembaro had a belly on him, but compared to Bessaro he was as lithe as a willow. The keyholder was so big he needed a special seat, thrice the size of a common chair.\n\n“They’re all fat, them Reyaans,” Daena said. “Bellies as big as their ships. You should have seen the father. He made this one look small. One time he was summoned to the Hall of Truth to vote, but when he stepped onto his barge it sank.” She clutched Mercy by the elbow. “Look, the Sealord’s box.” The Sealord had never visited the Gate, but Izembaro named a box for him anyway, the largest and most opulent in the house. “That must be the Westerosi envoy. Have you ever seen such clothes on an old man? And look, he’s brought the Black Pearl!”\n\nThe envoy was slight and balding, with a funny grey wisp of a beard growing from his chin. His cloak was yellow velvet, and his breeches. His doublet was a blue so bright it almost made Mercy’s eyes water. Upon his breast a shield had been embroidered in yellow thread, and on the shield was a proud blue rooster picked out in lapis lazuli. One of his guards helped him to his seat, while two others stood behind him in the back of the box.\n\nThe woman with him could not have been more than a third his age. She was so lovely that the lamps seemed to burn brighter when she passed. She had dressed in a low-cut gown of pale yellow silk, startling against the light brown of her skin. Her black hair was bound up in a net of spun gold, and a jet-and-gold necklace brushed against the top of her full breasts. As they watched, she leaned close to the envoy and whispered something in his ear that made him laugh. “They should call her the Brown Pearl,” Mercy said to Daena. “She’s more brown than black.”\n\n“The first Black Pearl was black as a pot of ink,” said Daena. “She was a pirate queen, fathered by a Sealord’s son on a princess from the Summer Isles. A dragon king from Westeros took her for his lover.”\n\n“I would like to see a dragon,” Mercy said wistfully. “Why does the envoy have a chicken on his chest?”\n\nDaena howled. “Mercy, don’t you know anything? It’s his siggle. In the Sunset Kingdoms all the lords have siggles. Some have flowers, some have fish, some have bears and elks and other things. See, the envoy’s guards are wearing lions.”\n\nIt was true. There were four guards; big, hard-looking men in ringmail, with heavy Westerosi longswords sheathed at their hips. Their crimson cloaks were bordered in whorls of gold, and golden lions with red garnet eyes clasped each cloak at the shoulder. When Mercy glanced at the faces beneath the gilded, lion-crested helm, her belly gave a quiver.The gods have given me a gift. Her fingers clutched hard at Daena’s arm. “That guard. The one on the end, behind the Black Pearl.”\n\n“What of him? Do you know him?”\n\n“No.” Mercy had been born and bred in Braavos, how could she know some Westerosi? She had to think a moment. “It’s only… well, he’s fair to look on, don’t you think?” He was, in a rough-hewn way, though his eyes were hard.\n\nDaena shrugged. “He’s very old. Not so old as the other ones, but… he could be thirty. And Westerosi. They’re terrible savages, Mercy. Best stay well away from his sort.”\n\n“Stay away?” Mercy giggled. She was a giggly sort of girl, was Mercy. “No. I’ve got to get closer.” She gave Daena a squeeze and said, “If the Snapper comes looking for me, tell her that I went off to read my lines again.” She only had a few, and most were just, “Oh, no, no, no,” and “Don’t, oh don’t, don’t touch me,” and “Please, m’lord, I am still a maiden,” but this was the first time Izembaro had given her any lines at all, so it was only to be expected that poor Mercy would want to get them right.\n\nThe envoy from the Seven Kingdoms had taken two of his guards into his box to stand behind him and the Black Pearl, but the other two had been posted just outside the door to make certain he was not disturbed. They were talking quietly in the Common Tongue of Westeros as she slipped up silently behind them in the darkened passage. That was not a language Mercy knew.\n\n“Seven hells, this place is damp,” she heard her guard complain. “I’m chilled to the bones. Where are the bloody orange trees? I always heard there were orange trees in the Free Cities. Lemons and limes. Pomegranates. Hot peppers, warm nights, girls with bare bellies. Where are the bare-bellied girls, I ask you?”\n\n“Down in Lys, and Myr, and Old Volantis,” the other guard replied. He was an older man, big-bellied and grizzled. “I went to Lys with Lord Tywin once, when he was Hand to Aerys. Braavos is north of King’s Landing, fool. Can’t you read a bloody map?”\n\n“How long do you think we’ll be here?”\n\n“Longer than you’d like,” the old man replied. “If he goes back without the gold the queen will have his head. Besides, I seen that wife of his. There’s steps in Casterly Rock she can’t go down for fear she’d get stuck, that’s how fat she is. Who’d go back to that, when he has his sooty queen?”\n\nThe handsome guardsman grinned. “Don’t suppose he’ll share her with us, afterward?”\n\n“What, are you mad? You think he notices the likes of us? Bloody bugger don’t even get our names right half the time. Maybe it was different with Clegane.”\n\n“Ser wasn’t one for mummer shows and fancy whores. When Ser wanted a woman he took one, but sometimes he’d let us have her, after. I wouldn’t mind having a taste of that Black Pearl. You think she’s pink between her legs?”\n\nMercy wanted to hear more, but there was no time. The Bloody Hand was about to start, and the Snapper would be looking for her to help with costumes. Izembaro might be the King of the Mummers, but the Snapper was the one that they all feared. Time enough for her pretty guardsman later.\n\nThe Bloody Hand opened in a lichyard.\n\nWhen the dwarf appeared suddenly from behind a wooden tombstone, the crowd began to hiss and curse. Bobono waddled to the front of the stage and leered at them. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he began, snarling the words. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay… “\n\nBy then Marro had appeared behind him, gaunt and terrible in the Stranger’s long black robes. His face was black as well, his teeth red and shiny with blood, while ivory horns jutted upwards from his brow. Bobono could not see him, but the balconies could, and now the pit as well. The Gate grew deathly quiet. Marro moved forward silently.\n\nSo did Mercy. The costumes were all hung, and the Snapper was busy sewing Daena into her gown for the court scene, so Mercy’s absence should not be noted. Quiet as a shadow, she slipped around the back again, up to where the guardsmen stood outside the envoy’s box. Standing in a darkened alcove, still as stone, she had a good look at his face. She studied it carefully, to be sure. Am I too young for him? she wondered. Too plain? Too skinny? She hoped he wasn’t the sort of man who liked big breasts on a girl. Bobono had been right about her chest. It would be best if I could take him back to my place, have him all to myself. But will he come with me?\n\n“You think it might be him?” the pretty one was saying.\n\n“What, did the Others take your wits?”\n\n“Why not? He’s a dwarf, ain’t he?”\n\n“The Imp weren’t the only dwarf in the world.”\n\n“Maybe not, but look here, everyone says how clever he was, true? So maybe he figures the last place his sister would ever look for him would be in some mummer show, making fun of himself. So he does just that, to tweak her nose.”\n\n“Ah, you’re mad.”\n\n“Well, maybe I’ll follow him after the mummery. Find out for myself.” The guardsman put a hand on the hilt of his sword. “If I’m right, I’ll be a ma lord, and if I’m wrong, well, bleed it, it’s just some dwarf.” He gave a bark of laughter.\n\nOn stage, Bobono was bargaining with Marro’s sinister Stranger. He had a big voice for such a little man, and he made it ring off the highest rafters now. “Give me the cup,” he told the Stranger, “for I shall drink deep. And if it tastes of gold and lion’s blood, so much the better. As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them in fear in place of love.”\n\nMercy mouthed the last lines along with him. They were better lines than hers, and apt besides. He’ll want me or he won’t, she thought, so let the play begin. She said a silent prayer to the god of many faces, slipped out of her alcove, and flounced up to the guardsmen. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy. “My lords,” she said, “do you speak Braavosi? Oh, please, tell me you do.”\n\nThe two guardsmen exchanged a look. “What’s this thing going on about?” the older one asked. “Who is she?”\n\n“One of the mummers,” said the pretty one. He pushed his fair hair back off his brow and smiled at her. “Sorry, sweetling, we don’t speak your gibble-gabble.”\n\nFuss and feathers, Mercy thought, they only know the Common Tongue. That was no good. Give it up or go ahead. She could not give it up. She wanted him so bad. “I know your tongue, a little,” she lied, with Mercy’s sweetest smile. “You are lords of Westeros, my friend said.”\n\nThe old one laughed. “Lords? Aye, that’s us.”\n\nMercy looked down at her feet, so shy. “Izembaro said to please the lords,” she whispered. “If there is anything you want, anything at all… “\n\nThe two guardsmen exchanged a look. Then the handsome one reached out and touched her breast. “Anything?“\n\n“You’re disgusting,” said the older man.\n\n“Why? If this Izembaro wants to be hospitable, it would be rude to refuse.” He gave her nipple a tweak through the fabric of her dress, just the way the dwarf had done when she was fixing his cock for him. “Mummers are the next best thing to whores.”\n\n“Might be, but this one is a child.”\n\n“I am not,” lied Mercy. “I’m a maiden now.”\n\n“Not for long,” said the comely one. “I’m Lord Rafford, sweetling, and I know just what I want. Hike up those skirts now, and lean back against that wall.”\n\n“Not here,” Mercy said, brushing his hands away. “Not where the play is on. I might cry out, and Izembaro would be mad.”\n\n“Where, then?”\n\n“I know a place.”\n\nThe older guard was scowling. “What, you think can just scamper off? What if his knightliness comes looking for you?”\n\n“Why would he? He’s got a show to watch. And he’s got his own whore, why shouldn’t I have mine? This won’t take long.”\n\nNo, she thought, it won’t. Mercy took him by the hand, led him through the back and down the steps and out into the foggy night. “You could be a mummer, if you wanted,” she told him, as he pressed her up against the wall of the playhouse.\n\n“Me?” The guardsman snorted. “Not me, girl. All that bloody talking, I wouldn’t remember half of it.”\n\n“It’s hard at first,” she admitted. “But after a time it comes easier. I could teach you to say a line. I could.”\n\nHe grabbed her wrist. “I’ll do the teaching. Time for your first lesson.” He pulled her hard against him and kissed her on the lips, forcing his tongue into her mouth. It was all wet and slimy, like an eel. Mercy licked it with her own tongue, then broke away from him, breathless. “Not here. Someone might see. My room’s not far, but hurry. I have to be back before the second act, or I’ll miss my rape.”\n\nHe grinned. “No fear o’ that, girl.” But he let her pull him after her. Hand in hand, they went racing through the fog, over bridges and through alleys and up five flights of splintery wooden stairs. The guardsman was panting by the time they burst through the door of her little room. Mercy lit a tallow candle, then danced around at him, giggling. “Oh, now you’re all tired out. I forgot how old you were, m’lord. Do you want to take a little nap? Just lie down and close your eyes, and I’ll come back after the Imp’s done raping me.”\n\n“You’re not going anywhere.” He pulled her roughly to him. “Get those rags off, and I’ll show you how old I am, girl.”\n\n“Mercy,” she said. “My name is Mercy. Can you say it?”\n\n“Mercy,” he said. “My name is Raff.”\n\n“I know.” She slipped her hand between his legs, and felt how hard he was through the wool of his breeches.\n\n“The laces,” he urged her. “Be a sweet girl and undo them.” Instead she slid her finger down along the inside of his thigh. He gave a grunt. “Damn, be careful there, you — “\n\nMercy gave a gasp and stepped away, her face confused and frightened. “You’rebleeding.”\n\n“Wha — ” He looked down at himself. “Gods be good. What did you do to me, you little cunt?” The red stain spread across his thigh, soaking the heavy fabric.\n\n“Nothing,” Mercy squeaked. “I never… oh, oh, there’s so much blood. Stop it, stop it, you’re scaring me.”\n\nHe shook his head, a dazed look on his face. When he pressed his hand to his thigh, blood squirted through his fingers. It was running down his leg, into his boot. He doesn’t look so comely now, she thought. He just looks white and frightened.\n\n“A towel,” the guardsman gasped. “Bring me a towel, a rag, press down on it. Gods. I feel dizzy.” His leg was drenched with blood from the thigh down. When he tried to put his weight on it, his knee buckled and he fell. “Help me,” he pleaded, as the crotch of his breeches reddened. “Mother have mercy, girl. A healer… run and find a healer, quick now.”\n\n“There’s one on the next canal, but he won’t come. You have to go to him. Can’t you walk?”\n\n“Walk?” His fingers were slick with blood. “Are you blind, girl? I’m bleeding like a stuck pig. I can’t walk on this.”\n\n“Well,” she said, “I don’t know how you’ll get there, then.”\n\n“You’ll need to carry me.”\n\nSee? thought Mercy. You know your line, and so do I.\n\n“Think so?” asked Arya, sweetly.\n\nRaff the Sweetling looked up sharply as the long thin blade came sliding from her sleeve. She slipped it through his throat beneath the chin, twisted, and ripped it back out sideways with a single smooth slash. A fine red rain followed, and in his eyes the light went out.\n\n“Valar morghulis,” Arya whispered, but Raff was dead and did not hear. She sniffed. I should have helped him down the steps before I killed him. Now I’ll need to drag him all the way to the canal and roll him in. The eels would do the rest.\n\n“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang sadly. A foolish, giddy girl she’d been, but good hearted. She would miss her, and she would miss Daena and the Snapper and the rest, even Izembaro and Bobono. This would make trouble for the Sealord and the envoy with the chicken on his chest, she did not doubt.\n\nShe would think about that later, though. Just now, there was no time. I had best run. Mercy still had some lines to say, her first lines and her last, and Izembaro would have her pretty little empty head if she were late for her own rape.\n","source":"_posts/MERCY.md","raw":"---\ntitle: MERCY\ndate: 2016-04-06 20:51:57\ntags: 冰与火之歌\ncomments: false\n---\n\n## MERCYE\\--EXCERPT FROM THE WINDS OF WINTER\n\nShe woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.\n\nThe smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her nightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running through some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on the scent of prey.\n\nHalf-light filled the room, grey and gloomy. Shivering, she sat up in bed and ran a hand across her scalp. Stubble bristled against her palm. I need to shave before Izembaro sees. Mercy, I’m Mercy, and tonight I’ll be raped and murdered. Her true name was Mercedene, but Mercy was all anyone ever called her…\n<!--more-->\nExcept in dreams. She took a breath to quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of what she’d dreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it, though, and a full moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she ran.\n\nShe had fastened the shutters back so the morning sun might wake her. But there was no sun outside the window of Mercy’s little room, only a wall of shifting grey fog. The air had grown chilly… and a good thing, else she might have slept all day. It would be just like Mercy to sleep through her own rape.\n\nGooseprickles covered her legs. Her coverlet had twisted around her like a snake. She unwound it, threw the blanket to the bare plank floor and padded naked to the window. Braavos was lost in fog. She could see the green water of the little canal below, the cobbled stone street that ran beneath her building, two arches of the mossy bridge… but the far end of the bridge vanished in greyness, and of the buildings across the canal only a few vague lights remained. She heard a soft splash as a serpent boat emerged beneath the bridge’s central arch. “What hour?” Mercy called down to the man who stood by the snake’s uplifted tail, pushing her onward with his pole.\n\nThe waterman gazed up, searching for the voice. “Four, by the Titan’s roar.” His words echoed hollowly off the swirling green waters and the walls of unseen buildings.\n\nShe was not late, not yet, but she should not dawdle. Mercy was a happy soul and a hard worker, but seldom timely. That would not serve tonight. The envoy from Westeros was expected at the Gate this evening, and Izembaro would be in no mood to hear excuses, even if she served them up with a sweet smile.\n\nShe had filled her basin from the canal last night before she went to sleep, preferring the brackish water to the slimy green rainwater stewing in the cistern out back. Dipping a rough cloth, she washed herself head to heel, standing on one leg at a time to scrub her calloused feet. After that she found her razor. A bare scalp helped the wigs fit better, Izembaro claimed.\n\nShe shaved, donned her smallclothes, and slipped a shapeless brown wool dress down over her head. One of her stockings needed mending, she saw as she pulled it up. She would ask the Snapper for help; her own sewing was so wretched that the wardrobe mistress usually took pity on her. Else I could filtch a nicer pair from wardrobe. That was risky, though. Izembaro hated it when the mummers wore his costumes in the streets.Except for Wendeyne. Give Izembaro’s cock a little suck and a girl can wear any costume that she wants. Mercy was not so foolish as all that. Daena had warned her. “Girls who start down that road wind up on the Ship, where every man in the pit knows he can have any pretty thing he might see up on the stage, if his purse is plump enough.”\n\nHer boots were lumps of old brown leather mottled with saltstains and cracked from long wear, her belt a length of hempen rope dyed blue. She knotted it about her waist, and hung a knife on her right hip and a coin pouch on her left. Last of all she threw her cloak across her shoulders. It was a real mummer’s cloak, purple wool lined in red silk, with a hood to keep the rain off, and three secret pockets too. She’d hid some coins in one of those, an iron key in another, a blade in the last. A real blade, not a fruit knife like the one on her hip, but it did not belong to Mercy, no more than her other treasures did. The fruit knife belonged to Mercy. She was made for eating fruit, for smiling and joking, for working hard and doing as she was told.\n\n“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang as she descended the wooden stair to the street. The handrail was splintery, the steps steep, and there were five flights, but that was why she’d gotten the room so cheap. That, and Mercy’s smile. She might be bald and skinny, but Mercy had a pretty smile, and a certain grace. Even Izembaro agreed that she was graceful. She was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with feet instead of wings the way was longer. Braavos was a crooked city. The streets were crooked, the alleys were crookeder, and the canals were crookedest of all. Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the Ragman’s Road along the Outer Harbor, where she had the sea before her and the sky above, and a clear view across the Great Lagoon to the Arsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail her as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of tarry Ibbenese whalers and big-bellied Westerosi cogs. Mercy could not always understand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes she would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if they had the coin.\n\nThe long way also took her across the Bridge of Eyes with its carved stone faces. From the top of its span, she could look through the arches and see all the city: the green copper domes of the Hall of Truth, the masts rising like a forest from the Purple Harbor, the tall towers of the mighty, the golden thunderbolt turning on its spire atop the Sealord’s Palace… even the Titan’s bronze shoulders, off across the dark green waters. But that was only when the sun was shining down on Braavos. If the fog was thick there was nothing to see but grey, so today Mercy chose the shorter route to save some wear on her poor cracked boots.\n\nThe mists seemed to part before her and close up again as she passed. The cobblestones were wet and slick under her feet. She heard a cat yowl plaintively. Braavos was a good city for cats, and they roamed everywhere, especially at night. In the fog all cats are grey, Mercy thought. In the fog all men are killers.\n\nShe had never seen a thicker fog than this one. On the larger canals, the watermen would be running their serpent boats into one another, unable to make out any more than dim lights from the buildings to either side of them.\n\nMercy passed an old man with a lantern walking the other way, and envied him his light. The street was so gloomy she could scarcely see where she was stepping. In the humbler parts of the city, the houses, shops, and warehouses crowded together, leaning on each other like drunken lovers, their upper stories so close that you could step from one balcony to the next. The streets below became dark tunnels where every footfall echoed. The small canals were even more hazardous, since many of the houses that lined them had privies jutting out over the water. Izembaro loved to give the Sealord’s speech fromThe Merchant’s Melancholy Daughter, about how “here the last Titan yet stands, astride the stony shoulders of his brothers,” but Mercy preferred the scene where the fat merchant shat on the Sealord’s head as he passed underneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something like that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and sailor alike howl with laughter to see it.\n\nThe Gate stood close by the edge of Drowned Town, between the Outer Harbor and the Purple Harbor. An old warehouse had burnt there and the ground was sinking a little more each year, so the land came cheap. Atop the flooded stone foundation of the warehouse, Izembaro raised his cavernous playhall. The Dome and the Blue Lantern might enjoy more fashionable environs, he told his mummers, but here between the harbors they would never lack for sailors and whores to fill their pit. The Ship was close by, still pulling handsome crowds to the quay where she had been moored for twenty years, he said, and the Gate would flourish too.\n\nTime had proved him right. The Gate’s stage had developed a tilt as the building settled, their costumes were prone to mildew, and water snakes nested in the flooded cellar, but none of that troubled the mummers so long as the house was full.\n\nThe last bridge was made of rope and raw planks, and seemed to dissolve into nothingness, but that was only the fog. Mercy scampered across, her heels ringing on the wood. The fog opened before her like a tattered grey curtain to reveal the playhouse. Buttery yellow light spilled from the doors, and Mercy could hear voices from within. Beside the entrance, Big Brusco had painted over the title of the last show, and writtenThe Bloody Hand in its place in huge red letters. He was painting a bloody hand beneath the words, for those who could not read. Mercy stopped to have a look. “That’s a nice hand,” she told him.\n\n“Thumb’s crooked.” Brusco dabbed at it with his brush. “King o’ the Mummers been asking after you.”\n\n“It was so dark I slept and slept.” When Izembaro had first dubbed himself the King of the Mummers, the company had taken a wicked pleasure in it, savoring the outrage of their rivals from the Dome and the Blue Lantern. Of late, though, Izembaro had begun to take his title too seriously. “He will only play kings now,” Marro said, rolling his eyes, “and if the play has no king in it, he would sooner not stage it at all.”\n\nThe Bloody Hand offered two kings, the fat one and the boy. Izembaro would play the fat one. It was not a large part, but he had a fine speech as he lay dying, and a splendid fight with a demonic boar before that. Phario Forel had written it, and he had the bloodiest quill of all of Braavos.\n\nMercy found the company assembled behind the stage, and slipped in between Daena and the Snapper at the back, hoping her late arrival would go unnoticed. Izembaro was telling everyone that he expected the Gate to be packed to the rafters this evening, despite the fog. “The King of Westeros is sending his envoy to do homage to the King of the Mummers tonight,” he told his troupe. “We will not disappoint our fellow monarch.”\n\n“We?” said the Snapper, who did all the costumes for the mummers. “Is there more than one of him, now?”\n\n“He’s fat enough to count for two,” whispered Bobono. Every mummer’s troupe had to have a dwarf. He was theirs. When he saw Mercy, he gave her a leer. “Oho,” he said, “there she is. Is the little girl all ready for her rape?” He smacked his lips.\n\nThe Snapper smacked him in the head. “Be quiet.”\n\nThe King of the Mummers ignored the brief commotion. He was still talking, telling the mummers how magnificent they must be. Besides the Westerosi envoy, there would be keyholders in the crowd this evening, and famous courtesans as well. He did not intend for them to leave with a poor opinion of the Gate. “It shall go ill for any man who fails me,” he promised, a threat he borrowed from the speech Prince Garin gives on the eve of battle in Wroth of the Dragonlords, Phario Forel’s first play.\n\nBy the time Izembaro finally finished speaking, less than an hour remained before the show, and the mummers were all frantic and fretful by turns. The Gate rang to the sound of Mercy’s name.\n\n“Mercy,” her friend Daena implored, “Lady Stork has stepped on the hem of her gown again. Come help me sew it up.”\n\n“Mercy,” the Stranger called, “bring the bloody paste, my horn is coming loose.”\n\n“Mercy,” boomed Izembaro the Great himself, “what have you done with my crown, girl? I cannot make my entrance without my crown. How shall they know that I’m a king?”\n\n“Mercy,” squeaked the dwarf Bobono, “Mercy, something’s amiss with my laces, my cock keeps flopping out.”\n\nShe fetched the sticky paste and fastened the Stranger’s left horn back onto his forehead. She found Izembaro’s crown in the privy where he always left it and helped him pin it to his wig, and then ran for needle and thread so the Snapper could sew the lace hem back onto the cloth-of-gold gown that the queen would wear in the wedding scene.\n\nAnd Bobono’s cock was indeed flopping out. It was made to flop out, for the rape. What a hideous thing, Mercy thought as she knelt before the dwarf to fix him. The cock was a foot long and as thick as her arm, big enough to be seen from the highest balcony. The dyer had done a poor job with the leather, though; the thing was a mottled pink and white, with a bulbous head the color of a plum. Mercy pushed it back into Bobono’s breeches and laced him back up. “Mercy,” he sang as she tied him tight, “Mercy, Mercy, come to my room tonight and make a man of me.”\n\n“I’ll make a eunuch of you if you keep unlacing yourself just so I’ll fiddle with your crotch.”\n\n“We were meant to be together, Mercy,” Bobono insisted. “Look, we’re just the same height.”\n\n“Only when I’m on my knees. Do you remember your first line?” It had only been a fortnight since the dwarf had lurched onto stage in his cups and opened The Anguish of the Archon with the grumpkin’s speech from The Merchant’s Lusty Lady. Izembaro would skin him alive if he made such a blunder again, and never mind how hard it was to find a good dwarf.\n\n“What are we playing, Mercy?” Bobono asked innocently.\n\nHe is teasing me, Mercy thought. He’s not drunk tonight, he knows the show perfectly well. “We are doing Phario’s new Bloody Hand, in honor of the envoy from the Seven Kingdoms.”\n\n“Now I recall.” Bobono lowered his voice to a sinister croak. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he said. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude shape you see before you.” With that, he grabbed at her chest, fumbling for a nipple. “You have no titties. How can I rape a girl with no titties?”\n\nShe caught his nose between her thumb and forefinger and twisted. “You’ll have no nose until you get your hands off me.”\n\n“Owwwww,” the dwarf squealed, releasing her.\n\n“I’ll grow titties in a year or two.” Mercy rose, to tower over the little man. “But you’ll never grow another nose. You think of that, before you touch me there.”\n\nBobono rubbed his tender nose. “There’s no need to get so shy. I’ll be raping you soon enough.”\n\n“Not until the second act.”\n\n“I always give Wendeyne’s titties a nice squeeze when I rape her in The Anguish of the Archon,” the dwarf complained. “She likes it, and the pit does too. You have to please the pit.”\n\nThat was one of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” as he liked to call them. You have to please the pit. “I bet it would please the pit if I ripped off the dwarf’s cock and beat him about the head with it,” Mercy replied. “That’s something they won’t have seen before.” Always give them something they haven’t seen before was another of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” and one that Bobono had no easy answer for. “There, you’re done,” Mercy announced. “Now see if you can keep in your breeches till it’s needed.”\n\nIzembaro was calling for her again. Now he could not find his boar spear. Mercy found it for him, helped Big Brusco don his boar suit, checked the trick daggers just to make certain no one had replaced one with a real blade (someone had done that at the Dome once, and a mummer had died), and poured Lady Stork the little nip of wine she liked to have before each play. When all the cries of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy” finally died away, she stole a moment for a quick peek out into the house.\n\nThe pit was as full as ever she’d seen it, and they were enjoying themselves already, joking and jostling, eating and drinking. She saw a peddler selling chunks of cheese, ripping them off the wheel with his fingers whenever he found a buyer. A woman had a bag of wrinkled apples. Skins of wine were being passed from hand to hand, some girls were selling kisses, and one sailor was playing the sea pipes. The sad-eyed little man called Quill stood in the back, come to see what he could steal for one of his own plays. Cossomo the Conjurer had come as well, and on his arm was Yna, the one-eyed whore from the Happy Port, but Mercy could not know those two, and they would not know Mercy. Daena recognized some Gate regulars in the crowd, and pointed them out for her; the dyer Dellono with his pinched white face and mottled purple hands, Galeo the sausage-maker in his greasy leather apron, tall Tomarro with his pet rat on his shoulder. “Tomarro best not let Galeo see that rat,” Daena warned. “That’s the only meat he puts in them sausages, I hear.” Mercy covered her mouth and laughed.\n\nThe balconies were filling too. The first and third levels were for merchants and captains and other respectable folk. The bravos preferred the fourth and highest, where the seats were cheapest. It was a riot of bright color up there, while down below more somber shades held sway. The second balcony was cut up into private boxes where the mighty could comport themselves in comfort and privacy, safely apart from the vulgarity above and below. They had the best view of the stage, and servants to bring them food, wine, cushions, whatever they might desire. It was rare to find the second balcony more than half full at the Gate; such of the mighty who relished a night of mummery were more inclined to visit the Dome or the Blue Lantern, where the offerings were considered subtler and more poetic.\n\nThis night was different, though, no doubt on account of the Westerosi envoy. In one box sat three scions of Otharys, each accompanied by a famous courtesan; Prestayn sat alone, a man so ancient that you wondered how he ever reached his seat; Torone and Pranelis shared a box, as they shared an uncomfortable alliance; the Third Sword was hosting a half-dozen friends.\n\n“I count five keyholders,” said Daena.\n\n“Bessaro is so fat you ought to count him twice,” Mercy replied, giggling. Izembaro had a belly on him, but compared to Bessaro he was as lithe as a willow. The keyholder was so big he needed a special seat, thrice the size of a common chair.\n\n“They’re all fat, them Reyaans,” Daena said. “Bellies as big as their ships. You should have seen the father. He made this one look small. One time he was summoned to the Hall of Truth to vote, but when he stepped onto his barge it sank.” She clutched Mercy by the elbow. “Look, the Sealord’s box.” The Sealord had never visited the Gate, but Izembaro named a box for him anyway, the largest and most opulent in the house. “That must be the Westerosi envoy. Have you ever seen such clothes on an old man? And look, he’s brought the Black Pearl!”\n\nThe envoy was slight and balding, with a funny grey wisp of a beard growing from his chin. His cloak was yellow velvet, and his breeches. His doublet was a blue so bright it almost made Mercy’s eyes water. Upon his breast a shield had been embroidered in yellow thread, and on the shield was a proud blue rooster picked out in lapis lazuli. One of his guards helped him to his seat, while two others stood behind him in the back of the box.\n\nThe woman with him could not have been more than a third his age. She was so lovely that the lamps seemed to burn brighter when she passed. She had dressed in a low-cut gown of pale yellow silk, startling against the light brown of her skin. Her black hair was bound up in a net of spun gold, and a jet-and-gold necklace brushed against the top of her full breasts. As they watched, she leaned close to the envoy and whispered something in his ear that made him laugh. “They should call her the Brown Pearl,” Mercy said to Daena. “She’s more brown than black.”\n\n“The first Black Pearl was black as a pot of ink,” said Daena. “She was a pirate queen, fathered by a Sealord’s son on a princess from the Summer Isles. A dragon king from Westeros took her for his lover.”\n\n“I would like to see a dragon,” Mercy said wistfully. “Why does the envoy have a chicken on his chest?”\n\nDaena howled. “Mercy, don’t you know anything? It’s his siggle. In the Sunset Kingdoms all the lords have siggles. Some have flowers, some have fish, some have bears and elks and other things. See, the envoy’s guards are wearing lions.”\n\nIt was true. There were four guards; big, hard-looking men in ringmail, with heavy Westerosi longswords sheathed at their hips. Their crimson cloaks were bordered in whorls of gold, and golden lions with red garnet eyes clasped each cloak at the shoulder. When Mercy glanced at the faces beneath the gilded, lion-crested helm, her belly gave a quiver.The gods have given me a gift. Her fingers clutched hard at Daena’s arm. “That guard. The one on the end, behind the Black Pearl.”\n\n“What of him? Do you know him?”\n\n“No.” Mercy had been born and bred in Braavos, how could she know some Westerosi? She had to think a moment. “It’s only… well, he’s fair to look on, don’t you think?” He was, in a rough-hewn way, though his eyes were hard.\n\nDaena shrugged. “He’s very old. Not so old as the other ones, but… he could be thirty. And Westerosi. They’re terrible savages, Mercy. Best stay well away from his sort.”\n\n“Stay away?” Mercy giggled. She was a giggly sort of girl, was Mercy. “No. I’ve got to get closer.” She gave Daena a squeeze and said, “If the Snapper comes looking for me, tell her that I went off to read my lines again.” She only had a few, and most were just, “Oh, no, no, no,” and “Don’t, oh don’t, don’t touch me,” and “Please, m’lord, I am still a maiden,” but this was the first time Izembaro had given her any lines at all, so it was only to be expected that poor Mercy would want to get them right.\n\nThe envoy from the Seven Kingdoms had taken two of his guards into his box to stand behind him and the Black Pearl, but the other two had been posted just outside the door to make certain he was not disturbed. They were talking quietly in the Common Tongue of Westeros as she slipped up silently behind them in the darkened passage. That was not a language Mercy knew.\n\n“Seven hells, this place is damp,” she heard her guard complain. “I’m chilled to the bones. Where are the bloody orange trees? I always heard there were orange trees in the Free Cities. Lemons and limes. Pomegranates. Hot peppers, warm nights, girls with bare bellies. Where are the bare-bellied girls, I ask you?”\n\n“Down in Lys, and Myr, and Old Volantis,” the other guard replied. He was an older man, big-bellied and grizzled. “I went to Lys with Lord Tywin once, when he was Hand to Aerys. Braavos is north of King’s Landing, fool. Can’t you read a bloody map?”\n\n“How long do you think we’ll be here?”\n\n“Longer than you’d like,” the old man replied. “If he goes back without the gold the queen will have his head. Besides, I seen that wife of his. There’s steps in Casterly Rock she can’t go down for fear she’d get stuck, that’s how fat she is. Who’d go back to that, when he has his sooty queen?”\n\nThe handsome guardsman grinned. “Don’t suppose he’ll share her with us, afterward?”\n\n“What, are you mad? You think he notices the likes of us? Bloody bugger don’t even get our names right half the time. Maybe it was different with Clegane.”\n\n“Ser wasn’t one for mummer shows and fancy whores. When Ser wanted a woman he took one, but sometimes he’d let us have her, after. I wouldn’t mind having a taste of that Black Pearl. You think she’s pink between her legs?”\n\nMercy wanted to hear more, but there was no time. The Bloody Hand was about to start, and the Snapper would be looking for her to help with costumes. Izembaro might be the King of the Mummers, but the Snapper was the one that they all feared. Time enough for her pretty guardsman later.\n\nThe Bloody Hand opened in a lichyard.\n\nWhen the dwarf appeared suddenly from behind a wooden tombstone, the crowd began to hiss and curse. Bobono waddled to the front of the stage and leered at them. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he began, snarling the words. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay… “\n\nBy then Marro had appeared behind him, gaunt and terrible in the Stranger’s long black robes. His face was black as well, his teeth red and shiny with blood, while ivory horns jutted upwards from his brow. Bobono could not see him, but the balconies could, and now the pit as well. The Gate grew deathly quiet. Marro moved forward silently.\n\nSo did Mercy. The costumes were all hung, and the Snapper was busy sewing Daena into her gown for the court scene, so Mercy’s absence should not be noted. Quiet as a shadow, she slipped around the back again, up to where the guardsmen stood outside the envoy’s box. Standing in a darkened alcove, still as stone, she had a good look at his face. She studied it carefully, to be sure. Am I too young for him? she wondered. Too plain? Too skinny? She hoped he wasn’t the sort of man who liked big breasts on a girl. Bobono had been right about her chest. It would be best if I could take him back to my place, have him all to myself. But will he come with me?\n\n“You think it might be him?” the pretty one was saying.\n\n“What, did the Others take your wits?”\n\n“Why not? He’s a dwarf, ain’t he?”\n\n“The Imp weren’t the only dwarf in the world.”\n\n“Maybe not, but look here, everyone says how clever he was, true? So maybe he figures the last place his sister would ever look for him would be in some mummer show, making fun of himself. So he does just that, to tweak her nose.”\n\n“Ah, you’re mad.”\n\n“Well, maybe I’ll follow him after the mummery. Find out for myself.” The guardsman put a hand on the hilt of his sword. “If I’m right, I’ll be a ma lord, and if I’m wrong, well, bleed it, it’s just some dwarf.” He gave a bark of laughter.\n\nOn stage, Bobono was bargaining with Marro’s sinister Stranger. He had a big voice for such a little man, and he made it ring off the highest rafters now. “Give me the cup,” he told the Stranger, “for I shall drink deep. And if it tastes of gold and lion’s blood, so much the better. As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them in fear in place of love.”\n\nMercy mouthed the last lines along with him. They were better lines than hers, and apt besides. He’ll want me or he won’t, she thought, so let the play begin. She said a silent prayer to the god of many faces, slipped out of her alcove, and flounced up to the guardsmen. Mercy, Mercy, Mercy. “My lords,” she said, “do you speak Braavosi? Oh, please, tell me you do.”\n\nThe two guardsmen exchanged a look. “What’s this thing going on about?” the older one asked. “Who is she?”\n\n“One of the mummers,” said the pretty one. He pushed his fair hair back off his brow and smiled at her. “Sorry, sweetling, we don’t speak your gibble-gabble.”\n\nFuss and feathers, Mercy thought, they only know the Common Tongue. That was no good. Give it up or go ahead. She could not give it up. She wanted him so bad. “I know your tongue, a little,” she lied, with Mercy’s sweetest smile. “You are lords of Westeros, my friend said.”\n\nThe old one laughed. “Lords? Aye, that’s us.”\n\nMercy looked down at her feet, so shy. “Izembaro said to please the lords,” she whispered. “If there is anything you want, anything at all… “\n\nThe two guardsmen exchanged a look. Then the handsome one reached out and touched her breast. “Anything?“\n\n“You’re disgusting,” said the older man.\n\n“Why? If this Izembaro wants to be hospitable, it would be rude to refuse.” He gave her nipple a tweak through the fabric of her dress, just the way the dwarf had done when she was fixing his cock for him. “Mummers are the next best thing to whores.”\n\n“Might be, but this one is a child.”\n\n“I am not,” lied Mercy. “I’m a maiden now.”\n\n“Not for long,” said the comely one. “I’m Lord Rafford, sweetling, and I know just what I want. Hike up those skirts now, and lean back against that wall.”\n\n“Not here,” Mercy said, brushing his hands away. “Not where the play is on. I might cry out, and Izembaro would be mad.”\n\n“Where, then?”\n\n“I know a place.”\n\nThe older guard was scowling. “What, you think can just scamper off? What if his knightliness comes looking for you?”\n\n“Why would he? He’s got a show to watch. And he’s got his own whore, why shouldn’t I have mine? This won’t take long.”\n\nNo, she thought, it won’t. Mercy took him by the hand, led him through the back and down the steps and out into the foggy night. “You could be a mummer, if you wanted,” she told him, as he pressed her up against the wall of the playhouse.\n\n“Me?” The guardsman snorted. “Not me, girl. All that bloody talking, I wouldn’t remember half of it.”\n\n“It’s hard at first,” she admitted. “But after a time it comes easier. I could teach you to say a line. I could.”\n\nHe grabbed her wrist. “I’ll do the teaching. Time for your first lesson.” He pulled her hard against him and kissed her on the lips, forcing his tongue into her mouth. It was all wet and slimy, like an eel. Mercy licked it with her own tongue, then broke away from him, breathless. “Not here. Someone might see. My room’s not far, but hurry. I have to be back before the second act, or I’ll miss my rape.”\n\nHe grinned. “No fear o’ that, girl.” But he let her pull him after her. Hand in hand, they went racing through the fog, over bridges and through alleys and up five flights of splintery wooden stairs. The guardsman was panting by the time they burst through the door of her little room. Mercy lit a tallow candle, then danced around at him, giggling. “Oh, now you’re all tired out. I forgot how old you were, m’lord. Do you want to take a little nap? Just lie down and close your eyes, and I’ll come back after the Imp’s done raping me.”\n\n“You’re not going anywhere.” He pulled her roughly to him. “Get those rags off, and I’ll show you how old I am, girl.”\n\n“Mercy,” she said. “My name is Mercy. Can you say it?”\n\n“Mercy,” he said. “My name is Raff.”\n\n“I know.” She slipped her hand between his legs, and felt how hard he was through the wool of his breeches.\n\n“The laces,” he urged her. “Be a sweet girl and undo them.” Instead she slid her finger down along the inside of his thigh. He gave a grunt. “Damn, be careful there, you — “\n\nMercy gave a gasp and stepped away, her face confused and frightened. “You’rebleeding.”\n\n“Wha — ” He looked down at himself. “Gods be good. What did you do to me, you little cunt?” The red stain spread across his thigh, soaking the heavy fabric.\n\n“Nothing,” Mercy squeaked. “I never… oh, oh, there’s so much blood. Stop it, stop it, you’re scaring me.”\n\nHe shook his head, a dazed look on his face. When he pressed his hand to his thigh, blood squirted through his fingers. It was running down his leg, into his boot. He doesn’t look so comely now, she thought. He just looks white and frightened.\n\n“A towel,” the guardsman gasped. “Bring me a towel, a rag, press down on it. Gods. I feel dizzy.” His leg was drenched with blood from the thigh down. When he tried to put his weight on it, his knee buckled and he fell. “Help me,” he pleaded, as the crotch of his breeches reddened. “Mother have mercy, girl. A healer… run and find a healer, quick now.”\n\n“There’s one on the next canal, but he won’t come. You have to go to him. Can’t you walk?”\n\n“Walk?” His fingers were slick with blood. “Are you blind, girl? I’m bleeding like a stuck pig. I can’t walk on this.”\n\n“Well,” she said, “I don’t know how you’ll get there, then.”\n\n“You’ll need to carry me.”\n\nSee? thought Mercy. You know your line, and so do I.\n\n“Think so?” asked Arya, sweetly.\n\nRaff the Sweetling looked up sharply as the long thin blade came sliding from her sleeve. She slipped it through his throat beneath the chin, twisted, and ripped it back out sideways with a single smooth slash. A fine red rain followed, and in his eyes the light went out.\n\n“Valar morghulis,” Arya whispered, but Raff was dead and did not hear. She sniffed. I should have helped him down the steps before I killed him. Now I’ll need to drag him all the way to the canal and roll him in. The eels would do the rest.\n\n“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang sadly. A foolish, giddy girl she’d been, but good hearted. She would miss her, and she would miss Daena and the Snapper and the rest, even Izembaro and Bobono. This would make trouble for the Sealord and the envoy with the chicken on his chest, she did not doubt.\n\nShe would think about that later, though. Just now, there was no time. I had best run. Mercy still had some lines to say, her first lines and her last, and Izembaro would have her pretty little empty head if she were late for her own rape.\n","slug":"MERCY","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.497Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vks8001epmnk9w7udmds","content":"<h2 id=\"mercye--excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter\">MERCYE--EXCERPT FROM\nTHE WINDS OF WINTER</h2>\n<p>She woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.</p>\n<p>The smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her\nnightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running\nthrough some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on\nthe scent of prey.</p>\n<p>Half-light filled the room, grey and gloomy. Shivering, she sat up in\nbed and ran a hand across her scalp. Stubble bristled against her palm.\nI need to shave before Izembaro sees. Mercy, I’m Mercy, and tonight I’ll\nbe raped and murdered. Her true name was Mercedene, but Mercy was all\nanyone ever called her… <span id=\"more\"></span> Except in dreams. She took a breath\nto quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of what she’d\ndreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it,\nthough, and a full moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she\nran.</p>\n<p>She had fastened the shutters back so the morning sun might wake her.\nBut there was no sun outside the window of Mercy’s little room, only a\nwall of shifting grey fog. The air had grown chilly… and a good thing,\nelse she might have slept all day. It would be just like Mercy to sleep\nthrough her own rape.</p>\n<p>Gooseprickles covered her legs. Her coverlet had twisted around her\nlike a snake. She unwound it, threw the blanket to the bare plank floor\nand padded naked to the window. Braavos was lost in fog. She could see\nthe green water of the little canal below, the cobbled stone street that\nran beneath her building, two arches of the mossy bridge… but the far\nend of the bridge vanished in greyness, and of the buildings across the\ncanal only a few vague lights remained. She heard a soft splash as a\nserpent boat emerged beneath the bridge’s central arch. “What hour?”\nMercy called down to the man who stood by the snake’s uplifted tail,\npushing her onward with his pole.</p>\n<p>The waterman gazed up, searching for the voice. “Four, by the Titan’s\nroar.” His words echoed hollowly off the swirling green waters and the\nwalls of unseen buildings.</p>\n<p>She was not late, not yet, but she should not dawdle. Mercy was a\nhappy soul and a hard worker, but seldom timely. That would not serve\ntonight. The envoy from Westeros was expected at the Gate this evening,\nand Izembaro would be in no mood to hear excuses, even if she served\nthem up with a sweet smile.</p>\n<p>She had filled her basin from the canal last night before she went to\nsleep, preferring the brackish water to the slimy green rainwater\nstewing in the cistern out back. Dipping a rough cloth, she washed\nherself head to heel, standing on one leg at a time to scrub her\ncalloused feet. After that she found her razor. A bare scalp helped the\nwigs fit better, Izembaro claimed.</p>\n<p>She shaved, donned her smallclothes, and slipped a shapeless brown\nwool dress down over her head. One of her stockings needed mending, she\nsaw as she pulled it up. She would ask the Snapper for help; her own\nsewing was so wretched that the wardrobe mistress usually took pity on\nher. Else I could filtch a nicer pair from wardrobe. That was risky,\nthough. Izembaro hated it when the mummers wore his costumes in the\nstreets.Except for Wendeyne. Give Izembaro’s cock a little suck and a\ngirl can wear any costume that she wants. Mercy was not so foolish as\nall that. Daena had warned her. “Girls who start down that road wind up\non the Ship, where every man in the pit knows he can have any pretty\nthing he might see up on the stage, if his purse is plump enough.”</p>\n<p>Her boots were lumps of old brown leather mottled with saltstains and\ncracked from long wear, her belt a length of hempen rope dyed blue. She\nknotted it about her waist, and hung a knife on her right hip and a coin\npouch on her left. Last of all she threw her cloak across her shoulders.\nIt was a real mummer’s cloak, purple wool lined in red silk, with a hood\nto keep the rain off, and three secret pockets too. She’d hid some coins\nin one of those, an iron key in another, a blade in the last. A real\nblade, not a fruit knife like the one on her hip, but it did not belong\nto Mercy, no more than her other treasures did. The fruit knife belonged\nto Mercy. She was made for eating fruit, for smiling and joking, for\nworking hard and doing as she was told.</p>\n<p>“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang as she descended the wooden stair to\nthe street. The handrail was splintery, the steps steep, and there were\nfive flights, but that was why she’d gotten the room so cheap. That, and\nMercy’s smile. She might be bald and skinny, but Mercy had a pretty\nsmile, and a certain grace. Even Izembaro agreed that she was graceful.\nShe was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with\nfeet instead of wings the way was longer. Braavos was a crooked city.\nThe streets were crooked, the alleys were crookeder, and the canals were\ncrookedest of all. Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the\nRagman’s Road along the Outer Harbor, where she had the sea before her\nand the sky above, and a clear view across the Great Lagoon to the\nArsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail\nher as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of tarry\nIbbenese whalers and big-bellied Westerosi cogs. Mercy could not always\nunderstand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes\nshe would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if\nthey had the coin.</p>\n<p>The long way also took her across the Bridge of Eyes with its carved\nstone faces. From the top of its span, she could look through the arches\nand see all the city: the green copper domes of the Hall of Truth, the\nmasts rising like a forest from the Purple Harbor, the tall towers of\nthe mighty, the golden thunderbolt turning on its spire atop the\nSealord’s Palace… even the Titan’s bronze shoulders, off across the dark\ngreen waters. But that was only when the sun was shining down on\nBraavos. If the fog was thick there was nothing to see but grey, so\ntoday Mercy chose the shorter route to save some wear on her poor\ncracked boots.</p>\n<p>The mists seemed to part before her and close up again as she passed.\nThe cobblestones were wet and slick under her feet. She heard a cat yowl\nplaintively. Braavos was a good city for cats, and they roamed\neverywhere, especially at night. In the fog all cats are grey, Mercy\nthought. In the fog all men are killers.</p>\n<p>She had never seen a thicker fog than this one. On the larger canals,\nthe watermen would be running their serpent boats into one another,\nunable to make out any more than dim lights from the buildings to either\nside of them.</p>\n<p>Mercy passed an old man with a lantern walking the other way, and\nenvied him his light. The street was so gloomy she could scarcely see\nwhere she was stepping. In the humbler parts of the city, the houses,\nshops, and warehouses crowded together, leaning on each other like\ndrunken lovers, their upper stories so close that you could step from\none balcony to the next. The streets below became dark tunnels where\nevery footfall echoed. The small canals were even more hazardous, since\nmany of the houses that lined them had privies jutting out over the\nwater. Izembaro loved to give the Sealord’s speech fromThe Merchant’s\nMelancholy Daughter, about how “here the last Titan yet stands, astride\nthe stony shoulders of his brothers,” but Mercy preferred the scene\nwhere the fat merchant shat on the Sealord’s head as he passed\nunderneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something\nlike that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and\nsailor alike howl with laughter to see it.</p>\n<p>The Gate stood close by the edge of Drowned Town, between the Outer\nHarbor and the Purple Harbor. An old warehouse had burnt there and the\nground was sinking a little more each year, so the land came cheap. Atop\nthe flooded stone foundation of the warehouse, Izembaro raised his\ncavernous playhall. The Dome and the Blue Lantern might enjoy more\nfashionable environs, he told his mummers, but here between the harbors\nthey would never lack for sailors and whores to fill their pit. The Ship\nwas close by, still pulling handsome crowds to the quay where she had\nbeen moored for twenty years, he said, and the Gate would flourish\ntoo.</p>\n<p>Time had proved him right. The Gate’s stage had developed a tilt as\nthe building settled, their costumes were prone to mildew, and water\nsnakes nested in the flooded cellar, but none of that troubled the\nmummers so long as the house was full.</p>\n<p>The last bridge was made of rope and raw planks, and seemed to\ndissolve into nothingness, but that was only the fog. Mercy scampered\nacross, her heels ringing on the wood. The fog opened before her like a\ntattered grey curtain to reveal the playhouse. Buttery yellow light\nspilled from the doors, and Mercy could hear voices from within. Beside\nthe entrance, Big Brusco had painted over the title of the last show,\nand writtenThe Bloody Hand in its place in huge red letters. He was\npainting a bloody hand beneath the words, for those who could not read.\nMercy stopped to have a look. “That’s a nice hand,” she told him.</p>\n<p>“Thumb’s crooked.” Brusco dabbed at it with his brush. “King o’ the\nMummers been asking after you.”</p>\n<p>“It was so dark I slept and slept.” When Izembaro had first dubbed\nhimself the King of the Mummers, the company had taken a wicked pleasure\nin it, savoring the outrage of their rivals from the Dome and the Blue\nLantern. Of late, though, Izembaro had begun to take his title too\nseriously. “He will only play kings now,” Marro said, rolling his eyes,\n“and if the play has no king in it, he would sooner not stage it at\nall.”</p>\n<p>The Bloody Hand offered two kings, the fat one and the boy. Izembaro\nwould play the fat one. It was not a large part, but he had a fine\nspeech as he lay dying, and a splendid fight with a demonic boar before\nthat. Phario Forel had written it, and he had the bloodiest quill of all\nof Braavos.</p>\n<p>Mercy found the company assembled behind the stage, and slipped in\nbetween Daena and the Snapper at the back, hoping her late arrival would\ngo unnoticed. Izembaro was telling everyone that he expected the Gate to\nbe packed to the rafters this evening, despite the fog. “The King of\nWesteros is sending his envoy to do homage to the King of the Mummers\ntonight,” he told his troupe. “We will not disappoint our fellow\nmonarch.”</p>\n<p>“We?” said the Snapper, who did all the costumes for the mummers. “Is\nthere more than one of him, now?”</p>\n<p>“He’s fat enough to count for two,” whispered Bobono. Every mummer’s\ntroupe had to have a dwarf. He was theirs. When he saw Mercy, he gave\nher a leer. “Oho,” he said, “there she is. Is the little girl all ready\nfor her rape?” He smacked his lips.</p>\n<p>The Snapper smacked him in the head. “Be quiet.”</p>\n<p>The King of the Mummers ignored the brief commotion. He was still\ntalking, telling the mummers how magnificent they must be. Besides the\nWesterosi envoy, there would be keyholders in the crowd this evening,\nand famous courtesans as well. He did not intend for them to leave with\na poor opinion of the Gate. “It shall go ill for any man who fails me,”\nhe promised, a threat he borrowed from the speech Prince Garin gives on\nthe eve of battle in Wroth of the Dragonlords, Phario Forel’s first\nplay.</p>\n<p>By the time Izembaro finally finished speaking, less than an hour\nremained before the show, and the mummers were all frantic and fretful\nby turns. The Gate rang to the sound of Mercy’s name.</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” her friend Daena implored, “Lady Stork has stepped on the\nhem of her gown again. Come help me sew it up.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” the Stranger called, “bring the bloody paste, my horn is\ncoming loose.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” boomed Izembaro the Great himself, “what have you done with\nmy crown, girl? I cannot make my entrance without my crown. How shall\nthey know that I’m a king?”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” squeaked the dwarf Bobono, “Mercy, something’s amiss with my\nlaces, my cock keeps flopping out.”</p>\n<p>She fetched the sticky paste and fastened the Stranger’s left horn\nback onto his forehead. She found Izembaro’s crown in the privy where he\nalways left it and helped him pin it to his wig, and then ran for needle\nand thread so the Snapper could sew the lace hem back onto the\ncloth-of-gold gown that the queen would wear in the wedding scene.</p>\n<p>And Bobono’s cock was indeed flopping out. It was made to flop out,\nfor the rape. What a hideous thing, Mercy thought as she knelt before\nthe dwarf to fix him. The cock was a foot long and as thick as her arm,\nbig enough to be seen from the highest balcony. The dyer had done a poor\njob with the leather, though; the thing was a mottled pink and white,\nwith a bulbous head the color of a plum. Mercy pushed it back into\nBobono’s breeches and laced him back up. “Mercy,” he sang as she tied\nhim tight, “Mercy, Mercy, come to my room tonight and make a man of\nme.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll make a eunuch of you if you keep unlacing yourself just so I’ll\nfiddle with your crotch.”</p>\n<p>“We were meant to be together, Mercy,” Bobono insisted. “Look, we’re\njust the same height.”</p>\n<p>“Only when I’m on my knees. Do you remember your first line?” It had\nonly been a fortnight since the dwarf had lurched onto stage in his cups\nand opened The Anguish of the Archon with the grumpkin’s speech from The\nMerchant’s Lusty Lady. Izembaro would skin him alive if he made such a\nblunder again, and never mind how hard it was to find a good dwarf.</p>\n<p>“What are we playing, Mercy?” Bobono asked innocently.</p>\n<p>He is teasing me, Mercy thought. He’s not drunk tonight, he knows the\nshow perfectly well. “We are doing Phario’s new Bloody Hand, in honor of\nthe envoy from the Seven Kingdoms.”</p>\n<p>“Now I recall.” Bobono lowered his voice to a sinister croak. “The\nseven-faced god has cheated me,” he said. “My noble sire he made of\npurest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed\nof darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude\nshape you see before you.” With that, he grabbed at her chest, fumbling\nfor a nipple. “You have no titties. How can I rape a girl with no\ntitties?”</p>\n<p>She caught his nose between her thumb and forefinger and twisted.\n“You’ll have no nose until you get your hands off me.”</p>\n<p>“Owwwww,” the dwarf squealed, releasing her.</p>\n<p>“I’ll grow titties in a year or two.” Mercy rose, to tower over the\nlittle man. “But you’ll never grow another nose. You think of that,\nbefore you touch me there.”</p>\n<p>Bobono rubbed his tender nose. “There’s no need to get so shy. I’ll\nbe raping you soon enough.”</p>\n<p>“Not until the second act.”</p>\n<p>“I always give Wendeyne’s titties a nice squeeze when I rape her in\nThe Anguish of the Archon,” the dwarf complained. “She likes it, and the\npit does too. You have to please the pit.”</p>\n<p>That was one of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” as he liked to call them. You\nhave to please the pit. “I bet it would please the pit if I ripped off\nthe dwarf’s cock and beat him about the head with it,” Mercy replied.\n“That’s something they won’t have seen before.” Always give them\nsomething they haven’t seen before was another of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,”\nand one that Bobono had no easy answer for. “There, you’re done,” Mercy\nannounced. “Now see if you can keep in your breeches till it’s\nneeded.”</p>\n<p>Izembaro was calling for her again. Now he could not find his boar\nspear. Mercy found it for him, helped Big Brusco don his boar suit,\nchecked the trick daggers just to make certain no one had replaced one\nwith a real blade (someone had done that at the Dome once, and a mummer\nhad died), and poured Lady Stork the little nip of wine she liked to\nhave before each play. When all the cries of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy”\nfinally died away, she stole a moment for a quick peek out into the\nhouse.</p>\n<p>The pit was as full as ever she’d seen it, and they were enjoying\nthemselves already, joking and jostling, eating and drinking. She saw a\npeddler selling chunks of cheese, ripping them off the wheel with his\nfingers whenever he found a buyer. A woman had a bag of wrinkled apples.\nSkins of wine were being passed from hand to hand, some girls were\nselling kisses, and one sailor was playing the sea pipes. The sad-eyed\nlittle man called Quill stood in the back, come to see what he could\nsteal for one of his own plays. Cossomo the Conjurer had come as well,\nand on his arm was Yna, the one-eyed whore from the Happy Port, but\nMercy could not know those two, and they would not know Mercy. Daena\nrecognized some Gate regulars in the crowd, and pointed them out for\nher; the dyer Dellono with his pinched white face and mottled purple\nhands, Galeo the sausage-maker in his greasy leather apron, tall Tomarro\nwith his pet rat on his shoulder. “Tomarro best not let Galeo see that\nrat,” Daena warned. “That’s the only meat he puts in them sausages, I\nhear.” Mercy covered her mouth and laughed.</p>\n<p>The balconies were filling too. The first and third levels were for\nmerchants and captains and other respectable folk. The bravos preferred\nthe fourth and highest, where the seats were cheapest. It was a riot of\nbright color up there, while down below more somber shades held sway.\nThe second balcony was cut up into private boxes where the mighty could\ncomport themselves in comfort and privacy, safely apart from the\nvulgarity above and below. They had the best view of the stage, and\nservants to bring them food, wine, cushions, whatever they might desire.\nIt was rare to find the second balcony more than half full at the Gate;\nsuch of the mighty who relished a night of mummery were more inclined to\nvisit the Dome or the Blue Lantern, where the offerings were considered\nsubtler and more poetic.</p>\n<p>This night was different, though, no doubt on account of the\nWesterosi envoy. In one box sat three scions of Otharys, each\naccompanied by a famous courtesan; Prestayn sat alone, a man so ancient\nthat you wondered how he ever reached his seat; Torone and Pranelis\nshared a box, as they shared an uncomfortable alliance; the Third Sword\nwas hosting a half-dozen friends.</p>\n<p>“I count five keyholders,” said Daena.</p>\n<p>“Bessaro is so fat you ought to count him twice,” Mercy replied,\ngiggling. Izembaro had a belly on him, but compared to Bessaro he was as\nlithe as a willow. The keyholder was so big he needed a special seat,\nthrice the size of a common chair.</p>\n<p>“They’re all fat, them Reyaans,” Daena said. “Bellies as big as their\nships. You should have seen the father. He made this one look small. One\ntime he was summoned to the Hall of Truth to vote, but when he stepped\nonto his barge it sank.” She clutched Mercy by the elbow. “Look, the\nSealord’s box.” The Sealord had never visited the Gate, but Izembaro\nnamed a box for him anyway, the largest and most opulent in the house.\n“That must be the Westerosi envoy. Have you ever seen such clothes on an\nold man? And look, he’s brought the Black Pearl!”</p>\n<p>The envoy was slight and balding, with a funny grey wisp of a beard\ngrowing from his chin. His cloak was yellow velvet, and his breeches.\nHis doublet was a blue so bright it almost made Mercy’s eyes water. Upon\nhis breast a shield had been embroidered in yellow thread, and on the\nshield was a proud blue rooster picked out in lapis lazuli. One of his\nguards helped him to his seat, while two others stood behind him in the\nback of the box.</p>\n<p>The woman with him could not have been more than a third his age. She\nwas so lovely that the lamps seemed to burn brighter when she passed.\nShe had dressed in a low-cut gown of pale yellow silk, startling against\nthe light brown of her skin. Her black hair was bound up in a net of\nspun gold, and a jet-and-gold necklace brushed against the top of her\nfull breasts. As they watched, she leaned close to the envoy and\nwhispered something in his ear that made him laugh. “They should call\nher the Brown Pearl,” Mercy said to Daena. “She’s more brown than\nblack.”</p>\n<p>“The first Black Pearl was black as a pot of ink,” said Daena. “She\nwas a pirate queen, fathered by a Sealord’s son on a princess from the\nSummer Isles. A dragon king from Westeros took her for his lover.”</p>\n<p>“I would like to see a dragon,” Mercy said wistfully. “Why does the\nenvoy have a chicken on his chest?”</p>\n<p>Daena howled. “Mercy, don’t you know anything? It’s his siggle. In\nthe Sunset Kingdoms all the lords have siggles. Some have flowers, some\nhave fish, some have bears and elks and other things. See, the envoy’s\nguards are wearing lions.”</p>\n<p>It was true. There were four guards; big, hard-looking men in\nringmail, with heavy Westerosi longswords sheathed at their hips. Their\ncrimson cloaks were bordered in whorls of gold, and golden lions with\nred garnet eyes clasped each cloak at the shoulder. When Mercy glanced\nat the faces beneath the gilded, lion-crested helm, her belly gave a\nquiver.The gods have given me a gift. Her fingers clutched hard at\nDaena’s arm. “That guard. The one on the end, behind the Black\nPearl.”</p>\n<p>“What of him? Do you know him?”</p>\n<p>“No.” Mercy had been born and bred in Braavos, how could she know\nsome Westerosi? She had to think a moment. “It’s only… well, he’s fair\nto look on, don’t you think?” He was, in a rough-hewn way, though his\neyes were hard.</p>\n<p>Daena shrugged. “He’s very old. Not so old as the other ones, but… he\ncould be thirty. And Westerosi. They’re terrible savages, Mercy. Best\nstay well away from his sort.”</p>\n<p>“Stay away?” Mercy giggled. She was a giggly sort of girl, was Mercy.\n“No. I’ve got to get closer.” She gave Daena a squeeze and said, “If the\nSnapper comes looking for me, tell her that I went off to read my lines\nagain.” She only had a few, and most were just, “Oh, no, no, no,” and\n“Don’t, oh don’t, don’t touch me,” and “Please, m’lord, I am still a\nmaiden,” but this was the first time Izembaro had given her any lines at\nall, so it was only to be expected that poor Mercy would want to get\nthem right.</p>\n<p>The envoy from the Seven Kingdoms had taken two of his guards into\nhis box to stand behind him and the Black Pearl, but the other two had\nbeen posted just outside the door to make certain he was not disturbed.\nThey were talking quietly in the Common Tongue of Westeros as she\nslipped up silently behind them in the darkened passage. That was not a\nlanguage Mercy knew.</p>\n<p>“Seven hells, this place is damp,” she heard her guard complain. “I’m\nchilled to the bones. Where are the bloody orange trees? I always heard\nthere were orange trees in the Free Cities. Lemons and limes.\nPomegranates. Hot peppers, warm nights, girls with bare bellies. Where\nare the bare-bellied girls, I ask you?”</p>\n<p>“Down in Lys, and Myr, and Old Volantis,” the other guard replied. He\nwas an older man, big-bellied and grizzled. “I went to Lys with Lord\nTywin once, when he was Hand to Aerys. Braavos is north of King’s\nLanding, fool. Can’t you read a bloody map?”</p>\n<p>“How long do you think we’ll be here?”</p>\n<p>“Longer than you’d like,” the old man replied. “If he goes back\nwithout the gold the queen will have his head. Besides, I seen that wife\nof his. There’s steps in Casterly Rock she can’t go down for fear she’d\nget stuck, that’s how fat she is. Who’d go back to that, when he has his\nsooty queen?”</p>\n<p>The handsome guardsman grinned. “Don’t suppose he’ll share her with\nus, afterward?”</p>\n<p>“What, are you mad? You think he notices the likes of us? Bloody\nbugger don’t even get our names right half the time. Maybe it was\ndifferent with Clegane.”</p>\n<p>“Ser wasn’t one for mummer shows and fancy whores. When Ser wanted a\nwoman he took one, but sometimes he’d let us have her, after. I wouldn’t\nmind having a taste of that Black Pearl. You think she’s pink between\nher legs?”</p>\n<p>Mercy wanted to hear more, but there was no time. The Bloody Hand was\nabout to start, and the Snapper would be looking for her to help with\ncostumes. Izembaro might be the King of the Mummers, but the Snapper was\nthe one that they all feared. Time enough for her pretty guardsman\nlater.</p>\n<p>The Bloody Hand opened in a lichyard.</p>\n<p>When the dwarf appeared suddenly from behind a wooden tombstone, the\ncrowd began to hiss and curse. Bobono waddled to the front of the stage\nand leered at them. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he began,\nsnarling the words. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he\nmade my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of\nbones and blood and clay… “</p>\n<p>By then Marro had appeared behind him, gaunt and terrible in the\nStranger’s long black robes. His face was black as well, his teeth red\nand shiny with blood, while ivory horns jutted upwards from his brow.\nBobono could not see him, but the balconies could, and now the pit as\nwell. The Gate grew deathly quiet. Marro moved forward silently.</p>\n<p>So did Mercy. The costumes were all hung, and the Snapper was busy\nsewing Daena into her gown for the court scene, so Mercy’s absence\nshould not be noted. Quiet as a shadow, she slipped around the back\nagain, up to where the guardsmen stood outside the envoy’s box. Standing\nin a darkened alcove, still as stone, she had a good look at his face.\nShe studied it carefully, to be sure. Am I too young for him? she\nwondered. Too plain? Too skinny? She hoped he wasn’t the sort of man who\nliked big breasts on a girl. Bobono had been right about her chest. It\nwould be best if I could take him back to my place, have him all to\nmyself. But will he come with me?</p>\n<p>“You think it might be him?” the pretty one was saying.</p>\n<p>“What, did the Others take your wits?”</p>\n<p>“Why not? He’s a dwarf, ain’t he?”</p>\n<p>“The Imp weren’t the only dwarf in the world.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe not, but look here, everyone says how clever he was, true? So\nmaybe he figures the last place his sister would ever look for him would\nbe in some mummer show, making fun of himself. So he does just that, to\ntweak her nose.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, you’re mad.”</p>\n<p>“Well, maybe I’ll follow him after the mummery. Find out for myself.”\nThe guardsman put a hand on the hilt of his sword. “If I’m right, I’ll\nbe a ma lord, and if I’m wrong, well, bleed it, it’s just some dwarf.”\nHe gave a bark of laughter.</p>\n<p>On stage, Bobono was bargaining with Marro’s sinister Stranger. He\nhad a big voice for such a little man, and he made it ring off the\nhighest rafters now. “Give me the cup,” he told the Stranger, “for I\nshall drink deep. And if it tastes of gold and lion’s blood, so much the\nbetter. As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them\nin fear in place of love.”</p>\n<p>Mercy mouthed the last lines along with him. They were better lines\nthan hers, and apt besides. He’ll want me or he won’t, she thought, so\nlet the play begin. She said a silent prayer to the god of many faces,\nslipped out of her alcove, and flounced up to the guardsmen. Mercy,\nMercy, Mercy. “My lords,” she said, “do you speak Braavosi? Oh, please,\ntell me you do.”</p>\n<p>The two guardsmen exchanged a look. “What’s this thing going on\nabout?” the older one asked. “Who is she?”</p>\n<p>“One of the mummers,” said the pretty one. He pushed his fair hair\nback off his brow and smiled at her. “Sorry, sweetling, we don’t speak\nyour gibble-gabble.”</p>\n<p>Fuss and feathers, Mercy thought, they only know the Common Tongue.\nThat was no good. Give it up or go ahead. She could not give it up. She\nwanted him so bad. “I know your tongue, a little,” she lied, with\nMercy’s sweetest smile. “You are lords of Westeros, my friend said.”</p>\n<p>The old one laughed. “Lords? Aye, that’s us.”</p>\n<p>Mercy looked down at her feet, so shy. “Izembaro said to please the\nlords,” she whispered. “If there is anything you want, anything at all…\n“</p>\n<p>The two guardsmen exchanged a look. Then the handsome one reached out\nand touched her breast. “Anything?“</p>\n<p>“You’re disgusting,” said the older man.</p>\n<p>“Why? If this Izembaro wants to be hospitable, it would be rude to\nrefuse.” He gave her nipple a tweak through the fabric of her dress,\njust the way the dwarf had done when she was fixing his cock for him.\n“Mummers are the next best thing to whores.”</p>\n<p>“Might be, but this one is a child.”</p>\n<p>“I am not,” lied Mercy. “I’m a maiden now.”</p>\n<p>“Not for long,” said the comely one. “I’m Lord Rafford, sweetling,\nand I know just what I want. Hike up those skirts now, and lean back\nagainst that wall.”</p>\n<p>“Not here,” Mercy said, brushing his hands away. “Not where the play\nis on. I might cry out, and Izembaro would be mad.”</p>\n<p>“Where, then?”</p>\n<p>“I know a place.”</p>\n<p>The older guard was scowling. “What, you think can just scamper off?\nWhat if his knightliness comes looking for you?”</p>\n<p>“Why would he? He’s got a show to watch. And he’s got his own whore,\nwhy shouldn’t I have mine? This won’t take long.”</p>\n<p>No, she thought, it won’t. Mercy took him by the hand, led him\nthrough the back and down the steps and out into the foggy night. “You\ncould be a mummer, if you wanted,” she told him, as he pressed her up\nagainst the wall of the playhouse.</p>\n<p>“Me?” The guardsman snorted. “Not me, girl. All that bloody talking,\nI wouldn’t remember half of it.”</p>\n<p>“It’s hard at first,” she admitted. “But after a time it comes\neasier. I could teach you to say a line. I could.”</p>\n<p>He grabbed her wrist. “I’ll do the teaching. Time for your first\nlesson.” He pulled her hard against him and kissed her on the lips,\nforcing his tongue into her mouth. It was all wet and slimy, like an\neel. Mercy licked it with her own tongue, then broke away from him,\nbreathless. “Not here. Someone might see. My room’s not far, but hurry.\nI have to be back before the second act, or I’ll miss my rape.”</p>\n<p>He grinned. “No fear o’ that, girl.” But he let her pull him after\nher. Hand in hand, they went racing through the fog, over bridges and\nthrough alleys and up five flights of splintery wooden stairs. The\nguardsman was panting by the time they burst through the door of her\nlittle room. Mercy lit a tallow candle, then danced around at him,\ngiggling. “Oh, now you’re all tired out. I forgot how old you were,\nm’lord. Do you want to take a little nap? Just lie down and close your\neyes, and I’ll come back after the Imp’s done raping me.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not going anywhere.” He pulled her roughly to him. “Get those\nrags off, and I’ll show you how old I am, girl.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” she said. “My name is Mercy. Can you say it?”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” he said. “My name is Raff.”</p>\n<p>“I know.” She slipped her hand between his legs, and felt how hard he\nwas through the wool of his breeches.</p>\n<p>“The laces,” he urged her. “Be a sweet girl and undo them.” Instead\nshe slid her finger down along the inside of his thigh. He gave a grunt.\n“Damn, be careful there, you — “</p>\n<p>Mercy gave a gasp and stepped away, her face confused and frightened.\n“You’rebleeding.”</p>\n<p>“Wha — ” He looked down at himself. “Gods be good. What did you do to\nme, you little cunt?” The red stain spread across his thigh, soaking the\nheavy fabric.</p>\n<p>“Nothing,” Mercy squeaked. “I never… oh, oh, there’s so much blood.\nStop it, stop it, you’re scaring me.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head, a dazed look on his face. When he pressed his hand\nto his thigh, blood squirted through his fingers. It was running down\nhis leg, into his boot. He doesn’t look so comely now, she thought. He\njust looks white and frightened.</p>\n<p>“A towel,” the guardsman gasped. “Bring me a towel, a rag, press down\non it. Gods. I feel dizzy.” His leg was drenched with blood from the\nthigh down. When he tried to put his weight on it, his knee buckled and\nhe fell. “Help me,” he pleaded, as the crotch of his breeches reddened.\n“Mother have mercy, girl. A healer… run and find a healer, quick\nnow.”</p>\n<p>“There’s one on the next canal, but he won’t come. You have to go to\nhim. Can’t you walk?”</p>\n<p>“Walk?” His fingers were slick with blood. “Are you blind, girl? I’m\nbleeding like a stuck pig. I can’t walk on this.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” she said, “I don’t know how you’ll get there, then.”</p>\n<p>“You’ll need to carry me.”</p>\n<p>See? thought Mercy. You know your line, and so do I.</p>\n<p>“Think so?” asked Arya, sweetly.</p>\n<p>Raff the Sweetling looked up sharply as the long thin blade came\nsliding from her sleeve. She slipped it through his throat beneath the\nchin, twisted, and ripped it back out sideways with a single smooth\nslash. A fine red rain followed, and in his eyes the light went out.</p>\n<p>“Valar morghulis,” Arya whispered, but Raff was dead and did not\nhear. She sniffed. I should have helped him down the steps before I\nkilled him. Now I’ll need to drag him all the way to the canal and roll\nhim in. The eels would do the rest.</p>\n<p>“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang sadly. A foolish, giddy girl she’d\nbeen, but good hearted. She would miss her, and she would miss Daena and\nthe Snapper and the rest, even Izembaro and Bobono. This would make\ntrouble for the Sealord and the envoy with the chicken on his chest, she\ndid not doubt.</p>\n<p>She would think about that later, though. Just now, there was no\ntime. I had best run. Mercy still had some lines to say, her first lines\nand her last, and Izembaro would have her pretty little empty head if\nshe were late for her own rape.</p>\n","related_posts":["ALAYNE/","ARIANNE/"],"length":6058,"excerpt":"<h2 id=\"mercye--excerpt-from-the-winds-of-winter\">MERCYE--EXCERPT FROM\nTHE WINDS OF WINTER</h2>\n<p>She woke with a gasp, not knowing who she was, or where.</p>\n<p>The smell of blood was heavy in her nostrils… or was that her\nnightmare, lingering? She had dreamed of wolves again, of running\nthrough some dark pine forest with a great pack at her hells, hard on\nthe scent of prey.</p>\n<p>Half-light filled the room, grey and gloomy. Shivering, she sat up in\nbed and ran a hand across her scalp. Stubble bristled against her palm.\nI need to shave before Izembaro sees. Mercy, I’m Mercy, and tonight I’ll\nbe raped and murdered. Her true name was Mercedene, but Mercy was all\nanyone ever called her…","more":"Except in dreams. She took a breath\nto quiet the howling in her heart, trying to remember more of what she’d\ndreamt, but most of it had gone already. There had been blood in it,\nthough, and a full moon overhead, and a tree that watched her as she\nran.</p>\n<p>She had fastened the shutters back so the morning sun might wake her.\nBut there was no sun outside the window of Mercy’s little room, only a\nwall of shifting grey fog. The air had grown chilly… and a good thing,\nelse she might have slept all day. It would be just like Mercy to sleep\nthrough her own rape.</p>\n<p>Gooseprickles covered her legs. Her coverlet had twisted around her\nlike a snake. She unwound it, threw the blanket to the bare plank floor\nand padded naked to the window. Braavos was lost in fog. She could see\nthe green water of the little canal below, the cobbled stone street that\nran beneath her building, two arches of the mossy bridge… but the far\nend of the bridge vanished in greyness, and of the buildings across the\ncanal only a few vague lights remained. She heard a soft splash as a\nserpent boat emerged beneath the bridge’s central arch. “What hour?”\nMercy called down to the man who stood by the snake’s uplifted tail,\npushing her onward with his pole.</p>\n<p>The waterman gazed up, searching for the voice. “Four, by the Titan’s\nroar.” His words echoed hollowly off the swirling green waters and the\nwalls of unseen buildings.</p>\n<p>She was not late, not yet, but she should not dawdle. Mercy was a\nhappy soul and a hard worker, but seldom timely. That would not serve\ntonight. The envoy from Westeros was expected at the Gate this evening,\nand Izembaro would be in no mood to hear excuses, even if she served\nthem up with a sweet smile.</p>\n<p>She had filled her basin from the canal last night before she went to\nsleep, preferring the brackish water to the slimy green rainwater\nstewing in the cistern out back. Dipping a rough cloth, she washed\nherself head to heel, standing on one leg at a time to scrub her\ncalloused feet. After that she found her razor. A bare scalp helped the\nwigs fit better, Izembaro claimed.</p>\n<p>She shaved, donned her smallclothes, and slipped a shapeless brown\nwool dress down over her head. One of her stockings needed mending, she\nsaw as she pulled it up. She would ask the Snapper for help; her own\nsewing was so wretched that the wardrobe mistress usually took pity on\nher. Else I could filtch a nicer pair from wardrobe. That was risky,\nthough. Izembaro hated it when the mummers wore his costumes in the\nstreets.Except for Wendeyne. Give Izembaro’s cock a little suck and a\ngirl can wear any costume that she wants. Mercy was not so foolish as\nall that. Daena had warned her. “Girls who start down that road wind up\non the Ship, where every man in the pit knows he can have any pretty\nthing he might see up on the stage, if his purse is plump enough.”</p>\n<p>Her boots were lumps of old brown leather mottled with saltstains and\ncracked from long wear, her belt a length of hempen rope dyed blue. She\nknotted it about her waist, and hung a knife on her right hip and a coin\npouch on her left. Last of all she threw her cloak across her shoulders.\nIt was a real mummer’s cloak, purple wool lined in red silk, with a hood\nto keep the rain off, and three secret pockets too. She’d hid some coins\nin one of those, an iron key in another, a blade in the last. A real\nblade, not a fruit knife like the one on her hip, but it did not belong\nto Mercy, no more than her other treasures did. The fruit knife belonged\nto Mercy. She was made for eating fruit, for smiling and joking, for\nworking hard and doing as she was told.</p>\n<p>“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang as she descended the wooden stair to\nthe street. The handrail was splintery, the steps steep, and there were\nfive flights, but that was why she’d gotten the room so cheap. That, and\nMercy’s smile. She might be bald and skinny, but Mercy had a pretty\nsmile, and a certain grace. Even Izembaro agreed that she was graceful.\nShe was not far from the Gate as the crows flies, but for girls with\nfeet instead of wings the way was longer. Braavos was a crooked city.\nThe streets were crooked, the alleys were crookeder, and the canals were\ncrookedest of all. Most days she preferred to go the long way, down the\nRagman’s Road along the Outer Harbor, where she had the sea before her\nand the sky above, and a clear view across the Great Lagoon to the\nArsenal and the piney slopes of Sellagoro’s Shield. Sailors would hail\nher as she passed the docks, calling down from the decks of tarry\nIbbenese whalers and big-bellied Westerosi cogs. Mercy could not always\nunderstand their words, but she knew what they were saying. Sometimes\nshe would smile back and tell them they could find her at the Gate if\nthey had the coin.</p>\n<p>The long way also took her across the Bridge of Eyes with its carved\nstone faces. From the top of its span, she could look through the arches\nand see all the city: the green copper domes of the Hall of Truth, the\nmasts rising like a forest from the Purple Harbor, the tall towers of\nthe mighty, the golden thunderbolt turning on its spire atop the\nSealord’s Palace… even the Titan’s bronze shoulders, off across the dark\ngreen waters. But that was only when the sun was shining down on\nBraavos. If the fog was thick there was nothing to see but grey, so\ntoday Mercy chose the shorter route to save some wear on her poor\ncracked boots.</p>\n<p>The mists seemed to part before her and close up again as she passed.\nThe cobblestones were wet and slick under her feet. She heard a cat yowl\nplaintively. Braavos was a good city for cats, and they roamed\neverywhere, especially at night. In the fog all cats are grey, Mercy\nthought. In the fog all men are killers.</p>\n<p>She had never seen a thicker fog than this one. On the larger canals,\nthe watermen would be running their serpent boats into one another,\nunable to make out any more than dim lights from the buildings to either\nside of them.</p>\n<p>Mercy passed an old man with a lantern walking the other way, and\nenvied him his light. The street was so gloomy she could scarcely see\nwhere she was stepping. In the humbler parts of the city, the houses,\nshops, and warehouses crowded together, leaning on each other like\ndrunken lovers, their upper stories so close that you could step from\none balcony to the next. The streets below became dark tunnels where\nevery footfall echoed. The small canals were even more hazardous, since\nmany of the houses that lined them had privies jutting out over the\nwater. Izembaro loved to give the Sealord’s speech fromThe Merchant’s\nMelancholy Daughter, about how “here the last Titan yet stands, astride\nthe stony shoulders of his brothers,” but Mercy preferred the scene\nwhere the fat merchant shat on the Sealord’s head as he passed\nunderneath in his gold-and-purple barge. Only in Braavos could something\nlike that happen, it was said, and only in Braavos would Sealord and\nsailor alike howl with laughter to see it.</p>\n<p>The Gate stood close by the edge of Drowned Town, between the Outer\nHarbor and the Purple Harbor. An old warehouse had burnt there and the\nground was sinking a little more each year, so the land came cheap. Atop\nthe flooded stone foundation of the warehouse, Izembaro raised his\ncavernous playhall. The Dome and the Blue Lantern might enjoy more\nfashionable environs, he told his mummers, but here between the harbors\nthey would never lack for sailors and whores to fill their pit. The Ship\nwas close by, still pulling handsome crowds to the quay where she had\nbeen moored for twenty years, he said, and the Gate would flourish\ntoo.</p>\n<p>Time had proved him right. The Gate’s stage had developed a tilt as\nthe building settled, their costumes were prone to mildew, and water\nsnakes nested in the flooded cellar, but none of that troubled the\nmummers so long as the house was full.</p>\n<p>The last bridge was made of rope and raw planks, and seemed to\ndissolve into nothingness, but that was only the fog. Mercy scampered\nacross, her heels ringing on the wood. The fog opened before her like a\ntattered grey curtain to reveal the playhouse. Buttery yellow light\nspilled from the doors, and Mercy could hear voices from within. Beside\nthe entrance, Big Brusco had painted over the title of the last show,\nand writtenThe Bloody Hand in its place in huge red letters. He was\npainting a bloody hand beneath the words, for those who could not read.\nMercy stopped to have a look. “That’s a nice hand,” she told him.</p>\n<p>“Thumb’s crooked.” Brusco dabbed at it with his brush. “King o’ the\nMummers been asking after you.”</p>\n<p>“It was so dark I slept and slept.” When Izembaro had first dubbed\nhimself the King of the Mummers, the company had taken a wicked pleasure\nin it, savoring the outrage of their rivals from the Dome and the Blue\nLantern. Of late, though, Izembaro had begun to take his title too\nseriously. “He will only play kings now,” Marro said, rolling his eyes,\n“and if the play has no king in it, he would sooner not stage it at\nall.”</p>\n<p>The Bloody Hand offered two kings, the fat one and the boy. Izembaro\nwould play the fat one. It was not a large part, but he had a fine\nspeech as he lay dying, and a splendid fight with a demonic boar before\nthat. Phario Forel had written it, and he had the bloodiest quill of all\nof Braavos.</p>\n<p>Mercy found the company assembled behind the stage, and slipped in\nbetween Daena and the Snapper at the back, hoping her late arrival would\ngo unnoticed. Izembaro was telling everyone that he expected the Gate to\nbe packed to the rafters this evening, despite the fog. “The King of\nWesteros is sending his envoy to do homage to the King of the Mummers\ntonight,” he told his troupe. “We will not disappoint our fellow\nmonarch.”</p>\n<p>“We?” said the Snapper, who did all the costumes for the mummers. “Is\nthere more than one of him, now?”</p>\n<p>“He’s fat enough to count for two,” whispered Bobono. Every mummer’s\ntroupe had to have a dwarf. He was theirs. When he saw Mercy, he gave\nher a leer. “Oho,” he said, “there she is. Is the little girl all ready\nfor her rape?” He smacked his lips.</p>\n<p>The Snapper smacked him in the head. “Be quiet.”</p>\n<p>The King of the Mummers ignored the brief commotion. He was still\ntalking, telling the mummers how magnificent they must be. Besides the\nWesterosi envoy, there would be keyholders in the crowd this evening,\nand famous courtesans as well. He did not intend for them to leave with\na poor opinion of the Gate. “It shall go ill for any man who fails me,”\nhe promised, a threat he borrowed from the speech Prince Garin gives on\nthe eve of battle in Wroth of the Dragonlords, Phario Forel’s first\nplay.</p>\n<p>By the time Izembaro finally finished speaking, less than an hour\nremained before the show, and the mummers were all frantic and fretful\nby turns. The Gate rang to the sound of Mercy’s name.</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” her friend Daena implored, “Lady Stork has stepped on the\nhem of her gown again. Come help me sew it up.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” the Stranger called, “bring the bloody paste, my horn is\ncoming loose.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” boomed Izembaro the Great himself, “what have you done with\nmy crown, girl? I cannot make my entrance without my crown. How shall\nthey know that I’m a king?”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” squeaked the dwarf Bobono, “Mercy, something’s amiss with my\nlaces, my cock keeps flopping out.”</p>\n<p>She fetched the sticky paste and fastened the Stranger’s left horn\nback onto his forehead. She found Izembaro’s crown in the privy where he\nalways left it and helped him pin it to his wig, and then ran for needle\nand thread so the Snapper could sew the lace hem back onto the\ncloth-of-gold gown that the queen would wear in the wedding scene.</p>\n<p>And Bobono’s cock was indeed flopping out. It was made to flop out,\nfor the rape. What a hideous thing, Mercy thought as she knelt before\nthe dwarf to fix him. The cock was a foot long and as thick as her arm,\nbig enough to be seen from the highest balcony. The dyer had done a poor\njob with the leather, though; the thing was a mottled pink and white,\nwith a bulbous head the color of a plum. Mercy pushed it back into\nBobono’s breeches and laced him back up. “Mercy,” he sang as she tied\nhim tight, “Mercy, Mercy, come to my room tonight and make a man of\nme.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll make a eunuch of you if you keep unlacing yourself just so I’ll\nfiddle with your crotch.”</p>\n<p>“We were meant to be together, Mercy,” Bobono insisted. “Look, we’re\njust the same height.”</p>\n<p>“Only when I’m on my knees. Do you remember your first line?” It had\nonly been a fortnight since the dwarf had lurched onto stage in his cups\nand opened The Anguish of the Archon with the grumpkin’s speech from The\nMerchant’s Lusty Lady. Izembaro would skin him alive if he made such a\nblunder again, and never mind how hard it was to find a good dwarf.</p>\n<p>“What are we playing, Mercy?” Bobono asked innocently.</p>\n<p>He is teasing me, Mercy thought. He’s not drunk tonight, he knows the\nshow perfectly well. “We are doing Phario’s new Bloody Hand, in honor of\nthe envoy from the Seven Kingdoms.”</p>\n<p>“Now I recall.” Bobono lowered his voice to a sinister croak. “The\nseven-faced god has cheated me,” he said. “My noble sire he made of\npurest gold, and gold he made my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed\nof darker stuff, of bones and blood and clay, twisted into this rude\nshape you see before you.” With that, he grabbed at her chest, fumbling\nfor a nipple. “You have no titties. How can I rape a girl with no\ntitties?”</p>\n<p>She caught his nose between her thumb and forefinger and twisted.\n“You’ll have no nose until you get your hands off me.”</p>\n<p>“Owwwww,” the dwarf squealed, releasing her.</p>\n<p>“I’ll grow titties in a year or two.” Mercy rose, to tower over the\nlittle man. “But you’ll never grow another nose. You think of that,\nbefore you touch me there.”</p>\n<p>Bobono rubbed his tender nose. “There’s no need to get so shy. I’ll\nbe raping you soon enough.”</p>\n<p>“Not until the second act.”</p>\n<p>“I always give Wendeyne’s titties a nice squeeze when I rape her in\nThe Anguish of the Archon,” the dwarf complained. “She likes it, and the\npit does too. You have to please the pit.”</p>\n<p>That was one of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,” as he liked to call them. You\nhave to please the pit. “I bet it would please the pit if I ripped off\nthe dwarf’s cock and beat him about the head with it,” Mercy replied.\n“That’s something they won’t have seen before.” Always give them\nsomething they haven’t seen before was another of Izembaro’s “wisdoms,”\nand one that Bobono had no easy answer for. “There, you’re done,” Mercy\nannounced. “Now see if you can keep in your breeches till it’s\nneeded.”</p>\n<p>Izembaro was calling for her again. Now he could not find his boar\nspear. Mercy found it for him, helped Big Brusco don his boar suit,\nchecked the trick daggers just to make certain no one had replaced one\nwith a real blade (someone had done that at the Dome once, and a mummer\nhad died), and poured Lady Stork the little nip of wine she liked to\nhave before each play. When all the cries of “Mercy, Mercy, Mercy”\nfinally died away, she stole a moment for a quick peek out into the\nhouse.</p>\n<p>The pit was as full as ever she’d seen it, and they were enjoying\nthemselves already, joking and jostling, eating and drinking. She saw a\npeddler selling chunks of cheese, ripping them off the wheel with his\nfingers whenever he found a buyer. A woman had a bag of wrinkled apples.\nSkins of wine were being passed from hand to hand, some girls were\nselling kisses, and one sailor was playing the sea pipes. The sad-eyed\nlittle man called Quill stood in the back, come to see what he could\nsteal for one of his own plays. Cossomo the Conjurer had come as well,\nand on his arm was Yna, the one-eyed whore from the Happy Port, but\nMercy could not know those two, and they would not know Mercy. Daena\nrecognized some Gate regulars in the crowd, and pointed them out for\nher; the dyer Dellono with his pinched white face and mottled purple\nhands, Galeo the sausage-maker in his greasy leather apron, tall Tomarro\nwith his pet rat on his shoulder. “Tomarro best not let Galeo see that\nrat,” Daena warned. “That’s the only meat he puts in them sausages, I\nhear.” Mercy covered her mouth and laughed.</p>\n<p>The balconies were filling too. The first and third levels were for\nmerchants and captains and other respectable folk. The bravos preferred\nthe fourth and highest, where the seats were cheapest. It was a riot of\nbright color up there, while down below more somber shades held sway.\nThe second balcony was cut up into private boxes where the mighty could\ncomport themselves in comfort and privacy, safely apart from the\nvulgarity above and below. They had the best view of the stage, and\nservants to bring them food, wine, cushions, whatever they might desire.\nIt was rare to find the second balcony more than half full at the Gate;\nsuch of the mighty who relished a night of mummery were more inclined to\nvisit the Dome or the Blue Lantern, where the offerings were considered\nsubtler and more poetic.</p>\n<p>This night was different, though, no doubt on account of the\nWesterosi envoy. In one box sat three scions of Otharys, each\naccompanied by a famous courtesan; Prestayn sat alone, a man so ancient\nthat you wondered how he ever reached his seat; Torone and Pranelis\nshared a box, as they shared an uncomfortable alliance; the Third Sword\nwas hosting a half-dozen friends.</p>\n<p>“I count five keyholders,” said Daena.</p>\n<p>“Bessaro is so fat you ought to count him twice,” Mercy replied,\ngiggling. Izembaro had a belly on him, but compared to Bessaro he was as\nlithe as a willow. The keyholder was so big he needed a special seat,\nthrice the size of a common chair.</p>\n<p>“They’re all fat, them Reyaans,” Daena said. “Bellies as big as their\nships. You should have seen the father. He made this one look small. One\ntime he was summoned to the Hall of Truth to vote, but when he stepped\nonto his barge it sank.” She clutched Mercy by the elbow. “Look, the\nSealord’s box.” The Sealord had never visited the Gate, but Izembaro\nnamed a box for him anyway, the largest and most opulent in the house.\n“That must be the Westerosi envoy. Have you ever seen such clothes on an\nold man? And look, he’s brought the Black Pearl!”</p>\n<p>The envoy was slight and balding, with a funny grey wisp of a beard\ngrowing from his chin. His cloak was yellow velvet, and his breeches.\nHis doublet was a blue so bright it almost made Mercy’s eyes water. Upon\nhis breast a shield had been embroidered in yellow thread, and on the\nshield was a proud blue rooster picked out in lapis lazuli. One of his\nguards helped him to his seat, while two others stood behind him in the\nback of the box.</p>\n<p>The woman with him could not have been more than a third his age. She\nwas so lovely that the lamps seemed to burn brighter when she passed.\nShe had dressed in a low-cut gown of pale yellow silk, startling against\nthe light brown of her skin. Her black hair was bound up in a net of\nspun gold, and a jet-and-gold necklace brushed against the top of her\nfull breasts. As they watched, she leaned close to the envoy and\nwhispered something in his ear that made him laugh. “They should call\nher the Brown Pearl,” Mercy said to Daena. “She’s more brown than\nblack.”</p>\n<p>“The first Black Pearl was black as a pot of ink,” said Daena. “She\nwas a pirate queen, fathered by a Sealord’s son on a princess from the\nSummer Isles. A dragon king from Westeros took her for his lover.”</p>\n<p>“I would like to see a dragon,” Mercy said wistfully. “Why does the\nenvoy have a chicken on his chest?”</p>\n<p>Daena howled. “Mercy, don’t you know anything? It’s his siggle. In\nthe Sunset Kingdoms all the lords have siggles. Some have flowers, some\nhave fish, some have bears and elks and other things. See, the envoy’s\nguards are wearing lions.”</p>\n<p>It was true. There were four guards; big, hard-looking men in\nringmail, with heavy Westerosi longswords sheathed at their hips. Their\ncrimson cloaks were bordered in whorls of gold, and golden lions with\nred garnet eyes clasped each cloak at the shoulder. When Mercy glanced\nat the faces beneath the gilded, lion-crested helm, her belly gave a\nquiver.The gods have given me a gift. Her fingers clutched hard at\nDaena’s arm. “That guard. The one on the end, behind the Black\nPearl.”</p>\n<p>“What of him? Do you know him?”</p>\n<p>“No.” Mercy had been born and bred in Braavos, how could she know\nsome Westerosi? She had to think a moment. “It’s only… well, he’s fair\nto look on, don’t you think?” He was, in a rough-hewn way, though his\neyes were hard.</p>\n<p>Daena shrugged. “He’s very old. Not so old as the other ones, but… he\ncould be thirty. And Westerosi. They’re terrible savages, Mercy. Best\nstay well away from his sort.”</p>\n<p>“Stay away?” Mercy giggled. She was a giggly sort of girl, was Mercy.\n“No. I’ve got to get closer.” She gave Daena a squeeze and said, “If the\nSnapper comes looking for me, tell her that I went off to read my lines\nagain.” She only had a few, and most were just, “Oh, no, no, no,” and\n“Don’t, oh don’t, don’t touch me,” and “Please, m’lord, I am still a\nmaiden,” but this was the first time Izembaro had given her any lines at\nall, so it was only to be expected that poor Mercy would want to get\nthem right.</p>\n<p>The envoy from the Seven Kingdoms had taken two of his guards into\nhis box to stand behind him and the Black Pearl, but the other two had\nbeen posted just outside the door to make certain he was not disturbed.\nThey were talking quietly in the Common Tongue of Westeros as she\nslipped up silently behind them in the darkened passage. That was not a\nlanguage Mercy knew.</p>\n<p>“Seven hells, this place is damp,” she heard her guard complain. “I’m\nchilled to the bones. Where are the bloody orange trees? I always heard\nthere were orange trees in the Free Cities. Lemons and limes.\nPomegranates. Hot peppers, warm nights, girls with bare bellies. Where\nare the bare-bellied girls, I ask you?”</p>\n<p>“Down in Lys, and Myr, and Old Volantis,” the other guard replied. He\nwas an older man, big-bellied and grizzled. “I went to Lys with Lord\nTywin once, when he was Hand to Aerys. Braavos is north of King’s\nLanding, fool. Can’t you read a bloody map?”</p>\n<p>“How long do you think we’ll be here?”</p>\n<p>“Longer than you’d like,” the old man replied. “If he goes back\nwithout the gold the queen will have his head. Besides, I seen that wife\nof his. There’s steps in Casterly Rock she can’t go down for fear she’d\nget stuck, that’s how fat she is. Who’d go back to that, when he has his\nsooty queen?”</p>\n<p>The handsome guardsman grinned. “Don’t suppose he’ll share her with\nus, afterward?”</p>\n<p>“What, are you mad? You think he notices the likes of us? Bloody\nbugger don’t even get our names right half the time. Maybe it was\ndifferent with Clegane.”</p>\n<p>“Ser wasn’t one for mummer shows and fancy whores. When Ser wanted a\nwoman he took one, but sometimes he’d let us have her, after. I wouldn’t\nmind having a taste of that Black Pearl. You think she’s pink between\nher legs?”</p>\n<p>Mercy wanted to hear more, but there was no time. The Bloody Hand was\nabout to start, and the Snapper would be looking for her to help with\ncostumes. Izembaro might be the King of the Mummers, but the Snapper was\nthe one that they all feared. Time enough for her pretty guardsman\nlater.</p>\n<p>The Bloody Hand opened in a lichyard.</p>\n<p>When the dwarf appeared suddenly from behind a wooden tombstone, the\ncrowd began to hiss and curse. Bobono waddled to the front of the stage\nand leered at them. “The seven-faced god has cheated me,” he began,\nsnarling the words. “My noble sire he made of purest gold, and gold he\nmade my siblings, boy and girl. But I am formed of darker stuff, of\nbones and blood and clay… “</p>\n<p>By then Marro had appeared behind him, gaunt and terrible in the\nStranger’s long black robes. His face was black as well, his teeth red\nand shiny with blood, while ivory horns jutted upwards from his brow.\nBobono could not see him, but the balconies could, and now the pit as\nwell. The Gate grew deathly quiet. Marro moved forward silently.</p>\n<p>So did Mercy. The costumes were all hung, and the Snapper was busy\nsewing Daena into her gown for the court scene, so Mercy’s absence\nshould not be noted. Quiet as a shadow, she slipped around the back\nagain, up to where the guardsmen stood outside the envoy’s box. Standing\nin a darkened alcove, still as stone, she had a good look at his face.\nShe studied it carefully, to be sure. Am I too young for him? she\nwondered. Too plain? Too skinny? She hoped he wasn’t the sort of man who\nliked big breasts on a girl. Bobono had been right about her chest. It\nwould be best if I could take him back to my place, have him all to\nmyself. But will he come with me?</p>\n<p>“You think it might be him?” the pretty one was saying.</p>\n<p>“What, did the Others take your wits?”</p>\n<p>“Why not? He’s a dwarf, ain’t he?”</p>\n<p>“The Imp weren’t the only dwarf in the world.”</p>\n<p>“Maybe not, but look here, everyone says how clever he was, true? So\nmaybe he figures the last place his sister would ever look for him would\nbe in some mummer show, making fun of himself. So he does just that, to\ntweak her nose.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, you’re mad.”</p>\n<p>“Well, maybe I’ll follow him after the mummery. Find out for myself.”\nThe guardsman put a hand on the hilt of his sword. “If I’m right, I’ll\nbe a ma lord, and if I’m wrong, well, bleed it, it’s just some dwarf.”\nHe gave a bark of laughter.</p>\n<p>On stage, Bobono was bargaining with Marro’s sinister Stranger. He\nhad a big voice for such a little man, and he made it ring off the\nhighest rafters now. “Give me the cup,” he told the Stranger, “for I\nshall drink deep. And if it tastes of gold and lion’s blood, so much the\nbetter. As I cannot be the hero, let me be the monster, and lesson them\nin fear in place of love.”</p>\n<p>Mercy mouthed the last lines along with him. They were better lines\nthan hers, and apt besides. He’ll want me or he won’t, she thought, so\nlet the play begin. She said a silent prayer to the god of many faces,\nslipped out of her alcove, and flounced up to the guardsmen. Mercy,\nMercy, Mercy. “My lords,” she said, “do you speak Braavosi? Oh, please,\ntell me you do.”</p>\n<p>The two guardsmen exchanged a look. “What’s this thing going on\nabout?” the older one asked. “Who is she?”</p>\n<p>“One of the mummers,” said the pretty one. He pushed his fair hair\nback off his brow and smiled at her. “Sorry, sweetling, we don’t speak\nyour gibble-gabble.”</p>\n<p>Fuss and feathers, Mercy thought, they only know the Common Tongue.\nThat was no good. Give it up or go ahead. She could not give it up. She\nwanted him so bad. “I know your tongue, a little,” she lied, with\nMercy’s sweetest smile. “You are lords of Westeros, my friend said.”</p>\n<p>The old one laughed. “Lords? Aye, that’s us.”</p>\n<p>Mercy looked down at her feet, so shy. “Izembaro said to please the\nlords,” she whispered. “If there is anything you want, anything at all…\n“</p>\n<p>The two guardsmen exchanged a look. Then the handsome one reached out\nand touched her breast. “Anything?“</p>\n<p>“You’re disgusting,” said the older man.</p>\n<p>“Why? If this Izembaro wants to be hospitable, it would be rude to\nrefuse.” He gave her nipple a tweak through the fabric of her dress,\njust the way the dwarf had done when she was fixing his cock for him.\n“Mummers are the next best thing to whores.”</p>\n<p>“Might be, but this one is a child.”</p>\n<p>“I am not,” lied Mercy. “I’m a maiden now.”</p>\n<p>“Not for long,” said the comely one. “I’m Lord Rafford, sweetling,\nand I know just what I want. Hike up those skirts now, and lean back\nagainst that wall.”</p>\n<p>“Not here,” Mercy said, brushing his hands away. “Not where the play\nis on. I might cry out, and Izembaro would be mad.”</p>\n<p>“Where, then?”</p>\n<p>“I know a place.”</p>\n<p>The older guard was scowling. “What, you think can just scamper off?\nWhat if his knightliness comes looking for you?”</p>\n<p>“Why would he? He’s got a show to watch. And he’s got his own whore,\nwhy shouldn’t I have mine? This won’t take long.”</p>\n<p>No, she thought, it won’t. Mercy took him by the hand, led him\nthrough the back and down the steps and out into the foggy night. “You\ncould be a mummer, if you wanted,” she told him, as he pressed her up\nagainst the wall of the playhouse.</p>\n<p>“Me?” The guardsman snorted. “Not me, girl. All that bloody talking,\nI wouldn’t remember half of it.”</p>\n<p>“It’s hard at first,” she admitted. “But after a time it comes\neasier. I could teach you to say a line. I could.”</p>\n<p>He grabbed her wrist. “I’ll do the teaching. Time for your first\nlesson.” He pulled her hard against him and kissed her on the lips,\nforcing his tongue into her mouth. It was all wet and slimy, like an\neel. Mercy licked it with her own tongue, then broke away from him,\nbreathless. “Not here. Someone might see. My room’s not far, but hurry.\nI have to be back before the second act, or I’ll miss my rape.”</p>\n<p>He grinned. “No fear o’ that, girl.” But he let her pull him after\nher. Hand in hand, they went racing through the fog, over bridges and\nthrough alleys and up five flights of splintery wooden stairs. The\nguardsman was panting by the time they burst through the door of her\nlittle room. Mercy lit a tallow candle, then danced around at him,\ngiggling. “Oh, now you’re all tired out. I forgot how old you were,\nm’lord. Do you want to take a little nap? Just lie down and close your\neyes, and I’ll come back after the Imp’s done raping me.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not going anywhere.” He pulled her roughly to him. “Get those\nrags off, and I’ll show you how old I am, girl.”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” she said. “My name is Mercy. Can you say it?”</p>\n<p>“Mercy,” he said. “My name is Raff.”</p>\n<p>“I know.” She slipped her hand between his legs, and felt how hard he\nwas through the wool of his breeches.</p>\n<p>“The laces,” he urged her. “Be a sweet girl and undo them.” Instead\nshe slid her finger down along the inside of his thigh. He gave a grunt.\n“Damn, be careful there, you — “</p>\n<p>Mercy gave a gasp and stepped away, her face confused and frightened.\n“You’rebleeding.”</p>\n<p>“Wha — ” He looked down at himself. “Gods be good. What did you do to\nme, you little cunt?” The red stain spread across his thigh, soaking the\nheavy fabric.</p>\n<p>“Nothing,” Mercy squeaked. “I never… oh, oh, there’s so much blood.\nStop it, stop it, you’re scaring me.”</p>\n<p>He shook his head, a dazed look on his face. When he pressed his hand\nto his thigh, blood squirted through his fingers. It was running down\nhis leg, into his boot. He doesn’t look so comely now, she thought. He\njust looks white and frightened.</p>\n<p>“A towel,” the guardsman gasped. “Bring me a towel, a rag, press down\non it. Gods. I feel dizzy.” His leg was drenched with blood from the\nthigh down. When he tried to put his weight on it, his knee buckled and\nhe fell. “Help me,” he pleaded, as the crotch of his breeches reddened.\n“Mother have mercy, girl. A healer… run and find a healer, quick\nnow.”</p>\n<p>“There’s one on the next canal, but he won’t come. You have to go to\nhim. Can’t you walk?”</p>\n<p>“Walk?” His fingers were slick with blood. “Are you blind, girl? I’m\nbleeding like a stuck pig. I can’t walk on this.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” she said, “I don’t know how you’ll get there, then.”</p>\n<p>“You’ll need to carry me.”</p>\n<p>See? thought Mercy. You know your line, and so do I.</p>\n<p>“Think so?” asked Arya, sweetly.</p>\n<p>Raff the Sweetling looked up sharply as the long thin blade came\nsliding from her sleeve. She slipped it through his throat beneath the\nchin, twisted, and ripped it back out sideways with a single smooth\nslash. A fine red rain followed, and in his eyes the light went out.</p>\n<p>“Valar morghulis,” Arya whispered, but Raff was dead and did not\nhear. She sniffed. I should have helped him down the steps before I\nkilled him. Now I’ll need to drag him all the way to the canal and roll\nhim in. The eels would do the rest.</p>\n<p>“Mercy, Mercy, Mercy,” she sang sadly. A foolish, giddy girl she’d\nbeen, but good hearted. She would miss her, and she would miss Daena and\nthe Snapper and the rest, even Izembaro and Bobono. This would make\ntrouble for the Sealord and the envoy with the chicken on his chest, she\ndid not doubt.</p>\n<p>She would think about that later, though. Just now, there was no\ntime. I had best run. Mercy still had some lines to say, her first lines\nand her last, and Izembaro would have her pretty little empty head if\nshe were late for her own rape.</p>"},{"title":"Messenger传输大的数据","comments":0,"date":"2021-10-09T06:59:47.000Z","_content":"``Messenger``作为跨进程，是很常用的方法，轻便，已经基于AIDL做了很多的封装了，但是这个方法只能传输比较小的数据，如果要传输大一些的数据咋办呢？可以使用``Bundle.putBinder

Air2，到今天信用卡分期买了新出的MacBook pro。我不晓得我是否应该自豪，因为现在的我已无任何积蓄，即使我终于拥有了传说中的生产力工具了。在决定要买新的电脑的时候，我就问过自己，我究竟想要什么？我已经不愿意去折腾无聊的电脑笔记本了，我需要的也不是一款强劲的游戏本，买下MacBook的那一刻我就告诉我自己，这是一个新的起点，我要的是一件足够好用的简易工具，之前折腾ubuntu，折腾windows，到最后发现，一个趁手的工具对效率的提升是显而易见的。\n\n一个月前，我买了新的域名``www.serbad.net``和``www.serbad.info``,上周才找时间修复了挂在`GitHub page`上的网站的Bug。``Ser Bad``我想我可以解释下是什么意思，``Ser``是一个不存在的词，是J·R·R·马丁大爷创造的，意思是``爵士``的意思，大概是因为我很迷恋那种爵士的绅士风度吧，虽然马丁大爷的作品里面和风度一毛钱关系都没有。既然买了新的域名，我就要想办法把这个域名维护下去，不然的话乱花钱就真的是``Bad``了。\n\n国庆前夕，早上高高兴兴地去上班，晚上回来就失业在家了。所谓的``资本寒冬``大抵就是这个样子的，没想到，该来的还是回来，同一个公司的iOS同事到现在都还没有找到工作。我自己找工作也有点儿急，只要面试过后两天之内没有通知我就基本忽略了，没想到在答应了现在这家公司的第二天之前面试的公司就通知我去上班了，只能遗憾地放弃。想想，自己为什么会答应现在这家公司呢，大概的原因是老板很热情，真心没想到，最近发现是我对工作太没有热情了（手动加一个😓的表情），这就让我开始思考自己以后的人生究竟该怎么走的问题了。\n\n说到底，程序员算什么呢？现在的技术经理是一个``不懂得开发的人``，在他眼里，技术是解决问题的，不管你用什么东西，只有解决了问题才是好的技术，这并没有错，我们现在用到的技术也并不是什么改变世界的技术，并不足以让我们用技术来换钱，这就是很现实的问题，任何公司都是以盈利为导向的，不然话，公司也就无法生存下去。讲道理，在我第一次提到需要时间去完善代码的时候，他说的一句话深深地打击了我```“代码够用就好了，你管人家写的好还是不好，哪怕你写的再好又能怎样，又有谁会看到？”```。是啊，这就是技术人员的悲哀，除了少部分创造出”有价值的”的人，大部分人终其一生都是默默无闻的小员工，没有话语权，没有成就，属于可替代品。我呢？除了完善自己的技术能力以外，我还有什么呢？我的工作是属于可替代的，兴许别人比我做的还要好，我对自己如何定位呢？思考了好久，发现自己无法得到合理的答案，我只能送自己一句话：“完成现阶段作为程序员的主要职责，然后保持适度的技术好奇心，再去拓展其他方面的技能。”，再加一句：“Read the fucking source

一定要保证你简历上的东西是真实，是你会的。\n\n  讲道理，有的人连自己简历上的知识点都回答的不完整，遇到几个简历上写的精通Java，可是却连最基本的Java基础的集合都讲不清楚，实在是不知道那里来的勇气写精通的。对于筛选你来面试的人，一定是觉得你简历合适的，可是如果你乱写，浪费大家时间，你也辛苦白跑一趟，何必呢？\n- 请仔细检查自己简历里面的大小写拼写以及错误。\n\n  一份简历，一定是你看过很多遍的东西，如果连指望你对关乎自己工作的``门面``都检查不好，怎么指望你能够有一个好的代码规范，有一个好的工作习惯呢？甚至有可能，简历上面的东西，是你随意拼凑出来的东西，那更加不能指望你了。\n\n- 如果自己基础不够，请在面试之前，多看看书。\n\n  面试期间，有一个印象很深刻，因为我一开始问了几个基础的问题，然后说自己不会。然后我问他，请把你来之前准备过的东西描述一遍可以吗？他说，来之前没有准备。我的内心。瞬间就有点儿对这个人不看好了，因为我为了面试你，我都要做一些准备的，包括一些我可能记忆不是很深刻的知识点，我都要再去确认一遍细节，可是你居然说你没有准备，没有准备也就罢了，连基础都回答不出来，那不是浪费大家的时间吗？然后，我又挑了他简历上写的几个知识点问了下，然后他又说自己不知道，那我只有``礼貌地``请他离开了。\n- 关于职业规划。\n\n  其中有一个，年龄以及30岁+，可是我当我问他，想做开发组的组长，还是做普通的程序员时，他说都可以。然后问了一些基础的东西，但是没能完美回答上来，然后问了一些团队管理的问题，也回答的有问题。\n\n  之后，我真的是在感慨，程序员这条路走起来并不容易。虽然都知道，大部分人无法做到top10%，但是有的人，年纪一大把却连top60%都做不到，这个时候就开始面临学习能力的下降，竞争力的下降，不得不被市场淘汰掉。然后想想自己，我该如何让自己顺利更快成长呢？\n\n- 基础的算法能力。\n\n  大学教育千奇百怪，居然会遇到有几个人，连冒泡算法都没有听过，你说你一时回答不出来，我可以假装自己原谅你，可是都没有听过，那就真的是说不过去了。\n- 关于几点遗憾。\n\n  其实在面试过程中，也遇到了一些虽然基础薄弱，但是学习意识很强，只是因为自己之前接触的环境，没能给自己指明一条良好的道路。有一个，在我提出问题，表示自己不会的时候，还虚心请教，我都尽我所能给出了回答，要不是因为我被要求找一个经验丰富的工程师，不然的话，我其实蛮想把这个人找来的，虽然我很礼貌表明了我的意思，真心希望他能尽快找到一家愿意收留他的人，也希望我所讲过的话，没有把他带偏。\n\n- 关于在简历中留博客的人。\n\n  关于在简历中留博客的人，是一件很冒险的事情，因为，有些人的博客实在是太过简单了。甚至有的人在2017年还把自己用eclipse写的代码贴上去，这就有点儿说不过去了，我就不说他博客里面贴的代码过于简单了，关键是一眼就能看出来贴的是eclipse上写的代码。这实在无法让人忍受。\n\n  其实，很多公司招聘启事会说希望能留一个博客，是为了让对方有一个技术积累，不会这么多年只写一些简单的业务代码，能对Android的技术提出一些自己的想法，这个很关键，这能看出来一个人是否有技术追求，是否有学习能力，这才是让别人贴博客的原因，绝对不是流于形式，放一篇博客就完事了。\n- 关于自己的反思。\n\n  在面试别人的时候，也不一而足，问的问题也会不一样。比如有的人，我会问``如果有一天Android不行了，你怎么办呢？``，后来我和一个朋友争论过这个问题，他的做法是，在一开始就选一个日后绝对会用的到技术，比如后端的技术。虽然后端的技术也在变革，但是长期来看，后端的Java还是具有相当的生命力的。\n\n  可是，我已经选了Android了，我就不得不面对这种问题，最后我说了一句连我自己都不信的话，Android绝对不会轻易垮掉的。其实问这个问题，我只是想知道对方究竟有没有想过这个问题，回答什么都行，只要逻辑自洽就行，但是绝对不能回答不知道，这代表你对生活得过且过，不会去想尽办法成长。\n\n  当然因为自己经验有限，也会遇到一些没有接触过的东西，那我就只能判断一个大概，因为真的做过的人，是能够做到对于这个东西理解的逻辑不会出现漏洞的。\n\n  也希望自己能够继续努力，多做准备，继续成长。毕竟对于公司而言，只适合能够帮到公司的人。\n\n

讲道理，有的人连自己简历上的知识点都回答的不完整，遇到几个简历上写的精通Java，可是却连最基本的Java基础的集合都讲不清楚，实在是不知道那里来的勇气写精通的。对于筛选你来面试的人，一定是觉得你简历合适的，可是如果你乱写，浪费大家时间，你也辛苦白跑一趟，何必呢？\n- 请仔细检查自己简历里面的大小写拼写以及错误。\n\n  一份简历，一定是你看过很多遍的东西，如果连指望你对关乎自己工作的``门面``都检查不好，怎么指望你能够有一个好的代码规范，有一个好的工作习惯呢？甚至有可能，简历上面的东西，是你随意拼凑出来的东西，那更加不能指望你了。\n\n- 如果自己基础不够，请在面试之前，多看看书。\n\n  面试期间，有一个印象很深刻，因为我一开始问了几个基础的问题，然后说自己不会。然后我问他，请把你来之前准备过的东西描述一遍可以吗？他说，来之前没有准备。我的内心。瞬间就有点儿对这个人不看好了，因为我为了面试你，我都要做一些准备的，包括一些我可能记忆不是很深刻的知识点，我都要再去确认一遍细节，可是你居然说你没有准备，没有准备也就罢了，连基础都回答不出来，那不是浪费大家的时间吗？然后，我又挑了他简历上写的几个知识点问了下，然后他又说自己不知道，那我只有``礼貌地``请他离开了。\n- 关于职业规划。\n\n  其中有一个，年龄以及30岁+，可是我当我问他，想做开发组的组长，还是做普通的程序员时，他说都可以。然后问了一些基础的东西，但是没能完美回答上来，然后问了一些团队管理的问题，也回答的有问题。\n\n  之后，我真的是在感慨，程序员这条路走起来并不容易。虽然都知道，大部分人无法做到top10%，但是有的人，年纪一大把却连top60%都做不到，这个时候就开始面临学习能力的下降，竞争力的下降，不得不被市场淘汰掉。然后想想自己，我该如何让自己顺利更快成长呢？\n\n- 基础的算法能力。\n\n  大学教育千奇百怪，居然会遇到有几个人，连冒泡算法都没有听过，你说你一时回答不出来，我可以假装自己原谅你，可是都没有听过，那就真的是说不过去了。\n- 关于几点遗憾。\n\n  其实在面试过程中，也遇到了一些虽然基础薄弱，但是学习意识很强，只是因为自己之前接触的环境，没能给自己指明一条良好的道路。有一个，在我提出问题，表示自己不会的时候，还虚心请教，我都尽我所能给出了回答，要不是因为我被要求找一个经验丰富的工程师，不然的话，我其实蛮想把这个人找来的，虽然我很礼貌表明了我的意思，真心希望他能尽快找到一家愿意收留他的人，也希望我所讲过的话，没有把他带偏。\n\n-

来进行多线程访问。在官网在介绍这个方法的时候是这样子的：\n<!--more-->\n```\nThis constant was deprecated in API level 23.\nMODE_MULTI_PROCESS does not work reliably in some versions of Android, and furthermore does not provide any mechanism for reconciling concurrent modifications across processes.\nApplications should not attempt to use it.\nInstead, they should use an explicit cross-process data management approach such as ContentProvider.\n\nSharedPreference loading flag: when set, the file on disk will be checked for modification even if the shared preferences instance is already loaded in this process.\nThis behavior is sometimes desired in cases where the application has multiple processes, all writing to the same SharedPreferences file.\nGenerally there are better forms of communication between

id=\"关于技术选型\">关于技术选型</h2>\n<p>对于一个初成长的互联网团队而言，如何选定自己团队需要用的技术是很关键\n1.\n要兼顾团队的实力，我相信有一定量的初创团队在一开始的时候的技术实力一定是很弱的，而且也没有多余的钱去请大牛来帮你开发，如果使用外包的话，如果使用外包的最后一定会遇到一堆的坑，说不定哪天恰好在你高速发展的时候你不得不因为技术原因推到重来。那个时候就真的是欲哭无泪了。\n2.\n另一方面也要考虑后面的可维护性，不然随着业务的扩展，可维护性的降低，代码迭代的越来越艰难，新功能的开发也越来越慢。现在前端、后端、移动端的选择越来越多，之所以出现这么多的选择就是为了快速提高开发效率，分工合作，高度耦合，提高网站或者app的访问速度。\n3.\n不能只使用新的技术，新的技术有可能不稳定，说不定过段时间就被淘汰了。而且太过新颖的技术，网上的教程也很少，甚至有可能连Google都找不到，也不利于新的技术的学习。\n4. 还有最关键的一条，团队才是最重要的。","more":"</p>\n<h2 id=\"关于我的选择\">关于我的选择</h2>\n<p>首先我们的主要目标并不是需要一个强大的后台，主要目标是有一个前台的展示效果，足够的好看，访问速度足够的快就行了，而且，团队里面的技术人员都不是做后台的，我自己平时主要是Android程序员，虽然会Java，可是使用Java来开发后台却是一件麻烦的事情，也不利于团队协作。如果说把前端完全外包出去，一来无法保证开发进度，也无法保证开发质量，也不利于后期的维护。</p>\n<p>经过几天的思考选择，最后我选择了node.js 用到的技术有： - <a\nhref=\"http://www.imooc.com/learn/75\"\ntitle=\"一个视频教学的例子\"><strong>node.js</strong></a>\n主要用于连接前端和后端，也可以单独作为后端来使用，好处就是响应速度更快，网上的教程也足够的多。\n- <strong>express</strong>\n基于node.js的一个MVC的框架，好处就是足够的流行，教程也很多。 - <a\nhref=\"http://www.bootcss.com/\"\ntitle=\"bootstrap的中文教程网站\"><strong>bootstrap</strong></a>\n这是一个前端的展示页面，看了一些实例之后觉得，可以应付我们的前端需求，也很简单，上手也很容易，文杰也应该能够上手,而且最新的<a\nhref=\"http://v3.bootcss.com/css/\"\ntitle=\"关于bootstrap3的介绍\">bootstrap3</a>对于移动端的支持也足够的好。\n- <strong>mysql</strong>\n本来看到有的文章说node.js因为是使用js写的，所以对于MongoDB天然地支持，可是我看了一些文档之后觉得，现在没必要使用MongoDB，对于团队来说学习成本太高了，但是现在我对mysql更熟悉的情况下，贸然使用另一个完全不熟悉的数据库会有很大的风险。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>貌似需要用到语言有

连接到mysql数据库\n\n在这之前先安装正确的npm包：\n```JavaScript\n    npm install mysql\n```\n**mysql** 是一个非常容易使用的模块，它提供了你可能需要的所有功能。安装好后，你需要连接数据库的方法是：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n\nvar connection = mysql.createConnection({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  user: 'your_user',\n  password: 'some_secret',\n  database: 'database'\n})\n\nconnection.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) throw err\n  console.log('You are now connected...')\n})\n```\n<!--more-->\n现在，你可以读写你的数据库了。\n\n## 读写mysql数据库\n\n你已经知道如何去连接你的数据库了，现在让我们看一个简单的例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n\nvar connection = mysql.createConnection({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  user: 'your_user',\n  password: 'some_secret',\n  database: 'database'\n})\n\nconnection.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) throw err\n  console.log('You are now connected...')\n\n  connection.query('CREATE TABLE people(id int primary key, name varchar(255), age int, address text)', function(err, result) {\n    if (err) throw err\n    connection.query('INSERT INTO people (name, age, address) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', ['Larry', '41', 'California, USA'], function(err, result) {\n      if (err) throw err\n      connection.query('SELECT * FROM people', function(err, results) {\n        if (err) throw err\n        console.log(results[0].id)\n        console.log(results[0].name)\n        console.log(results[0].age)\n        console.log(results[0].address)\n      })\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n你能够看到在上面的占位符`?`，它不仅仅使使用起来更容易，而且也是安全的。\n\n## 更换你的 *db.js* 文件\n\n虽然你看到的mysql模块非常容易，但是真实的应用有着更加复杂的需求。这就是为什么在[Connecting and Working with MongoDB](https://www.terlici.com/2015/04/03/mongodb-node-express.html)中，我们创建一个分开的文件db.js来帮助我们管理我们的连接。\n它的作用是无论何时我们不用经常键入凭证来很容易地连接数据库。它的第二个目标就是很容易运行测试。\n\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n  , async = require('async')\n\nvar PRODUCTION_DB = 'app_prod_database'\n  , TEST_DB = 'app_test_database'\n\nexports.MODE_TEST = 'mode_test'\nexports.MODE_PRODUCTION = 'mode_production'\n\nvar state = {\n  pool: null,\n  mode: null,\n}\n\nexports.connect = function(mode, done) {\n  state.pool = mysql.createPool({\n    host: 'localhost',\n    user: 'your_user',\n    password: 'some_secret',\n    database: mode === exports.MODE_PRODUCTION ? PRODUCTION_DB : TEST_DB\n  })\n\n  state.mode = mode\n  done()\n}\n\nexports.get = function() {\n  return state.pool\n}\n\nexports.fixtures = function(data) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  var names = Object.keys(data.tables)\n  async.each(names, function(name, cb) {\n    async.each(data.tables[name], function(row, cb) {\n      var keys = Object.keys(row)\n        , values = keys.map(function(key) { return \"'\" + row[key] + \"'\" })\n\n      pool.query('INSERT INTO ' + name + ' (' + keys.join(',') + ') VALUES (' + values.join(',') + ')', cb)\n    }, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n\nexports.drop = function(tables, done) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  async.each(tables, function(name, cb) {\n    pool.query('DELETE * FROM ' + name, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n```\n这个db.js有点儿比我们之前的要复杂的多。\n\n首先，它提供一种方法去连接数据库。在生产模块和测试模块都能\n去连接。测试模块仅在自动化测试时运行。\n\n然后，有一个`get`方法能够一直提供给你有效的连接，也可以用来查询数据库。而且，你可以去设置密码，其他模块也可以调用这个方法。\n\n最后，有两个方法`fixtures`和`drop`，很容易地去退出测试。\n\n**drop** 清空数据，它将会帮助你的测试数据库在测试之前总是空的。\n\n**fixtures** 使用json对象，加载数据库中的数据，看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar data = {\n  tables: {\n    people: [\n     {id: 1, name: \"John\", age: 32},\n     {id: 2, name: \"Peter\", age: 29},\n    ],\n    cars: [\n      {id: 1, brand: \"Jeep\", model: \"Cherokee\", owner_id: 2},\n      {id: 2, brand: \"BMW\", model: \"X5\", owner_id: 2},\n      {id: 3, brand: \"Volkswagen\",

console.log('Data has been loaded...')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## 使用SQL搭建模块\n\n所有事情准备好了，接下来看看如何在你的应用中使用db.js。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\ncontrollers/\n  comments.js\n  users.js\nmodels/\n  comment.js\n  user.js\nviews/\napp.js\ndb.js\npackage.json\n```\n**app.js** 是应用的入口，也是我们将要设置数据库连接的地方。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('./db')\n\napp.use('/comments', require('./controllers/comments'))\napp.use('/users', require('./controllers/users'))\n\n// Connect to MySQL on start\ndb.connect(db.MODE_PRODUCTION, function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log('Unable to connect to MySQL.')\n    process.exit(1)\n  } else {\n    app.listen(3000, function() {\n      console.log('Listening on port 3000...')\n    })\n  }\n})\n```\n你的应用将会通过这个模块来与数据库交互。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('../db.js')\n\nexports.create = function(userId, text, done) {\n  var values = [userId, text, new Date().toISOString()]\n\n  db.get().query('INSERT INTO comments (user_id, text, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?)', values, function(err, result) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, result.insertId)\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAll = function(done) {\n  db.get().query('SELECT * FROM comments', function (err, rows) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, rows)\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAllByUser = function(userId, done) {\n  db.get().query('SELECT * FROM comments WHERE user_id = ?', userId, function (err, rows) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, rows)\n  })\n}\n```\n正如你看到的db.js是你完全不用带薪连接数据库的问题，甚至不用只用是否是生产环境还是测试环境。\n\n## 为读和写使用不一样的实例\n\n随着你的应用需求的增长，今天，很多应用都是面向读的。这就意味着，人们读数据少于写数据。例如，所有这一类应用的社交网站，通常你的状态只被读一次，但是然后被成千上万的人去读。在这种情况下是通常有一个主要的数据库将接受所有的写,然后同步到一些MySQL实例将只读取请求。当你有更多的用户可以很容易地添加更多数据库去读，你的应用将仍然是非常快的。\n\n但是，如何在我们的初始化中解决这个问题呢？mysql模块 **PoolCluster** 特性非常有用,它可以配置几个实例,然后连接到所有的人。看一个db.js中的例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n  , async = require('async')\n\nvar PRODUCTION_DB = 'app_prod_database'\n  , TEST_DB = 'app_test_database'\n\nexports.MODE_TEST = 'mode_test'\nexports.MODE_PRODUCTION = 'mode_production'\n\nvar state = {\n  pool: null,\n  mode: null,\n}\n\nexports.connect = function(mode, done) {\n  if (mode === exports.MODE_PRODUCTION) {\n    state.pool = mysql.createPoolCluster()\n\n    state.pool.add('WRITE', {\n      host: '192.168.0.5',\n      user: 'your_user',\n      password: 'some_secret',\n      database: PRODUCTION_DB\n    })\n\n    state.pool.add('READ1', {\n      host: '192.168.0.6',\n      user: 'your_user',\n      password: 'some_secret',\n      database: PRODUCTION_DB\n    })\n\n    state.pool.add('READ2', {\n      host: '192.168.0.7',\n      user: 'your_user',\n      password: 'some_secret',\n      database: PRODUCTION_DB\n    })\n  } else {\n    state.pool = mysql.createPool({\n      host: 'localhost',\n      user: 'your_user',\n      password: 'some_secret',\n      database: TEST_DB\n    })\n  }\n\n  state.mode = mode\n  done()\n}\n\nexports.READ = 'read'\nexports.WRITE = 'write'\n\nexports.get = function(type, done) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  if (type === exports.WRITE) {\n    state.pool.getConnection('WRITE', function (err, connection) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, connection)\n    })\n  } else {\n    state.pool.getConnection('READ*', function (err, connection) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, connection)\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nexports.fixtures = function(data) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  var names = Object.keys(data.tables)\n  async.each(names, function(name, cb) {\n    async.each(data.tables[name], function(row, cb) {\n      var keys = Object.keys(row)\n        , values = keys.map(function(key) { return \"'\" + row[key] + \"'\" })\n\n      pool.query('INSERT INTO ' + name + ' (' + keys.join(',') + ') VALUES (' + values.join(',') + ')', cb)\n    }, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n\nexports.drop = function(tables, done) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  async.each(tables, function(name, cb) {\n    pool.query('DELETE * FROM ' + name, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n```\n这里有三处和之前的不一样。\n\n1. 当连接在连接方法在测试模式下,做你之前所做的。然而,当你在生产模式下,添加3个更多的servers。每一个server都有一个名字，第一个是`WRITE`，另外两个是`READ1`和`READ2`。应该很清楚每一个的目的是什么。`READ1`和`READ2`是`WRITE`的奴隶,所以每次有人写数据到`WRITE`,然后很快地对`READ1`和`READ2`可用。\n2. 第二处变化是`get`方法。之前，它会立即返回一个连接。现在，它返回一个连接到回调函数作为第二个参数提供。\n3. 最后一处变化还是在`get`方法。在你连接数据库的时候，你需要告诉连接的类型 **READ** 和 **WRITE**。然后根据名称设置为服务器将提供正确的类型的连接。在这种情况下你可以看到`getConnection`提供一种模式系统,这样您就可以选择适当的数据库\n\n然后让我们看一个使用 **db.js** 的实例：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('../db.js')\n\nexports.create = function(userId, text, done) {\n  var values = [userId, text, new Date().toISOString()]\n\n  db.get(db.WRITE, function(err, connection) {\n    if (err) return done('Database problem')\n\n    connection.query('INSERT INTO comments (user_id, text, date) VALUES(?, ?, ?)', values, function(err, result) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, result.insertId)\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAll = function(done) {\n  db.get(db.READ, function(err, connection) {\n    if (err) return done('Database problem')\n\n    connection.query('SELECT * FROM comments', function (err, rows) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, rows)\n    })\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAllByUser = function(userId, done) {\n  db.get(db.READ, function(err, connection) {\n    if (err) return done('Database problem')\n\n    connection.query('SELECT * FROM comments WHERE user_id = ?', userId, function (err, rows) {\n      if (err) return done(err)\n      done(null, rows)\n    })\n  })\n}\n```\n你也可以创建一个代理连接对象,基于可以查询了解这是一个写或读,然后选择适当的连接。这样你甚至不会改变你的模块。\n\n## 最后\n\n本文翻译了<https://www.terlici.com/2015/08/13/mysql-node-express.html>的大部分，如果有错误，可以留言。\n","source":"_posts/mysql-node-express.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 翻译：如何在Node.js和Express中使用MySql\ndate: 2016-04-15

是一个非常容易使用的模块，它提供了你可能需要的所有功能。安装好后，你需要连接数据库的方法是：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n\nvar connection = mysql.createConnection({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  user: 'your_user',\n  password: 'some_secret',\n  database: 'database'\n})\n\nconnection.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) throw err\n  console.log('You are now connected...')\n})\n```\n<!--more-->\n现在，你可以读写你的数据库了。\n\n## 读写mysql数据库\n\n你已经知道如何去连接你的数据库了，现在让我们看一个简单的例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n\nvar connection = mysql.createConnection({\n  host: 'localhost',\n  user: 'your_user',\n  password: 'some_secret',\n  database: 'database'\n})\n\nconnection.connect(function(err) {\n  if (err) throw err\n  console.log('You are now connected...')\n\n  connection.query('CREATE TABLE people(id int primary key, name varchar(255), age int, address text)', function(err, result) {\n    if (err) throw err\n    connection.query('INSERT INTO people (name, age, address) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', ['Larry', '41', 'California, USA'], function(err, result) {\n      if (err) throw err\n      connection.query('SELECT * FROM people', function(err, results) {\n        if (err) throw err\n        console.log(results[0].id)\n        console.log(results[0].name)\n        console.log(results[0].age)\n        console.log(results[0].address)\n      })\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n你能够看到在上面的占位符`?`，它不仅仅使使用起来更容易，而且也是安全的。\n\n## 更换你的 *db.js* 文件\n\n虽然你看到的mysql模块非常容易，但是真实的应用有着更加复杂的需求。这就是为什么在[Connecting and Working with MongoDB](https://www.terlici.com/2015/04/03/mongodb-node-express.html)中，我们创建一个分开的文件db.js来帮助我们管理我们的连接。\n它的作用是无论何时我们不用经常键入凭证来很容易地连接数据库。它的第二个目标就是很容易运行测试。\n\n```JavaScript\nvar mysql = require('mysql')\n  , async = require('async')\n\nvar PRODUCTION_DB = 'app_prod_database'\n  , TEST_DB = 'app_test_database'\n\nexports.MODE_TEST = 'mode_test'\nexports.MODE_PRODUCTION = 'mode_production'\n\nvar state = {\n  pool: null,\n  mode: null,\n}\n\nexports.connect = function(mode, done) {\n  state.pool = mysql.createPool({\n    host: 'localhost',\n    user: 'your_user',\n    password: 'some_secret',\n    database: mode === exports.MODE_PRODUCTION ? PRODUCTION_DB : TEST_DB\n  })\n\n  state.mode = mode\n  done()\n}\n\nexports.get = function() {\n  return state.pool\n}\n\nexports.fixtures = function(data) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  var names = Object.keys(data.tables)\n  async.each(names, function(name, cb) {\n    async.each(data.tables[name], function(row, cb) {\n      var keys = Object.keys(row)\n        , values = keys.map(function(key) { return \"'\" + row[key] + \"'\" })\n\n      pool.query('INSERT INTO ' + name + ' (' + keys.join(',') + ') VALUES (' + values.join(',') + ')', cb)\n    }, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n\nexports.drop = function(tables, done) {\n  var pool = state.pool\n  if (!pool) return done(new Error('Missing database connection.'))\n\n  async.each(tables, function(name, cb) {\n    pool.query('DELETE * FROM ' + name, cb)\n  }, done)\n}\n```\n这个db.js有点儿比我们之前的要复杂的多。\n\n首先，它提供一种方法去连接数据库。在生产模块和测试模块都能\n去连接。测试模块仅在自动化测试时运行。\n\n然后，有一个`get`方法能够一直提供给你有效的连接，也可以用来查询数据库。而且，你可以去设置密码，其他模块也可以调用这个方法。\n\n最后，有两个方法`fixtures`和`drop`，很容易地去退出测试。\n\n**drop** 清空数据，它将会帮助你的测试数据库在测试之前总是空的。\n\n**fixtures** 使用json对象，加载数据库中的数据，看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar data = {\n  tables: {\n    people: [\n     {id: 1, name: \"John\", age: 32},\n     {id: 2, name: \"Peter\", age: 29},\n    ],\n    cars: [\n      {id: 1, brand: \"Jeep\", model: \"Cherokee\", owner_id: 2},\n      {id: 2, brand: \"BMW\", model: \"X5\", owner_id: 2},\n      {id: 3, brand: \"Volkswagen\", model: \"Polo\", owner_id: 1},\n    ],\n  },\n}\n\nvar db = require('./db')\ndb.connect(db.MODE_PRODUCTION, function() {\n  db.fixtures(data, function(err) {\n    if (err) return console.log(err)\n    console.log('Data has been loaded...')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n## 使用SQL搭建模块\n\n所有事情准备好了，接下来看看如何在你的应用中使用db.js。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\ncontrollers/\n  comments.js\n  users.js\nmodels/\n  comment.js\n  user.js\nviews/\napp.js\ndb.js\npackage.json\n```\n**app.js** 是应用的入口，也是我们将要设置数据库连接的地方。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('./db')\n\napp.use('/comments', require('./controllers/comments'))\napp.use('/users', require('./controllers/users'))\n\n// Connect to MySQL on start\ndb.connect(db.MODE_PRODUCTION, function(err) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.log('Unable to connect to MySQL.')\n    process.exit(1)\n  } else {\n    app.listen(3000, function() {\n      console.log('Listening on port 3000...')\n    })\n  }\n})\n```\n你的应用将会通过这个模块来与数据库交互。来看一个例子：\n```JavaScript\nvar db = require('../db.js')\n\nexports.create = function(userId, text, done) {\n  var values = [userId, text, new Date().toISOString()]\n\n

= function(done) {\n  db.get().query('SELECT * FROM comments', function (err, rows) {\n    if (err) return done(err)\n    done(null, rows)\n  })\n}\n\nexports.getAllByUser = function(userId, done) {\n

L出现的新控件RecyclerView，把学习的过程都贴出来，便于日后查询。\n\n![Android L](http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160416104439646)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nRecyclerView提供了四种配置：\n> - RecyclerView.LayoutManager\n> - RecyclerView.Adapter< VH extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder >\n> - RecyclerView.ItemDecoration\n> - RecyclerView.ItemAnimator\n\n##  **RecyclerView.LayoutManager**\n一共有三种布局，分别是：\n> - GridLayoutManager      网格布局\n> - LinearLayoutManager   线性布局\n> - StaggeredGridLayoutManager     瀑布流布局\n\n##  **RecyclerView.ItemDecoration**\n可以绘制特殊的RecyclerView的视图，放一篇参考文章<http://blog.csdn.net/lmj623565791/article/details/45059587>\n\n## **RecyclerView.ItemAnimator**\n动画效果，可以指定RecyclerView在添加删除Item时的动画效果。同样，放一篇参考效果\n<https://github.com/wasabeef/recyclerview-animators>\n\n## **RecyclerView.Adapter< VH extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder >**\nRecyclerView的Adapter相比较listview的adapter，强制把ViewHolder分离了出来，有几个方法需要重写：\n```java\npublic class RecyclerViewAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerViewAdapter.ViewHolder> {\n    private Context context;\n    private List<String> list;\n\n    public RankRecyclerViewAdpter(Context context, List<String> list) {\n        this.context = context;\n        this.list = list;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public RecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        View v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_layout, parent, false);\n        return new ViewHolder(v);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder, int position) {\n        viewHolder.textView.setText(list.get(position));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        return list.size();\n    }\n\n    public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\n        public TextView textView;\n        public ViewHolder(View View) {\n            super(view);\n            textView= (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.textView);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n有几个问题需要注意：\n> - layout中放的应该是`android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView` 不然会报错。\n> - `getItemCount()` 的返回值不能为空，不然不会执行`onBindViewHolder`\n> - RecyclerView必须指定LayoutManger，不然同样会报错。\n\n## **RecyclerView的点击事件**\n官方文档中并没有给我们类似ListView的`OnItemClickListener`回调方法，由于RecyclerView比ListView更高级，所以它并没有行或者列的概念，子View可以任意布局，每个子View处理自己的onClick事件，也就是说在Adapter中给子view的rootview设置点击回调。我们今天所要实现的是另外一种方式，类似ListView的`OnItemClickListener`的方式。通过文档我们知道RecyclerView留给开发者一个`RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener`接口，我们要做的就是实现它，实现点击的回调和长按回调。当然了，这种方式只是一个开始，我们还可以拓展为各种复杂的手势操作的回调。\n参考自：<http://blog.csdn.net/hlglinglong/article/details/44981889>\n```java\npublic class RecyclerItemClickListener implements RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener{  \n    private View childView;  \n    private RecyclerView touchView;  \n    public RecyclerItemClickListener(Context context, final OnItemClickListener mListener) {  \n        mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(context, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener(){  \n            @Override  \n            public boolean onSingleTapUp(MotionEvent ev) {  \n                if (childView != null && mListener != null) {  \n                    mListener.onItemClick(childView, touchView.getChildPosition(childView));  \n                }  \n                return true;  \n            }  \n            @Override  \n            public void onLongPress(MotionEvent ev) {  \n                if (childView != null && mListener != null) {  \n                    mListener.onLongClick(childView, touchView.getChildPosition(childView));  \n                }  \n            }  \n        });  \n    }  \n\n    GestureDetector mGestureDetector;  \n\n    public interface OnItemClickListener {  \n        public void onItemClick(View view, int position);  \n        public void onLongClick(View view, int posotion);  \n    }  \n\n    @Override  \n    public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(RecyclerView recyclerView, MotionEvent motionEvent) {  \n        mGestureDetector.onTouchEvent(motionEvent);  \n        childView = recyclerView.findChildViewUnder(motionEvent.getX(), motionEvent.getY());  \n        touchView = recyclerView;  \n        return false;  \n    }  \n\n    @Override  \n    public void onTouchEvent(RecyclerView recyclerView, MotionEvent motionEvent) {  \n\n    }  \n}\n```\n\n## **类似listview的`addHeaderView`和`addFooterView`**\n\nRecyclerView同样没有提供类似listview的`addHeaderView`和`addFooterView` 方法，不过我们可以自定义，参考文章：\n<https://github.com/dingdingyr/HeaderAndFooterRecyclerView->\n原理就是：\n```java\n\t\tGridLayoutManager manager = new GridLayoutManager(this, 2);\n        manager.setSpanSizeLookup(new GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup() {\n            @Override\n            public int getSpanSize(int position) {\n                return adapter.getItemViewType()? manager.getSpanCount() : 1;\n            }\n        });\n```\nGirdLayout可以设置显示的行数，我们可以根据我们要显示的Item类型来指定这个值。\n\n**还有一个问题，那就是在更新apdater的时候不推荐使用`notifyDataSetChanged()` ，因为`notifyDataSetChanged()` 会强制刷新整个视图，如果插入新的数据可以使用 `public final void notifyItemRangeInserted(int positionStart, int itemCount);`。**\n","source":"_posts/recyclerview.md","raw":"---\ntitle: RecyclerView\ndate: 2016-04-20 21:13:42\ntags: Android\ncomments:

**RecyclerView.ItemDecoration**\n可以绘制特殊的RecyclerView的视图，放一篇参考文章<http://blog.csdn.net/lmj623565791/article/details/45059587>\n\n## **RecyclerView.ItemAnimator**\n动画效果，可以指定RecyclerView在添加删除Item时的动画效果。同样，放一篇参考效果\n<https://github.com/wasabeef/recyclerview-animators>\n\n## **RecyclerView.Adapter< VH extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder >**\nRecyclerView的Adapter相比较listview的adapter，强制把ViewHolder分离了出来，有几个方法需要重写：\n```java\npublic class RecyclerViewAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<RecyclerViewAdapter.ViewHolder> {\n    private Context context;\n    private List<String> list;\n\n    public RankRecyclerViewAdpter(Context context, List<String> list) {\n        this.context = context;\n        this.list = list;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public RecyclerView.ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {\n        View v = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.item_layout, parent, false);\n        return new ViewHolder(v);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder viewHolder, int position) {\n        viewHolder.textView.setText(list.get(position));\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int getItemCount() {\n        return list.size();\n    }\n\n    public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {\n        public TextView textView;\n        public ViewHolder(View View) {\n            super(view);\n            textView= (TextView) itemView.findViewById(R.id.textView);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n有几个问题需要注意：\n> - layout中放的应该是`android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView` 不然会报错。\n> - `getItemCount()` 的返回值不能为空，不然不会执行`onBindViewHolder`\n> - RecyclerView必须指定LayoutManger，不然同样会报错。\n\n## **RecyclerView的点击事件**\n官方文档中并没有给我们类似ListView的`OnItemClickListener`回调方法，由于RecyclerView比ListView更高级，所以它并没有行或者列的概念，子View可以任意布局，每个子View处理自己的onClick事件，也就是说在Adapter中给子view的rootview设置点击回调。我们今天所要实现的是另外一种方式，类似ListView的`OnItemClickListener`的方式。通过文档我们知道RecyclerView留给开发者一个`RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener`接口，我们要做的就是实现它，实现点击的回调和长按回调。当然了，这种方式只是一个开始，我们还可以拓展为各种复杂的手势操作的回调。\n参考自：<http://blog.csdn.net/hlglinglong/article/details/44981889>\n```java\npublic class RecyclerItemClickListener implements RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener{  \n    private View childView;  \n    private RecyclerView touchView;  \n    public RecyclerItemClickListener(Context context, final OnItemClickListener mListener) {  \n        mGestureDetector = new GestureDetector(context, new GestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListener(){  \n            @Override  \n            public boolean onSingleTapUp(MotionEvent ev) {  \n                if (childView != null && mListener != null) {  \n                    mListener.onItemClick(childView, touchView.getChildPosition(childView));  \n                }  \n                return true;  \n            }  \n            @Override  \n            public void onLongPress(MotionEvent ev) {  \n                if (childView != null && mListener != null) {  \n                    mListener.onLongClick(childView, touchView.getChildPosition(childView));  \n                }  \n            }  \n        });  \n    }  \n\n    GestureDetector mGestureDetector;  \n\n    public interface OnItemClickListener {  \n        public void onItemClick(View view, int position);  \n        public void onLongClick(View view, int posotion);  \n    }  \n\n    @Override  \n    public boolean onInterceptTouchEvent(RecyclerView recyclerView, MotionEvent motionEvent) {  \n        mGestureDetector.onTouchEvent(motionEvent);  \n        childView = recyclerView.findChildViewUnder(motionEvent.getX(), motionEvent.getY());  \n        touchView = recyclerView;  \n        return false;  \n    }  \n\n    @Override  \n    public void onTouchEvent(RecyclerView recyclerView, MotionEvent motionEvent) {  \n\n    }  \n}\n```\n\n## **类似listview的`addHeaderView`和`addFooterView`**\n\nRecyclerView同样没有提供类似listview的`addHeaderView`和`addFooterView` 方法，不过我们可以自定义，参考文章：\n<https://github.com/dingdingyr/HeaderAndFooterRecyclerView->\n原理就是：\n```java\n\t\tGridLayoutManager manager = new GridLayoutManager(this, 2);\n        manager.setSpanSizeLookup(new GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup() {\n            @Override\n            public int getSpanSize(int position) {\n                return adapter.getItemViewType()? manager.getSpanCount() : 1;\n            }\n        });\n```\nGirdLayout可以设置显示的行数，我们可以根据我们要显示的Item类型来指定这个值。\n\n**还有一个问题，那就是在更新apdater的时候不推荐使用`notifyDataSetChanged()` ，因为`notifyDataSetChanged()` 会强制刷新整个视图，如果插入新的数据可以使用 `public final void notifyItemRangeInserted(int positionStart, int itemCount);`。**\n","slug":"recyclerview","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.499Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vkse002tpmnk1askfmhn","content":"<p>最新在项目中使用了Android\nL出现的新控件RecyclerView，把学习的过程都贴出来，便于日后查询。</p>\n<figure>\n<img

-\nRecyclerView必须指定LayoutManger，不然同样会报错。</p>\n<h2\nid=\"recyclerview的点击事件\"><strong>RecyclerView的点击事件</strong></h2>\n<p>官方文档中并没有给我们类似ListView的<code>OnItemClickListener</code>回调方法，由于RecyclerView比ListView更高级，所以它并没有行或者列的概念，子View可以任意布局，每个子View处理自己的onClick事件，也就是说在Adapter中给子view的rootview设置点击回调。我们今天所要实现的是另外一种方式，类似ListView的<code>OnItemClickListener</code>的方式。通过文档我们知道RecyclerView留给开发者一个<code>RecyclerView.OnItemTouchListener</code>接口，我们要做的就是实现它，实现点击的回调和长按回调。当然了，这种方式只是一个开始，我们还可以拓展为各种复杂的手势操作的回调。\n参考自：<a\nhref=\"http://blog.csdn.net/hlglinglong/article/details/44981889\"\nclass=\"uri\">http://blog.csdn.net/hlglinglong/article/details/44981889</a>\n<figure

-->\n```java\n\tRect r = new Rect();\n\tgetWindow().getDecorView().getWindowVisibleDisplayFrame(r);\n\tDisplayMetrics metrics = new DisplayMetrics();\n\tgetWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getMetrics(metrics);\n\t//屏幕的高度，不包含虚拟按键\n\tint screenHeight = metrics.heightPixels;\n\t//屏幕真实的高度，包含虚拟按键\n\tgetWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getRealMetrics(metrics);\n\t//虚拟按键的高度\n\tint virtualHight = metrics.heightPixels - screenHeight;\n\tint statusBarHeight=getStatusBarHeight(context);\n\t// 在不显示软键盘时，heightDiff等于状态栏的高度\n\t// 在显示软键盘时，heightDiff会变大，等于软键盘加状态栏的高度。\n\t// 所以heightDiff大于状态栏高度时表示软键盘出现了，\n\t// 这时可算出软键盘的高度，即heightDiff减去状态栏的高度\n\tif (heightDiff > statusBarHeight) {\n\t\tkeyboardHeight = heightDiff - statusBarHeight;\n\t}\n\n\tif (isShowKeyboard) {\n\t\t// 如果软键盘是弹出的状态，并且heightDiff小于等于状态栏高度，\n\t\tif (heightDiff <= statusBarHeight) {\n\t\t\t// 说明这时软键盘已经收起\n\t\t\tisShowKeyboard=false;\n\t\t}\n\t} else {\n        // 如果软键盘是收起的状态，并且heightDiff大于状态栏高度，\n        if (heightDiff > statusBarHeight) {\n         // 说明这时软键盘已经弹出\n         isShowKeyboard=true;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\n有一个 **ViewTreeObserver** 的类，可以用来监听view状态的变化，包括焦点改变、开始绘制、触摸事件等等的变化，如果要想控制某个控件的高度，可以利用这个类来实现，如下所示：\n```java\n\tview.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {\n\t\t\t /**\n\t         * Callback method to be invoked when the global layout state or the visibility of views\n\t         * within the view tree changes\n\t         */\n            @Override\n            public void onGlobalLayout() {\n                //这里放你要实现的效果。\n            }\n        });\n```\n下面是获取手机状态栏高度的办法\n```java\n\t// 获取手机状态栏高度\n    public static int getStatusBarHeight(Context context) {\n        Class<?> c = null;\n        Object obj = null;\n        Field field = null;\n        int x = 0, statusBarHeight = 0;\n        try {\n            c = Class.forName(\"com.android.internal.R$dimen\");\n            obj = c.newInstance();\n            field = c.getField(\"status_bar_height\");\n            x=Integer.parseInt(field.get(obj).toString());\n            statusBarHeight =

获取软键盘高度和生成9-patch\ndate: 2016-08-24 23:30:49\ntags: Android\ncomments: false\n---\n最近在做一个类似聊天的功能，所以需要获取到软键盘的高度来控制界面的显示，同时有一些手机上面有虚拟按键，在界面布局的时候需要注意。下面的代码就是一段获取手机软键盘高度的办法。\n<!-- more -->\n```java\n\tRect r = new Rect();\n\tgetWindow().getDecorView().getWindowVisibleDisplayFrame(r);\n\tDisplayMetrics metrics = new DisplayMetrics();\n\tgetWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getMetrics(metrics);\n\t//屏幕的高度，不包含虚拟按键\n\tint screenHeight = metrics.heightPixels;\n\t//屏幕真实的高度，包含虚拟按键\n\tgetWindowManager().getDefaultDisplay().getRealMetrics(metrics);\n\t//虚拟按键的高度\n\tint virtualHight = metrics.heightPixels - screenHeight;\n\tint statusBarHeight=getStatusBarHeight(context);\n\t// 在不显示软键盘时，heightDiff等于状态栏的高度\n\t// 在显示软键盘时，heightDiff会变大，等于软键盘加状态栏的高度。\n\t// 所以heightDiff大于状态栏高度时表示软键盘出现了，\n\t// 这时可算出软键盘的高度，即heightDiff减去状态栏的高度\n\tif (heightDiff > statusBarHeight) {\n\t\tkeyboardHeight = heightDiff - statusBarHeight;\n\t}\n\n\tif (isShowKeyboard) {\n\t\t// 如果软键盘是弹出的状态，并且heightDiff小于等于状态栏高度，\n\t\tif (heightDiff <= statusBarHeight) {\n\t\t\t// 说明这时软键盘已经收起\n\t\t\tisShowKeyboard=false;\n\t\t}\n\t} else {\n        // 如果软键盘是收起的状态，并且heightDiff大于状态栏高度，\n        if (heightDiff > statusBarHeight) {\n         // 说明这时软键盘已经弹出\n         isShowKeyboard=true;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\n有一个 **ViewTreeObserver** 的类，可以用来监听view状态的变化，包括焦点改变、开始绘制、触摸事件等等的变化，如果要想控制某个控件的高度，可以利用这个类来实现，如下所示：\n```java\n\tview.getViewTreeObserver().addOnGlobalLayoutListener(new ViewTreeObserver.OnGlobalLayoutListener() {\n\t\t\t /**\n\t         * Callback method to be invoked when the global layout state or the visibility of views\n\t         * within the view tree changes\n\t         */\n            @Override\n            public void onGlobalLayout() {\n                //这里放你要实现的效果。\n            }\n        });\n```\n下面是获取手机状态栏高度的办法\n```java\n\t// 获取手机状态栏高度\n    public static int getStatusBarHeight(Context context) {\n        Class<?> c = null;\n        Object obj = null;\n        Field field = null;\n        int x = 0, statusBarHeight = 0;\n        try {\n            c = Class.forName(\"com.android.internal.R$dimen\");\n            obj = c.newInstance();\n            field = c.getField(\"status_bar_height\");\n            x=Integer.parseInt(field.get(obj).toString());\n            statusBarHeight = context.getResources().getDimensionPixelSize(x);\n        } catch (Exception e1) {\n            e1.printStackTrace();\n        }\n        return statusBarHeight;\n

src=\"http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160824174835941\"\nalt=\"xx.9.png\" /></p>\n<p>在<code>\\sdk\\tools\\</code> 下面有 <strong>draw9patch</strong>\n命令，如果你配置了路径了，可以直接在命令行使用<strong>draw9patch</strong>打开。至于如何配置路径，这里就不赘述了。打开之后导入图片就能生成\n<strong>9-Patch</strong> ，如下图： <img\nsrc=\"http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160824204210485\" alt=\"draw9patch\" /></p>\n<p>下面就是最终效果了，需要注意的是，生成的 <strong>xx.9.png</strong>\n文件需保存在 <strong>drawable</strong>\n的目录下面，然后就可以直接调用了。\n在工具上，有边线可以直接拖动，多试验几次找到最合适自己的，如图所示黑色阴影是要显示的区域的边距，两条绿色区域的交叉处就是最后会被拉伸的地方，右边就是最后被拉伸的效果图。\n<img src=\"http://img.blog.csdn.net/20160824174900410\" alt=\"效果\"

首辅申时行\n他的老成来自长期处理各种人事经验；这种经验，使他深知我们这个帝国有一个特点：一项政策能否付诸实施，实施后或成或败，全靠看它与所有文官的共同习惯是否相安无扰，否则理论上的完美，仍不过是空中楼阁。这一帝国既无崇尚武功的趋向，也没有改造社会、提高生活程度的宏愿；它的宗旨，只是在于使大批人民不为饥荒所窘迫，即在“四书”所谓“黎民不饥不寒”的低标准下以维持长治久安。这种宗旨如何推行？直接与农民合作是不可能的，他们是被统治者，不读书，不明理，缺乏共同的语言。和各地绅士合作，也不会收到很大的效果，因为他们的分布地区过广，局部利害不同，即使用文字为联系的工具，其接触也极为有限。剩下唯一可行的就是与全体文官的合作，如果没有取得他们的同意，办任何事情都将此路不通。\n\n2. 因之我们的政事，注重体制的安定，而不计较对一人一事的绝对公允。牺牲少数人，正是维持大局的办法。\n\n3. 讪君卖直\n\n4. 有些文官熟读诗书，深知百世流芳之说，他们可以找到一个题目，宁可在御前犯不敬之罪，今日受刑，明日名扬史册。这样的做法，说明了忠臣烈士的名誉，确乎是一种高贵的商品。否则，何以有许多人愿意付出这样昂贵的代价，放弃经过千辛万苦挣来的仕途，继之以血肉甚至生命去追求？\n\n5. 离开了权术，这些高级官员也无精明能干之可言，而权术又总是和诚信背道而驰的。46\n\n6. “如入火聚，得清凉门。”\n\n7. 表面看来，所有处分出自皇帝的旨意，其实所有案件，无一不产生于文官集团中的矛盾。首辅或是在政策上遭到多数人的反对，或是个性太强而引起嫉妒和仇视。技术上的争端，一经发展，就可以升级扩大而成道德问题，胜利者及失败者也就相应地被认为至善或极恶。\n\n8. 第三章 世间已无张居正\n表面上的宁静通常是虚幻的。文官集团缺乏应有的和衷共济，反而集中了无数的利害冲突，形成了一个带有爆炸性的团体。在万历皇帝御宇的四十八年中，特别到了后期，大臣们已经看透了中枢无复具有领导全局的能力，也就不得不以消极敷衍的态度来应付局面。此类态度类似疫气，很快就在文官中流传，使忠于职守者缺乏信心，贪污腐败者更加有机可乘。这种不景气的趋势愈演愈烈，使整个王朝走到了崩溃的边缘。其所以能勉强维持，实在是因为替代的办法尚未找到。而像我们这样庞大而历史悠久的帝国，即使在不利的条件之下，仅凭惯性也可以使这个王朝继续存在若干年月\n\n9. 身为天子的万历，在另一种意义上讲，他不过是紫禁城中的一名囚徒。他的权力大多带有被动性。25他可以把他不喜欢的官员革职查办，但是很难升迁拔擢他所喜欢的官员，以致没有一个人足以成为他的心腹。他对大臣们的奏折作出决断，可以超出法律的规定，但是他没有制定法律的力量。官僚之间发生冲突，理所当然地由他加以裁夺，但是他不能改造制度以避免冲突的发生，而且他裁夺的权威性正在日益微弱，因为他被臣下视为燕安怠惰。各边区的军事问题必须奏报皇帝，但是皇帝自己不能统率兵将，在平日也没有整顿军备的可能。他很难跨出宫门一步，自然更谈不上离开京城巡视各省。连这一点选择的自由都没有，居于九五之尊还有什么趣味？\n\n10. 万历皇帝缺乏他叔祖的勇气、积极性和寻找快乐的情趣。他从小开始就没有一天体会到自由的意义，也不是凭借自己的能力而获得臣下的尊敬，所以就难怪乎他不能向臣下提出明确的主张了。他读过有关他叔祖的记录，深知文臣集团只要意见一致，就是一种很强大的力量。既然缺乏坚强的毅力，这个孤立无援的皇帝只好一再向臣下屈服。然而他又不是一个胸襟开阔足以容物、并以恕道待人的皇帝，他的自尊心受到损伤，他就设法报复。报复的目的不是在于恢复皇帝的权威，而纯系发泄。发泄的对象也不一定是冒犯他的人，而是无辜的第三者。积多年之经验，他发现了最有效的武器乃是消极抵抗，即老子所谓“无为”。50\n\n11. 第四章 活着的祖宗\n于是这位酋长今后得以为所欲为，而且还能够继续利用本朝内外官员的不和来发展他自己的千秋大业。此是后话，也不在本书叙述范围之内。这位酋长并非别人，据当日记录称，他名叫奴尔哈赤。若干年之后，他的庙号则为清太祖。\n\n12. 由于成宪的不可更改，一个年轻皇帝没有能把自己的创造能力在政治生活中充分使用，他的个性也无从发挥，反而被半信半疑地引导进这乌有之乡，充当了活着的祖宗。\n\n13. 第五章 海瑞——古怪的模范官僚\n恰恰暴露了我们这个帝国在制度上长期存在的困难：以熟读诗书的文人治理农民，他们不可能改进这个司法制度，更谈不上保障人权。法律的解释和执行离不开传统的伦理，组织上也没有对付复杂因素和多元关系的能力。\n\n14. 洪武皇帝所推行的农村政策及一整套的措施，对本朝今后的历史，影响至为深远。其最显著的后果是，在全国的广大农村中遏止了法制的成长发育，而以抽象的道德取代了法律。上自官僚下至村民，其判断是非的标准是“善”和“恶”，而不是“合法”或“非法”。\n\n15. 我们的帝国缺乏有效的货币制度和商业法律。\n\n16. 本朝法律的重点在于对农民的治理，是以很少有涉及商业的条文。\n\n17. 财产所有权的维护和遵守契约的义务，不能在大量商业中彻底维持，却最有效地体现于农村中的租佃及抵押上。\n\n18. 为耆老士绅所不能解决而必须由官方处置的，绝大多数为刑事案件。判决这类案件，政府的态度常常坚定而明确，如果发生人命损失，则尤其不能有丝毫的玩忽，一定要求水落石出。“杀人者死”这一古老的立法原则在当时仍被沿用，过失杀人和谋杀之间区别极微。\n\n19. 可见我们帝国的政治措施至此已和立法精神脱节，道德伦理是道德伦理，做事时则另有妙法。再要在阴阳之间找出一个折衷之点而为公众所接受，也就越来越困难了。\n\n20. 第六章 戚继光——孤独的将领\n当社会和经济的发展不能平衡，冲突激化，以政治手段调剂无效，通常就会导致战争。\n\n21. 他在军区中建造的私宅命名为“止止堂”，132运用《庄子》中“虚室生白，吉祥止止”的典故，表示他谦抑自持，愿意在虚静之间得到\n\n22. 戚继光的长处，在于他没有把这些人事上的才能当成投机取巧和升官发财的本钱，而只是作为建立新军和保卫国家的手段。他深知一个将领只能在社会情况的允许之下才能使军事科学和军事技术在现实生活里发挥作用。他接受这样的现实，以尽其在我的精神把事情办好，同时也在可能的情况下使自己得到适当的享受。至于合法或者不合法，从他的政治的眼光看来已无关宏旨。\n\n23. 第七章 李贽——自相冲突的哲学家\n，最后终于悟出一个道理，即宇宙间各种事物的“有”，完全出于个人心理上的反映，比如花开花落，如果不被人所看见，花就与心“同归于寂”。所谓天理，就是先天存在于各人心中的、最高尚的原则。忠孝是天理，也是心中自然而然产生的观念。\n\n24. 王阳明并没有为真理而真理的倾向。和朱熹一样，他的目的也在于利用他的思想系统，去证实他从小接受的儒家教条，以求经世致用。\n\n25. 张居正在政治上找不到出路，其情形类似于李贽在哲学上找不到出路。创造一种哲学思想比较容易，因为它是哲学家个人意识活动的产物。但是宣布一种政治思想，以之作为治国的原则，其后果则为立竿见影，它必须在技术上符合现状，才能推行无碍。在本朝的社会中，儒家的仁，类似于宪法的理论基础。全国的读书人相信性善，则他们首先就应该抑制个人的欲望，不去强调个人的权利。扩而大之，他们一旦位列封疆或者职居显要，也就不能强调本地区、本部门的特权。例如东南各省本来可以由海外贸易而获大利，但由于顾全大体，没有坚持这种特别的经济利益，就得以保持全国政治的均衡。在这种以公众利益为前提的条件下，政府中枢才有可能统一管理全国，而无须考虑各地区、各部门以及各个人的特殊需要。这是一种笼统的办法，也是一种技术上简陋和没有出息的办法。\n\n26. 如果本朝的统治者感到了此路不通，企图改弦易辙，则必然会导致社会成员以自私自利为目的，天赋人权的学说又必然如影随形地兴起，整个社会就将遭到根本性的冲击。但是这种局面，在欧洲的小国里，也要在几百年之后，等市民阶级的力量成熟，才会出现，张居正和李贽正不必为此而焦虑。事实上，他们也不可能看得如此长远，他们企盼的自由，只是优秀分子或者是杰出的大政治家不受习俗限制的自由。\n\n27. 马基雅弗利，\n\n28. 在历史上默默无闻，在自身则可以省却了多少苦恼。\n\n29. 当一个人口众多的国家，各人行动全凭儒家简单粗浅而又无法固定的原则所限制，而法律又缺乏创造性，则其社会发展的程度，必然受到限制。即便是宗旨善良，也不能补助技术之不及。1587年，是为万历十五年，岁次丁亥，表面上似乎是四海升平，无事可记，实际上我们的大明帝国却已经走到了它发展的尽头。在这个时候，皇帝的励精图治或者宴安耽乐，首辅的独裁或者调和，高级将领的富于创造或者习于苟安，文官的廉洁奉公或者贪污舞弊，思想家的极端进步或者绝对保守，最后的结果，都是无分善恶，统统不能在事业上取得有意义的发展，有的身败，有的名裂，还有的人则身败而兼名裂。\n\n30. 因此我们的故事只好在这里作悲剧性的结束。万历丁亥年的年鉴，是为历史上一部失败的总记录。\n\n31. 《万历十五年》和我的大历史观\n我这几十年在海外得到的一个重要经验，则是西方文化有一个重要长处，即是在犹太教及基督教传统里面承认人类有经常做错事的根源，其称为original sin，也不能说它就是“性恶论”，和儒家的“性善说”相反。孔子说：“观过，斯知仁矣。”孟子说：“羞恶之心，人皆有之。”也都是不待外间逼迫，自己承认过失。有这种认错的精神，也就表示人类有向善的趋向。这中外共通之点，我觉得今日很可以做广义道德观念的基础，也可以做世界历史的中心思想。狭义的道德观念基于狭义的宇宙观，就是武断地说出世界的根源如是，它的结局也必如是。这往往明为真理，实际带有自私的见解，并且预先摆下了一个蛮不认错的想法，极容易走极端，可以以希特勒的人种学说窥见之。\n\n32. 我们也还不能够知道宇宙结构的真原因和真目的，也很难预知今后的真结局与真趋势。\n\n33. 万历：漫长的怠政时代\n管理我们这个庞大帝国的秘诀是不能依靠法律或权力去管制和惩罚，而是劝导人们，青年人要尊敬老年人，女人要服从男人，文盲要追随读书识字的人。在这些方面，官员们的表率作用就极其重要。\n\n","source":"_posts/《万历十五年》摘抄.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

海瑞——古怪的模范官僚\n恰恰暴露了我们这个帝国在制度上长期存在的困难：以熟读诗书的文人治理农民，他们不可能改进这个司法制度，更谈不上保障人权。法律的解释和执行离不开传统的伦理，组织上也没有对付复杂因素和多元关系的能力。</p></li>\n<li><p>洪武皇帝所推行的农村政策及一整套的措施，对本朝今后的历史，影响至为深远。其最显著的后果是，在全国的广大农村中遏止了法制的成长发育，而以抽象的道德取代了法律。上自官僚下至村民，其判断是非的标准是“善”和“恶”，而不是“合法”或“非法”。</p></li>\n<li><p>我们的帝国缺乏有效的货币制度和商业法律。</p></li>\n<li><p>本朝法律的重点在于对农民的治理，是以很少有涉及商业的条文。</p></li>\n<li><p>财产所有权的维护和遵守契约的义务，不能在大量商业中彻底维持，却最有效地体现于农村中的租佃及抵押上。</p></li>\n<li><p>为耆老士绅所不能解决而必须由官方处置的，绝大多数为刑事案件。判决这类案件，政府的态度常常坚定而明确，如果发生人命损失，则尤其不能有丝毫的玩忽，一定要求水落石出。“杀人者死”这一古老的立法原则在当时仍被沿用，过失杀人和谋杀之间区别极微。</p></li>\n<li><p>可见我们帝国的政治措施至此已和立法精神脱节，道德伦理是道德伦理，做事时则另有妙法。再要在阴阳之间找出一个折衷之点而为公众所接受，也就越来越困难了。</p></li>\n<li><p>第六章 戚继光——孤独的将领\n当社会和经济的发展不能平衡，冲突激化，以政治手段调剂无效，通常就会导致战争。</p></li>\n<li><p>他在军区中建造的私宅命名为“止止堂”，132运用《庄子》中“虚室生白，吉祥止止”的典故，表示他谦抑自持，愿意在虚静之间得到</p></li>\n<li><p>戚继光的长处，在于他没有把这些人事上的才能当成投机取巧和升官发财的本钱，而只是作为建立新军和保卫国家的手段。他深知一个将领只能在社会情况的允许之下才能使军事科学和军事技术在现实生活里发挥作用。他接受这样的现实，以尽其在我的精神把事情办好，同时也在可能的情况下使自己得到适当的享受。至于合法或者不合法，从他的政治的眼光看来已无关宏旨。</p></li>\n<li><p>第七章 李贽——自相冲突的哲学家\n，最后终于悟出一个道理，即宇宙间各种事物的“有”，完全出于个人心理上的反映，比如花开花落，如果不被人所看见，花就与心“同归于寂”。所谓天理，就是先天存在于各人心中的、最高尚的原则。忠孝是天理，也是心中自然而然产生的观念。</p></li>\n<li><p>王阳明并没有为真理而真理的倾向。和朱熹一样，他的目的也在于利用他的思想系统，去证实他从小接受的儒家教条，以求经世致用。</p></li>\n<li><p>张居正在政治上找不到出路，其情形类似于李贽在哲学上找不到出路。创造一种哲学思想比较容易，因为它是哲学家个人意识活动的产物。但是宣布一种政治思想，以之作为治国的原则，其后果则为立竿见影，它必须在技术上符合现状，才能推行无碍。在本朝的社会中，儒家的仁，类似于宪法的理论基础。全国的读书人相信性善，则他们首先就应该抑制个人的欲望，不去强调个人的权利。扩而大之，他们一旦位列封疆或者职居显要，也就不能强调本地区、本部门的特权。例如东南各省本来可以由海外贸易而获大利，但由于顾全大体，没有坚持这种特别的经济利益，就得以保持全国政治的均衡。在这种以公众利益为前提的条件下，政府中枢才有可能统一管理全国，而无须考虑各地区、各部门以及各个人的特殊需要。这是一种笼统的办法，也是一种技术上简陋和没有出息的办法。</p></li>\n<li><p>如果本朝的统治者感到了此路不通，企图改弦易辙，则必然会导致社会成员以自私自利为目的，天赋人权的学说又必然如影随形地兴起，整个社会就将遭到根本性的冲击。但是这种局面，在欧洲的小国里，也要在几百年之后，等市民阶级的力量成熟，才会出现，张居正和李贽正不必为此而焦虑。事实上，他们也不可能看得如此长远，他们企盼的自由，只是优秀分子或者是杰出的大政治家不受习俗限制的自由。</p></li>\n<li><p>马基雅弗利，</p></li>\n<li><p>在历史上默默无闻，在自身则可以省却了多少苦恼。</p></li>\n<li><p>当一个人口众多的国家，各人行动全凭儒家简单粗浅而又无法固定的原则所限制，而法律又缺乏创造性，则其社会发展的程度，必然受到限制。即便是宗旨善良，也不能补助技术之不及。1587年，是为万历十五年，岁次丁亥，表面上似乎是四海升平，无事可记，实际上我们的大明帝国却已经走到了它发展的尽头。在这个时候，皇帝的励精图治或者宴安耽乐，首辅的独裁或者调和，高级将领的富于创造或者习于苟安，文官的廉洁奉公或者贪污舞弊，思想家的极端进步或者绝对保守，最后的结果，都是无分善恶，统统不能在事业上取得有意义的发展，有的身败，有的名裂，还有的人则身败而兼名裂。</p></li>\n<li><p>因此我们的故事只好在这里作悲剧性的结束。万历丁亥年的年鉴，是为历史上一部失败的总记录。</p></li>\n<li><p>《万历十五年》和我的大历史观\n我这几十年在海外得到的一个重要经验，则是西方文化有一个重要长处，即是在犹太教及基督教传统里面承认人类有经常做错事的根源，其称为original\nsin，也不能说它就是“性恶论”，和儒家的“性善说”相反。孔子说：“观过，斯知仁矣。”孟子说：“羞恶之心，人皆有之。”也都是不待外间逼迫，自己承认过失。有这种认错的精神，也就表示人类有向善的趋向。这中外共通之点，我觉得今日很可以做广义道德观念的基础，也可以做世界历史的中心思想。狭义的道德观念基于狭义的宇宙观，就是武断地说出世界的根源如是，它的结局也必如是。这往往明为真理，实际带有自私的见解，并且预先摆下了一个蛮不认错的想法，极容易走极端，可以以希特勒的人种学说窥见之。</p></li>\n<li><p>我们也还不能够知道宇宙结构的真原因和真目的，也很难预知今后的真结局与真趋势。</p></li>\n<li><p>万历：漫长的怠政时代\n管理我们这个庞大帝国的秘诀是不能依靠法律或权力去管制和惩罚，而是劝导人们，青年人要尊敬老年人，女人要服从男人，文盲要追随读书识字的人。在这些方面，官员们的表率作用就极其重要。</p></li>\n</ol>\n","related_posts":[],"length":3674,"excerpt":"<p>《万历十五年（四十周年纪念版）精装》

首辅申时行\n他的老成来自长期处理各种人事经验；这种经验，使他深知我们这个帝国有一个特点：一项政策能否付诸实施，实施后或成或败，全靠看它与所有文官的共同习惯是否相安无扰，否则理论上的完美，仍不过是空中楼阁。这一帝国既无崇尚武功的趋向，也没有改造社会、提高生活程度的宏愿；它的宗旨，只是在于使大批人民不为饥荒所窘迫，即在“四书”所谓“黎民不饥不寒”的低标准下以维持长治久安。这种宗旨如何推行？直接与农民合作是不可能的，他们是被统治者，不读书，不明理，缺乏共同的语言。和各地绅士合作，也不会收到很大的效果，因为他们的分布地区过广，局部利害不同，即使用文字为联系的工具，其接触也极为有限。剩下唯一可行的就是与全体文官的合作，如果没有取得他们的同意，办任何事情都将此路不通。</p></li>\n<li><p>因之我们的政事，注重体制的安定，而不计较对一人一事的绝对公允。牺牲少数人，正是维持大局的办法。</p></li>\n<li><p>讪君卖直</p></li>\n<li><p>有些文官熟读诗书，深知百世流芳之说，他们可以找到一个题目，宁可在御前犯不敬之罪，今日受刑，明日名扬史册。这样的做法，说明了忠臣烈士的名誉，确乎是一种高贵的商品。否则，何以有许多人愿意付出这样昂贵的代价，放弃经过千辛万苦挣来的仕途，继之以血肉甚至生命去追求？</p></li>\n<li><p>离开了权术，这些高级官员也无精明能干之可言，而权术又总是和诚信背道而驰的。46</p></li>\n<li><p>“如入火聚，得清凉门。”</p></li>\n<li><p>表面看来，所有处分出自皇帝的旨意，其实所有案件，无一不产生于文官集团中的矛盾。首辅或是在政策上遭到多数人的反对，或是个性太强而引起嫉妒和仇视。技术上的争端，一经发展，就可以升级扩大而成道德问题，胜利者及失败者也就相应地被认为至善或极恶。</p></li>\n<li><p>第三章

支付结果回调，实现一个``.wxapi.WXPayEntryActivity``(包名或类名不一致会造成无法回调)。如果不需要显示这个，直接finish就好了。\n```xml\n<activity\n           android:name=\".wxapi.WXPayEntryActivity\"\n           android:exported=\"true\"

如果是统一下单的时候有问题，请确认后台返回给你的订单号是否是唯一的，参数是否正确，sign的时候时候按照要求签名，微信平台填的是否是MD5签名，发起请求的方式是否为post，是否传送的是XML数据，如果是使用Retrofit发起请求，可以这样子：\n```java\nnew Retrofit.Builder()\n

思想内在于现实，思想观念并不脱离于社会现实，而是内在于社会现实的。\n<!--more-->\n2. “现代”是一种新的时间意识，意指“当下或此刻”，对当下新颖性的敏感，是指一种新的时间意识，或者说历史观。\n3. 以上时间观带来的变化是。第一，生活不再是循环往复的，而是日新月异的，过去的经验很可能是靠不住的。第二，从“厚古薄今”转向“厚今薄古”，认为当下比过去重要，形成“线性进步的历史观”。第三，对人的创造性和主体性的肯定，使人从循环历史宿命中解放出来。\n4. “现代化”这个术语主要是指现代历史变革的过程，启蒙理性主义是推动变革产生的关键思想因素。“现代化”的结果造就了现代世界，它具有不同于传统社会的许多特征，“现代性”就是用来指称这些特征的术语。\n5. 古今之变，带来的几个变化，第一，个人主观赋予的价值变得极其重要，有时甚至能压倒其他一切标准。第二，人们观念中的自然秩序被理性给打破了。第三，自然的秩序被打破了，我们建立起来了理性的秩序。\n6. 启蒙就是用用理性的光芒打破黑暗，让人摆脱非理性的蒙昧，走向成熟。理性成为区分真理与蒙昧的决定性标准，成了衡量一切的准绳；理性甚至取代了神的位置，具有近乎上帝一般的神圣地位。\n7. 古今之变带来了两个基本观念上转变：一个是“人类中心主义的转变”，它指的是人看待世界的观念发生了变化；另一个是“个人主义的转变”，它是指人看待自己的观念发生了变化，或者说人的“自我理解”的转变。\n8. “个人主义的转向”，人首先是一个独立的个体，可以脱离任何一个群体进入别的去群体。这种转向带来了难以想象的个人自由，但代价就是个人失去了与一个特定群体的久远、厚重和牢固的纽带关系，这带来了孤独感、漂泊感和乡愁。这也是现代性困境的一部分。\n\n# 第一章 现代思想的成年\n1. 韦伯的思想的三个核心命题，“世界的祛魅”、“诸神之争”、“现代的铁笼”，以及一个重要的概念“工具理性”。\n2. “诸神之争”，指人们信奉的价值观。韦伯提出了事实判断和价值判断。事实判断有确定性。价值判断没有一个唯一正确的价值观，这带来了价值多元的问题。\n3. 韦伯提出人类理性包含两种，一是工具理性，二是价值理性。工具理性的计算，就是一种事实判断。价值理性的权衡是一种价值判断。在现代化的过程中，工具理性不断扩张，比如官僚制、绩效制。\n4. 理性化把现代铸造成了一个“铁笼”，人被“非人化”，被看做机器的零件。这样有两个弊端，一是一种片面的社会文化，一是一种片面的社会关系。这种牢笼是一个双刃剑，既是残酷的，也是对现代生活的一种保障。认为打破这个牢笼就能解决我们的问题，无疑是一种天真。\n\n# 第二章 现代人的精神危机\n1. 人在精神层面上总会面对两个根本性的人生难题，一个是死亡，一个是贪欲。也是终极关怀的两大难题。\n2. 克尔凯郭尔发现，你是无法完全依靠逻辑和推理来求证信仰为真、来确证它的可靠性。信仰与理性之间存在这鸿沟，这靠理性论证本身难以弥合，确立信仰在现代世界因为变得非常困难。\n3. 孙周兴老师概括的尼采的三大命题：一是人生虚无；二是理论虚假；三是生命强健。\n4. 尼采认为：面对无意义的世界和无意义的生命，人应该立足于现实，直面无意义的荒谬，以强大的生命本能舞蹈，在生命活动中创造出价值。从消极的虚无主义转向积极虚无主义。\n5. 尼采说，人类的高贵在于自身有决定价值的能力，面对虚无的人生，有两种截然不同的人生选择，奴隶道德和主人道德。\n6. 尼采的哲学充满激进的否定性，甚至对自己也毫不客气。\n7. 尼采提出，客观的事实真相可能根本不存在。“没有事实，只有阐释。”，“视角是所有生活的基本条件。”，也就是视角主义。视角决定事实。\n8. 视角主义教给我们的，不是分裂的必然，而是谦逊的必要。我们应该认识到，我们了解的真相并不是绝对的真相，应该保持倾听、理解和学习的心态去了解它们。\n9. 弗洛伊德提出，在精神意义上，没有人是绝对健康的，正常和不正常之间并不是泾渭分明的。人的精神结构就像一座冰山，人能意识到的只是浮出水面的一小部分，在水面之下还有巨大的一部分，这就是无意识。\n10. 弗洛伊德提出“精神分析学说”，里面一个重要的内容就是，人格三元说。即，本我，自我和超我。\n11. 弗洛伊德的精神分析学说，在心理学界渐渐走向了衰落，但是在思想文化界的影响很大，塑造着我们的精神生活。从此，对于人的理解核心不再是理性而是欲望，至少也是理性和欲望的不断冲突。欲望被看作是不可否认、不可抹杀的生命驱动力。\n12. “可证伪”，就是有可能被经验证据证明是错误的。一个科学理论需要直面不符合理论的事实，直面对自身不利的证据。如果你提出一个科学理论，那么这个理论不能宣称自己永远正确、能够解释所有的经验证据。如果能够解释一切，这就成了伪科学，伪科学就是永远能够自圆其说。\n13. 萨特的思想，有两个重要的概念，一个是自由选择，一个是积极行动。萨特还有一句非常有名的话：“存在就是虚无”。存在是虚无的，人也厌恶虚无，厌恶虚无背后的缺失和不确定性。所以我们总是需要去填满自己的虚无，去获得某种本质。\n14. 萨特提出一对概念来区分物的存在和人的存在。他把物的那种被决定的、不能改变的存在，叫作“自在”的存在。把人的这种“有待形成”的、不固定的存在，叫作“自为”的存在，就是自己“为自己”而存在。自在的存在有一个固定不变的本质；而自为的存在没有固定的本质，它的本质是可以变化的。\n15. 人永远不会“是”什么，而是永远正在“成为”什么。萨特的存在主义哲学，最突出的一个导向，就是呼唤人们面对存在的真相。存在就是虚无，存在先于预先的本质。如果“本质”决定了命运，那么先于本质而存在的人就不被任何命运所限定，也就说，人在根本上是自由的。\n16. 萨特的两个著名观点，第一，自由选择是很沉重的负担；第二，“他人就是地狱”。因为自由选择必定带来后果，你做了选择，就要独自承担这份后果，你所有的选择，依据都是你自己，你就是自己的标准，要为自己的每一个选择承担绝对的责任。从“存在就是虚无”，萨特推出了人的绝对自由；而从绝对的自由，萨特又推出了绝对的责任。\n17. 人能够自由地掌握自己的生命，哲学上把这叫作人的主体性。我是主体，就意味着我有主导权。在萨特看来，人和人的交往，总是在为了争夺主体性而斗争。即使是爱情当中也不例外。我们生活在一个有他人存在的世界，每个人都是自由的，但是我们不可能实现那种理想中的共同自由，因为每个人都要实现自己的主体性，人与人之间只有永恒的斗争。萨特是一个悲观主义者，他不相信自由主义所向往的那种主体和主体之间的相互承认、平等尊重的关系。\n\n# 第三章 20世纪的教训\n1. 政治学有两个基本假设，第一个是“资源匮乏”假设，认为人类生活中所需要的资源总是匮乏的。第二个是“人性自利”假设。\n2. 对于政府和国家的特征，马克思·韦伯提出过一个著名的定义：在特定的领土之内对暴力的合法垄断。\n3. 政治学家霍布斯、卢梭和洛克等提出来了不同版本的“社会契约论”，为现代的政治权威提供依据理由。不同版本的社会契约论之间有很多差异，但都分享了两个基本特征。第一，都主张先存在自然社会，然后才建立政府。也就是说，政府不是天然存在的，而是派生的“人造之物”。第二，都主张“同意理论”，政治权威的统治合法性来自被统治者的同意，是自下而上的，而不是自反的。\n4. 齐格门·鲍曼通过《现代性和大屠杀》来分析现代性和纳粹大屠杀之间的关联性。第一，正是机器般理性的现代官僚制，实现了大屠杀这个非理性的暴行。第二，现代科学主义提供了“园艺文化”来为大屠杀提供理念支持，园艺文化看待社会，认为社会秩序是一项工程，可以在科学理性的指导下整理的干干净净，整齐划一，清晰优美。第三，纳粹对受害者理性计算心理的利用，给受害者提供选项，调整其中的收益，去引导受害者合作。不过，这不是说大屠杀是现代社会的必然，在鲍曼看来，要防范大屠杀这样的灾难，关键在于要坚守一种不可让步的、无条件的道德感，保持对他人的道德感知。简单来说，就是永远别忘了你面前的人是一个人。\n5. 汉娜·阿伦特指出纳粹的动机不是出自人性的自私、贪婪、恐惧、复仇欲望或者施虐欲望，纯粹就是把犹太人看作是多余的东西，要“根除人这个概念本身”。由此提出了“极端之恶”和“平庸之恶”。即，纳粹大屠杀是一种极端的恶，经由一些“平庸”的罪犯犯下执行的。这些罪犯身上的这种“恶的平庸性”，其实质是不去思考，是丧失了思考能力。\n6. 汉娜·阿伦特主张，传统的道德法则和教化已经不能促成真正的道德思考了。道德的真正含义不是循规蹈矩，而是要做出自己独立的是非对错。要保持独立判断，反对盲从。道德思考没有通则可循，独立的道德判断是艰巨的任务。苏格拉底说过“宁可自己遭受冤屈，也不愿行不义”，这样至少能够与自己和睦相处。我们只能在具体的处境中，冒着风险，真诚地做出自己独立的判断，并为此承担责任。这就是现代社会的公民格外艰巨的道德任务。\n7. 卡尔·波普尔指出：人类是容易犯错的物种，这是人类固有的特征。他提出“证伪主义”理论：科学理论的标志不是它能够被证明是对的，而是它可以被证明是错的。他说，科学的正确永远是一种不彻底的正确。科学理论本身必须包含“经验上被证伪”的可能性，这才是区别科学与非科学理论的试金石。\n8. 科普尔重新定义了科学发展的逻辑，用经验检测的“可证伪性”代替“可证实性”，用“问题-猜想-反驳”的“试错机制”代替“观察-归纳-证实”的“实证机制”。科学无法达到绝对的真理。就算某个理论现在是正确的，也没法保证以后不会被推翻。科学是一种特定的认知方式，并不是能一统天下的思想方式。科普尔是科学至上论的批判者。\n9. 科普尔提出他的基本的哲学思想“批判理性主义”，也即“人类有理性，理性有局限”。理性体现在我们能够找到解决问题的办法，可错性体现在，人类的办法总是不完美的，总会出现新的问题。人既是理性的动物，又是会犯错的动物。科普尔在社会政治上反对历史决定论和乌托邦社会工程。反对过去启蒙理性主义中的绝对真理观。\n10. 乌托邦社会工程有一个鲜明的特点，就是“整体主义”。整体主义的规划工程的问题就是低估了可错性。\n11. 人类社会有一个特点，那就是人类的知识本身就是影响历史发展的一个重要变量，因此历史进程无法被决定，也就无法用科学方法来预测。\n12. 弗里德里希·哈耶克提出“自发秩序”。比如乡间的小路、语言、法律、市场的价格机制。以亚当·斯密和大卫·休谟代表的”苏格兰启蒙运动“，承认理性的重要性，反对“理论万能论”，批判“理性的自负”，即对人类的理性能力抱有过度的信心。\n13. 康德曾经说，人类的不成熟状态就是不敢公开大胆地运用理性。哈耶克则进一步揭示出，如果妄想用理性彻底征服无知，消除所有的不确定性，这是人类的另一种不成熟。事实上，人类真正的成熟，是在勇敢运用理性的同时，直面自己永远不可能完全摆脱的无知，勇敢地与不确定性共存。\n14. “冷战自由派”，主要活跃在冷战时期，各自的学术专业虽然不同，但是都属于广义的自由主义立场，都格外重视思想观念的巨大威力。比如波普尔、哈耶克、柏林。\n15. 以赛亚·柏林有两个主题，一个是价值多元论，一个是“两种自由”的理论。\n16. 所谓“价值”指的是那些我们认为重要的理念。柏林认为，人类的生活世界存在着多种不同的终极价值，这些价值是客观的或真实的，但它们之间常常无法公度，不能彼此兼容，甚至可能发生严重的冲突。柏林告诫我们：应当抗拒形而上学一元论的诱惑，接受价值多元的人类处境。柏林主张自己不是价值主观主义，也不是相对主义。柏林强调，价值虽然是多元的，但仍然是客观存在的，不是主观想象的随意构造。\n17. 柏林认为，价值虽然是多样，但不是无限的。同时，柏林坚持认为，人类具有某种最低限度的“共通性”。即使双方价值追求不同，甚至可能会因此开战，但你我仍然可以想象、可以理解对方为什么会追求这种价值。\n18. 两种自由，“消极自由”和“积极自由”。消极自由，简单来说就是我不想要什么、就可以不要什么。积极自由就是我想要做什么、就可以去做。消极自由，就是不受到外部的干涉和阻碍。积极自由，就是可以用理性来掌控、实现自己的目标。消极自由更像是一种机会，只要保留这个机会，就算什么都不做，你也保持了你的消极自由。自由必定有一个行动主体。在积极自由中，主体被划分成两部分，一部分是“真正的”“高级的”“理性的”自我，还有一个是“虚假的”“低级的”“非理性的”。积极自由的目标往往是指，那个理性的自我能够主导自己，去实现高级的目标。\n19. 柏林说：“自由的根本意义是摆脱枷锁、摆脱囚禁、摆脱他人奴役的自由。其他都是这个意义的延伸，或者是某种隐喻。”柏林承认，在特定情况下，强制可能是必要的，消极自由有可能需要向其它价值让步，甚至做出牺牲。但是牺牲就是牺牲，不应该玩弄“概念魔术”，把牺牲改头换面变成“更高的自由”。\n20. 赫伯特·马尔库塞发明的一个术语，“虚假的需求”。虚假的需求不是源自你自然的生活需要，而是被市场营销制造出来的。\n21. 马尔库塞曾说，像美国这样的发达工业社会是一种“新型的极权主义”，它不是用恐怖的手段来控制大众，而是用无尽的消费和享受来贿赂大众，让人们陷入“舒舒服服的不自由”之中，难以察觉社会对自己的控制，也就无从反抗。\n22. 马克思发现了“劳动异化”现象。马克思说，劳动是人的本质特征，是人的第一需要。但是，在资本主义条件下，工人感到劳动是一种与自己对立的苦役，完全是异己的活动，这就是劳动的异化。马克思说，“工人在自己的劳动中不是肯定自己，而是否定自己，不是感受幸福，而是感到不幸，不是自由地发挥自己的体力和智力，而是使自己的肉体受折磨、精神遭摧残。。。”，“动物的东西成了人的东西，而人的东西成为动物的东西。”\n23. 马尔库塞的思想对20世纪60、70年代的青年抗议有很大的影响，但他拒绝接受“导师”之类的称号，认为自己只是辨析和阐明运动本身所蕴含的想法、目标和意义。现在回头看那场运动，它并没有在根本上改变资本主义的政治经济制度，不过带来重要的文化变革，几乎改写了传统的主流观点，在此后的数十年间，持续在校园和公共领域中发出批判性的声音。\n\n# 第四章 自由主义及其批判者\n1. 自由主义有着丰富的内在多样性，多样性造就了它的一个特点：某种自由主义的没落甚至消失，不会牵连自由主义思想整体的命运。\n2. 约翰·罗尔斯，20世界最伟大的政治哲学家，在1971年发表的《正义论》的开篇中说“正义是社会制度的首要价值，正像真理是思想体系的首要价值一样”。罗尔斯通过无知之幕的思想实验，推理论证了一个正义的社会契约中最关键的两条原则。第一条原则是要保障平等的基本自由，第二条原则是，社会经济的不平等分配，必须满足两个限定条件，一个是“公平的机会平等”，一个是要满足差异原则。\n3. 无知之幕，就是一个人站在无知之幕后面，屏蔽一切的个人特征，只保留理性能力，然后签订契约来做出分配，然后你自己再从这里出来获得是随机分配的结果，为了避免自己拿到最大的分配结果，你就需要尽可能做到公平公正。\n4. 在罗伯特·诺齐克看来，罗尔斯在政治权利方面坚持了自由主义原则，让每个人享有基本自由，但在社会经济领域，却没有一以贯之地坚持这个原则，而是把平等分配当作默认选项。罗伯特·诺齐克主张一种完全彻底的自由主义理论，无论是政治领域还是社会经济问题上，都要把个人权利放在最高位置。这种被称为“自由至上论”（也译为“自由放任主义”）。\n5. 诺齐克的论证的关键点，第一，他所有论证的起点是个人权利的绝对优先，对个体权利做出任何限制，都要给出很强的正当理由，方可被接受。第二，他主张在政治、经济和社会等领域全方位地坚持自由原则。尤其在社会经济问题上，他对一种不受任何干预的自由市场资本主义做出了道德辩护。诺齐克讲的正义不是“分配的正义”，而是“持有的正义”。核心问题就是，在什么条件下，我们持有的东西在道德上才是正当的呢？\n6. 诺齐克的论证有一个出发点：我们最初能正当拥有的是什么呢？当然是我们自己，诺齐克称之为“自我所有权”当然仅仅拥有自己是活不下去的，我们还需要获得资源和财产。诺齐克提出了他的三项正义原则，第一，“获取正义”，就是你所持有的财产在起点上，也就是要最初获取的时候必须是正当的。第二，“转让正义”，如果财产从一个人转义到另一个人手里，整个过程没有巧取豪夺，是用过自由自愿的交换或者馈赠，那转让就是正当的。第三，“矫正正义”，对那些通过不正当的方式得到的财产持有，不管经历多少变化，都必须予以矫正。\n7. 诺齐克心目中理想的国家形态，是一种“最小国家”。这样的国家行使的功能非常有限：只要保障个体公民的基本自由和安全，以及确保合法契约的执行，就不应当再有其他功能。对于个人之间自由自愿的交易活动，政府也无权干预。\n8. 诺齐克的是一种“历史正义”理论，只要财产的来路清白，无论多寡都是正义的。罗尔斯的是一种“模式正义”理论，就是社会经济的分配必须满足某种结构模式。\n9. 罗纳德·德沃金提出：平等的尊重、平等的关怀。要实现“平等的关怀”，首先要识别哪些需求是自己不能选择的处境造成的，哪些是个人自愿选择的偏好造成的。对于前一种情况，应当弥补处境造成的差别，而对于后一种情况，应当接受选择造成的差异。这就是他和罗尔斯的差异。\n10. 迈克尔·桑德尔看来，自由主义的个人观，把个人看作是孤立的原子，完全借自己的自由意志来行动，他称之为“无牵挂的个人”。这是错误的，是对社会的错误理解。自由主义，比如诺齐克往往倾向于“工具性的社群观”，就是认为社群只有工具性的意义。罗尔斯主张“情感性的社群观”，认为社会是一个合作互惠的体系，人们在合作中会产生善意和情感，建立共同的价值。但桑德尔认为，这样的社群没有真正的依赖，也没有形成真正的团结。比如，恋人之间也有感情，该分手还是会分手。桑德尔提出“构成性的社群”：社群是“构成性的”，社群实际上“构成”了你这个人。个人当然会做出选择，但个人的目标并不是随意选择的，而是与社群紧密联系在一起的。社群是一种纽带关系，它在根本上定义了“你是谁”，它塑造了你的身份认同、生活理想、道德感和责任意识。\n11. 迈克尔·沃尔泽指出，社群主义对自由主义的批评有两个要点：第一，自由主义的理论是虚假的，现实中根本不存在这种无所牵挂的原子化个人；第二，自由主义的实践是有害的，造成了自我中心、相互分裂的冷漠社会。沃尔泽认为，自由主义的理论真实反应了现实，所谓“孤立的自我”确实存在。他们并不是脱离社会的存在，个人确实是被社会塑造的，社群主义的这个观点没有错。但是，社群主义没有看到现代社会已经改变了。现代社会一个突出的特点就是高度的“流动性”，总是在移动和变化。第一，“地理上的流动”。第二，“社会身份的流动”，比如过往“子承父业”的传统越老越难以维系。第三，“婚姻关系的流动”。第四，“政治的流动”。现代社会中的社群改变成了“自愿型的社群”。由于前面所说的四种流动性始终存在，现代社会永远都处于运动之中，沃尔泽把这种特征称为“后社会的状况”。那种孤立的、近乎原子的自我，就并不是自由主义虚构出来的“先于社会的自我”观念，而是“后社会状况”造成的。沃尔泽称之为“后社会的自我”观念。这种自我观念反映了自由流动社会的现实，它从根本上失去了确定性和统一性，个人不得不随时重新创造自己。\n12. 从集体主义到个人主义的转向，并不是东西方文明的差别，而是古今之变所致。\n13. 查尔斯·泰勒认为，自我无法凭空创造发明自己的价值和意义标准。自由选择和价值判断需要依据价值尺度，而价值尺度不可能由“自我”来发明创造，我们只能“选用”和“改造”价值尺度，这正是泰勒的社群主义观点带来的启发：个人自主性的来源不可能是“唯我论”的独白，而只能来自关系性的对话。\n14. 本真性的理想，一方面让我们忠实于自己的内心感受，一方面要求我们不要陷入唯我论的独白，积极地介入对话和反思，这是自我通过共同背景的通道，把我们和一个更开阔的世界联系在一起。最终，向对话和反思开放，让我变得更加清醒、更加丰富，才能更好地“成为自己”。\n15. 如果人类所有的活动都发生在人与人之间，那么主体和主体之间就会形成一种关系，尤尔根·哈贝马斯称之为“主体间性”。人类是语言动物，所以人不是独自的存在，而是在人间交往对话的存在。语言交流，互相交往是我们所行动的共同基础。可以用“在人间”三个字概括。哈贝马斯区分了几种言谈行动。一是“策略行动”，你的言谈只是要达到特定的功利性目标。一是“交往行动”，是为了真正理解彼此而展开的对话交谈。哈贝马斯提出“交往理性”，交往理性从来不是一个人的道理，而是大家一起来把道理讲通。这不并不是简单的乌托邦，而是认为交往理性为我们的生活确立了理性规范的原则基础，以此在“生活世界”来抵御“系统的殖民”。\n\n# 尾声：后冷战时代的争论\n1. 西弗朗斯·福山提出“历史终结论”，认为政治上的自由民主制和经济上的市场资本主义是现代的政治经济制度，并不专属于任何特定的文化。它们只是因为起源于西方，就被误以为是西方特有的制度。但实际上，这种制度选择，虽然会受到文化因素的影响，但文化并不是决定性的。福山相信，这种制度在本质上是现代化的结果，而现代化是全人类发展的普遍逻辑。\n2. 塞缪尔·亨廷顿提出“文明冲突论”，世界上有七种主要的文明类型，西方文明只是其中的一种，还有中华文明、印度文明、伊斯兰文明等。他认为，自由民主政治和市场资本主义都高度依赖于西方文明，尤其是民主政治，它是基督教文化的特定产物。所以，非西方文明很难接受西方文明的制度，日本只是一个例外。\n3. 如果制度是特定文化的产物，那么它就只能适用于特定的文化。但如果制度本身可以塑造和改变文化，那么即便文化传统不同的国家也可以采用大致相似的现代制度。\n4. 福山的《历史的终结于最后的人》用两种论证方法来论证他的观点，历史哲学的论证和政治科学的论证。福山认为，自由民主主义就是历史的终点，认为历史发展的根本动力是“为承认而斗争”，直到普遍而平等的相互承认来临了，发展的动力就被耗尽了。从政治科学的角度来说，福山认为只要搞现代化，最后都趋近普遍的共同模式。福山为现代化的普遍化进程，做了个三阶段的推论。只要人们追求现代化，就会发展科学技术；发展科学技术，就会采用市场经济；而发展市场经济，就会导致自由民主制。\n5. 福山承认，民主化的进程可能会出现回潮和逆转，也承认这个进程比他最初预想的更漫长，也更艰难，但他依然没有放弃他的一个核心观点：自由主义民主体制之外的现代模式，迟早会面临民主化的压力，会遭遇巨大的挑战而难以长期维系。在这个意义上，他表示“就长远来说”，自由民主政体具有难以抗拒的优势，仍然会在曲折发展中越来越盛行。\n6. 亨廷顿是一个政治现实主义者，他认为文明差异不可消除，冲突不可根除，只能管控；世界秩序只能建立在多种文明共存的基础之上。\n7. 自由主义民主鼓励多元化的立场和观点，但也需要最低限度的政治共识。而极端分裂的民意会让自由民主化政治陷入严重的困境。\n8.人类因为理性而伟大，因为知道理性的局限而成熟。\n\n# 补充\n1. 人生意义是一个“终极关怀”问题，对终极性的问题，我们并没有终极性的答案，我们都是一直“在路上”的。这是人之为人的“存在性特征”。\n2. 未经考察的人生是不值得过的人生，过度考察的人生是没法过的人生。\n3. 尼采说：“现在我要你们丢开我去发现自己，只有当你们全部否定我的时候，我才会回到你们身边。”\n4. 我们每个人都具有一定程度的自主性，可以自己掌握自己。我们永远在被驱动和驱动自己之间。所以，人并不屈从于决定论，至少不服从生物决定论，虽然我们不可能完全自由。\n5. 消极自由是摆脱障碍的自由，但柏林对“障碍”做了四项限定（也就是说，某些因素必须满足这些特别的限定，才称得上是“对消极自由构成了障碍”），他们分别是：外部性限定；人为性限定；机会限定；重要性限定。\n6. 许多人认为，思维品质就是逻辑思维，甚至就是形式逻辑水平。这是非常片面的看法。思想品质的提高，需要多种知识，需要视野和多方面的锤炼。形式逻辑是重要的，但只是思维方式的一种，而不是全部。\n7. 阿伦特认为存在一种流行的谬论，就是“相信真理是经历思考过程之后的结果”。阿伦特认为：“相反，真理一直是思考的开端，思考一直是没有结果的。这是'哲学'和科学之间的区别。科学是有结果的，而哲学从来没有。思考是在体验了真理之后开始的……真理不存在于思考中，用康德的话来说，真理是使思考成为可能的条件。它既是思考的开端，又是先验的。”\n8. 刘瑜老师说：“极端太有诱惑力了，它的确定性以及确定性带来的自信，它的简单以及简单带来的省心，它的易辨识以及因易辨识所迅速集结的情感群体，真的太有诱惑力了。从此不用在不同的观念之间颠沛流离，不用根据路况不断调整航向，不用经受自我怀疑的折磨，不用被渺小感经年累月地审判，这种人可能的确很幸福吧。”\n","source":"_posts/《刘擎：西方现代思想讲义》摘抄.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 《刘擎：西方现代思想讲义》摘抄\ntags: 随笔\ncomments: false\ncategories: 随笔\ndate: 2021-02-19 14:04:38\n---\n# 导论：\n1. 思想内在于现实，思想观念并不脱离于社会现实，而是内在于社会现实的。\n<!--more-->\n2. “现代”是一种新的时间意识，意指“当下或此刻”，对当下新颖性的敏感，是指一种新的时间意识，或者说历史观。\n3. 以上时间观带来的变化是。第一，生活不再是循环往复的，而是日新月异的，过去的经验很可能是靠不住的。第二，从“厚古薄今”转向“厚今薄古”，认为当下比过去重要，形成“线性进步的历史观”。第三，对人的创造性和主体性的肯定，使人从循环历史宿命中解放出来。\n4. “现代化”这个术语主要是指现代历史变革的过程，启蒙理性主义是推动变革产生的关键思想因素。“现代化”的结果造就了现代世界，它具有不同于传统社会的许多特征，“现代性”就是用来指称这些特征的术语。\n5. 古今之变，带来的几个变化，第一，个人主观赋予的价值变得极其重要，有时甚至能压倒其他一切标准。第二，人们观念中的自然秩序被理性给打破了。第三，自然的秩序被打破了，我们建立起来了理性的秩序。\n6. 启蒙就是用用理性的光芒打破黑暗，让人摆脱非理性的蒙昧，走向成熟。理性成为区分真理与蒙昧的决定性标准，成了衡量一切的准绳；理性甚至取代了神的位置，具有近乎上帝一般的神圣地位。\n7. 古今之变带来了两个基本观念上转变：一个是“人类中心主义的转变”，它指的是人看待世界的观念发生了变化；另一个是“个人主义的转变”，它是指人看待自己的观念发生了变化，或者说人的“自我理解”的转变。\n8. “个人主义的转向”，人首先是一个独立的个体，可以脱离任何一个群体进入别的去群体。这种转向带来了难以想象的个人自由，但代价就是个人失去了与一个特定群体的久远、厚重和牢固的纽带关系，这带来了孤独感、漂泊感和乡愁。这也是现代性困境的一部分。\n\n# 第一章 现代思想的成年\n1. 韦伯的思想的三个核心命题，“世界的祛魅”、“诸神之争”、“现代的铁笼”，以及一个重要的概念“工具理性”。\n2. “诸神之争”，指人们信奉的价值观。韦伯提出了事实判断和价值判断。事实判断有确定性。价值判断没有一个唯一正确的价值观，这带来了价值多元的问题。\n3. 韦伯提出人类理性包含两种，一是工具理性，二是价值理性。工具理性的计算，就是一种事实判断。价值理性的权衡是一种价值判断。在现代化的过程中，工具理性不断扩张，比如官僚制、绩效制。\n4. 理性化把现代铸造成了一个“铁笼”，人被“非人化”，被看做机器的零件。这样有两个弊端，一是一种片面的社会文化，一是一种片面的社会关系。这种牢笼是一个双刃剑，既是残酷的，也是对现代生活的一种保障。认为打破这个牢笼就能解决我们的问题，无疑是一种天真。\n\n# 第二章 现代人的精神危机\n1. 人在精神层面上总会面对两个根本性的人生难题，一个是死亡，一个是贪欲。也是终极关怀的两大难题。\n2. 克尔凯郭尔发现，你是无法完全依靠逻辑和推理来求证信仰为真、来确证它的可靠性。信仰与理性之间存在这鸿沟，这靠理性论证本身难以弥合，确立信仰在现代世界因为变得非常困难。\n3. 孙周兴老师概括的尼采的三大命题：一是人生虚无；二是理论虚假；三是生命强健。\n4. 尼采认为：面对无意义的世界和无意义的生命，人应该立足于现实，直面无意义的荒谬，以强大的生命本能舞蹈，在生命活动中创造出价值。从消极的虚无主义转向积极虚无主义。\n5. 尼采说，人类的高贵在于自身有决定价值的能力，面对虚无的人生，有两种截然不同的人生选择，奴隶道德和主人道德。\n6. 尼采的哲学充满激进的否定性，甚至对自己也毫不客气。\n7. 尼采提出，客观的事实真相可能根本不存在。“没有事实，只有阐释。”，“视角是所有生活的基本条件。”，也就是视角主义。视角决定事实。\n8. 视角主义教给我们的，不是分裂的必然，而是谦逊的必要。我们应该认识到，我们了解的真相并不是绝对的真相，应该保持倾听、理解和学习的心态去了解它们。\n9. 弗洛伊德提出，在精神意义上，没有人是绝对健康的，正常和不正常之间并不是泾渭分明的。人的精神结构就像一座冰山，人能意识到的只是浮出水面的一小部分，在水面之下还有巨大的一部分，这就是无意识。\n10. 弗洛伊德提出“精神分析学说”，里面一个重要的内容就是，人格三元说。即，本我，自我和超我。\n11. 弗洛伊德的精神分析学说，在心理学界渐渐走向了衰落，但是在思想文化界的影响很大，塑造着我们的精神生活。从此，对于人的理解核心不再是理性而是欲望，至少也是理性和欲望的不断冲突。欲望被看作是不可否认、不可抹杀的生命驱动力。\n12. “可证伪”，就是有可能被经验证据证明是错误的。一个科学理论需要直面不符合理论的事实，直面对自身不利的证据。如果你提出一个科学理论，那么这个理论不能宣称自己永远正确、能够解释所有的经验证据。如果能够解释一切，这就成了伪科学，伪科学就是永远能够自圆其说。\n13. 萨特的思想，有两个重要的概念，一个是自由选择，一个是积极行动。萨特还有一句非常有名的话：“存在就是虚无”。存在是虚无的，人也厌恶虚无，厌恶虚无背后的缺失和不确定性。所以我们总是需要去填满自己的虚无，去获得某种本质。\n14. 萨特提出一对概念来区分物的存在和人的存在。他把物的那种被决定的、不能改变的存在，叫作“自在”的存在。把人的这种“有待形成”的、不固定的存在，叫作“自为”的存在，就是自己“为自己”而存在。自在的存在有一个固定不变的本质；而自为的存在没有固定的本质，它的本质是可以变化的。\n15. 人永远不会“是”什么，而是永远正在“成为”什么。萨特的存在主义哲学，最突出的一个导向，就是呼唤人们面对存在的真相。存在就是虚无，存在先于预先的本质。如果“本质”决定了命运，那么先于本质而存在的人就不被任何命运所限定，也就说，人在根本上是自由的。\n16. 萨特的两个著名观点，第一，自由选择是很沉重的负担；第二，“他人就是地狱”。因为自由选择必定带来后果，你做了选择，就要独自承担这份后果，你所有的选择，依据都是你自己，你就是自己的标准，要为自己的每一个选择承担绝对的责任。从“存在就是虚无”，萨特推出了人的绝对自由；而从绝对的自由，萨特又推出了绝对的责任。\n17. 人能够自由地掌握自己的生命，哲学上把这叫作人的主体性。我是主体，就意味着我有主导权。在萨特看来，人和人的交往，总是在为了争夺主体性而斗争。即使是爱情当中也不例外。我们生活在一个有他人存在的世界，每个人都是自由的，但是我们不可能实现那种理想中的共同自由，因为每个人都要实现自己的主体性，人与人之间只有永恒的斗争。萨特是一个悲观主义者，他不相信自由主义所向往的那种主体和主体之间的相互承认、平等尊重的关系。\n\n# 第三章 20世纪的教训\n1. 政治学有两个基本假设，第一个是“资源匮乏”假设，认为人类生活中所需要的资源总是匮乏的。第二个是“人性自利”假设。\n2. 对于政府和国家的特征，马克思·韦伯提出过一个著名的定义：在特定的领土之内对暴力的合法垄断。\n3. 政治学家霍布斯、卢梭和洛克等提出来了不同版本的“社会契约论”，为现代的政治权威提供依据理由。不同版本的社会契约论之间有很多差异，但都分享了两个基本特征。第一，都主张先存在自然社会，然后才建立政府。也就是说，政府不是天然存在的，而是派生的“人造之物”。第二，都主张“同意理论”，政治权威的统治合法性来自被统治者的同意，是自下而上的，而不是自反的。\n4. 齐格门·鲍曼通过《现代性和大屠杀》来分析现代性和纳粹大屠杀之间的关联性。第一，正是机器般理性的现代官僚制，实现了大屠杀这个非理性的暴行。第二，现代科学主义提供了“园艺文化”来为大屠杀提供理念支持，园艺文化看待社会，认为社会秩序是一项工程，可以在科学理性的指导下整理的干干净净，整齐划一，清晰优美。第三，纳粹对受害者理性计算心理的利用，给受害者提供选项，调整其中的收益，去引导受害者合作。不过，这不是说大屠杀是现代社会的必然，在鲍曼看来，要防范大屠杀这样的灾难，关键在于要坚守一种不可让步的、无条件的道德感，保持对他人的道德感知。简单来说，就是永远别忘了你面前的人是一个人。\n5. 汉娜·阿伦特指出纳粹的动机不是出自人性的自私、贪婪、恐惧、复仇欲望或者施虐欲望，纯粹就是把犹太人看作是多余的东西，要“根除人这个概念本身”。由此提出了“极端之恶”和“平庸之恶”。即，纳粹大屠杀是一种极端的恶，经由一些“平庸”的罪犯犯下执行的。这些罪犯身上的这种“恶的平庸性”，其实质是不去思考，是丧失了思考能力。\n6. 汉娜·阿伦特主张，传统的道德法则和教化已经不能促成真正的道德思考了。道德的真正含义不是循规蹈矩，而是要做出自己独立的是非对错。要保持独立判断，反对盲从。道德思考没有通则可循，独立的道德判断是艰巨的任务。苏格拉底说过“宁可自己遭受冤屈，也不愿行不义”，这样至少能够与自己和睦相处。我们只能在具体的处境中，冒着风险，真诚地做出自己独立的判断，并为此承担责任。这就是现代社会的公民格外艰巨的道德任务。\n7. 卡尔·波普尔指出：人类是容易犯错的物种，这是人类固有的特征。他提出“证伪主义”理论：科学理论的标志不是它能够被证明是对的，而是它可以被证明是错的。他说，科学的正确永远是一种不彻底的正确。科学理论本身必须包含“经验上被证伪”的可能性，这才是区别科学与非科学理论的试金石。\n8. 科普尔重新定义了科学发展的逻辑，用经验检测的“可证伪性”代替“可证实性”，用“问题-猜想-反驳”的“试错机制”代替“观察-归纳-证实”的“实证机制”。科学无法达到绝对的真理。就算某个理论现在是正确的，也没法保证以后不会被推翻。科学是一种特定的认知方式，并不是能一统天下的思想方式。科普尔是科学至上论的批判者。\n9. 科普尔提出他的基本的哲学思想“批判理性主义”，也即“人类有理性，理性有局限”。理性体现在我们能够找到解决问题的办法，可错性体现在，人类的办法总是不完美的，总会出现新的问题。人既是理性的动物，又是会犯错的动物。科普尔在社会政治上反对历史决定论和乌托邦社会工程。反对过去启蒙理性主义中的绝对真理观。\n10. 乌托邦社会工程有一个鲜明的特点，就是“整体主义”。整体主义的规划工程的问题就是低估了可错性。\n11. 人类社会有一个特点，那就是人类的知识本身就是影响历史发展的一个重要变量，因此历史进程无法被决定，也就无法用科学方法来预测。\n12. 弗里德里希·哈耶克提出“自发秩序”。比如乡间的小路、语言、法律、市场的价格机制。以亚当·斯密和大卫·休谟代表的”苏格兰启蒙运动“，承认理性的重要性，反对“理论万能论”，批判“理性的自负”，即对人类的理性能力抱有过度的信心。\n13. 康德曾经说，人类的不成熟状态就是不敢公开大胆地运用理性。哈耶克则进一步揭示出，如果妄想用理性彻底征服无知，消除所有的不确定性，这是人类的另一种不成熟。事实上，人类真正的成熟，是在勇敢运用理性的同时，直面自己永远不可能完全摆脱的无知，勇敢地与不确定性共存。\n14. “冷战自由派”，主要活跃在冷战时期，各自的学术专业虽然不同，但是都属于广义的自由主义立场，都格外重视思想观念的巨大威力。比如波普尔、哈耶克、柏林。\n15. 以赛亚·柏林有两个主题，一个是价值多元论，一个是“两种自由”的理论。\n16. 所谓“价值”指的是那些我们认为重要的理念。柏林认为，人类的生活世界存在着多种不同的终极价值，这些价值是客观的或真实的，但它们之间常常无法公度，不能彼此兼容，甚至可能发生严重的冲突。柏林告诫我们：应当抗拒形而上学一元论的诱惑，接受价值多元的人类处境。柏林主张自己不是价值主观主义，也不是相对主义。柏林强调，价值虽然是多元的，但仍然是客观存在的，不是主观想象的随意构造。\n17. 柏林认为，价值虽然是多样，但不是无限的。同时，柏林坚持认为，人类具有某种最低限度的“共通性”。即使双方价值追求不同，甚至可能会因此开战，但你我仍然可以想象、可以理解对方为什么会追求这种价值。\n18. 两种自由，“消极自由”和“积极自由”。消极自由，简单来说就是我不想要什么、就可以不要什么。积极自由就是我想要做什么、就可以去做。消极自由，就是不受到外部的干涉和阻碍。积极自由，就是可以用理性来掌控、实现自己的目标。消极自由更像是一种机会，只要保留这个机会，就算什么都不做，你也保持了你的消极自由。自由必定有一个行动主体。在积极自由中，主体被划分成两部分，一部分是“真正的”“高级的”“理性的”自我，还有一个是“虚假的”“低级的”“非理性的”。积极自由的目标往往是指，那个理性的自我能够主导自己，去实现高级的目标。\n19. 柏林说：“自由的根本意义是摆脱枷锁、摆脱囚禁、摆脱他人奴役的自由。其他都是这个意义的延伸，或者是某种隐喻。”柏林承认，在特定情况下，强制可能是必要的，消极自由有可能需要向其它价值让步，甚至做出牺牲。但是牺牲就是牺牲，不应该玩弄“概念魔术”，把牺牲改头换面变成“更高的自由”。\n20. 赫伯特·马尔库塞发明的一个术语，“虚假的需求”。虚假的需求不是源自你自然的生活需要，而是被市场营销制造出来的。\n21. 马尔库塞曾说，像美国这样的发达工业社会是一种“新型的极权主义”，它不是用恐怖的手段来控制大众，而是用无尽的消费和享受来贿赂大众，让人们陷入“舒舒服服的不自由”之中，难以察觉社会对自己的控制，也就无从反抗。\n22. 马克思发现了“劳动异化”现象。马克思说，劳动是人的本质特征，是人的第一需要。但是，在资本主义条件下，工人感到劳动是一种与自己对立的苦役，完全是异己的活动，这就是劳动的异化。马克思说，“工人在自己的劳动中不是肯定自己，而是否定自己，不是感受幸福，而是感到不幸，不是自由地发挥自己的体力和智力，而是使自己的肉体受折磨、精神遭摧残。。。”，“动物的东西成了人的东西，而人的东西成为动物的东西。”\n23. 马尔库塞的思想对20世纪60、70年代的青年抗议有很大的影响，但他拒绝接受“导师”之类的称号，认为自己只是辨析和阐明运动本身所蕴含的想法、目标和意义。现在回头看那场运动，它并没有在根本上改变资本主义的政治经济制度，不过带来重要的文化变革，几乎改写了传统的主流观点，在此后的数十年间，持续在校园和公共领域中发出批判性的声音。\n\n# 第四章 自由主义及其批判者\n1. 自由主义有着丰富的内在多样性，多样性造就了它的一个特点：某种自由主义的没落甚至消失，不会牵连自由主义思想整体的命运。\n2. 约翰·罗尔斯，20世界最伟大的政治哲学家，在1971年发表的《正义论》的开篇中说“正义是社会制度的首要价值，正像真理是思想体系的首要价值一样”。罗尔斯通过无知之幕的思想实验，推理论证了一个正义的社会契约中最关键的两条原则。第一条原则是要保障平等的基本自由，第二条原则是，社会经济的不平等分配，必须满足两个限定条件，一个是“公平的机会平等”，一个是要满足差异原则。\n3. 无知之幕，就是一个人站在无知之幕后面，屏蔽一切的个人特征，只保留理性能力，然后签订契约来做出分配，然后你自己再从这里出来获得是随机分配的结果，为了避免自己拿到最大的分配结果，你就需要尽可能做到公平公正。\n4. 在罗伯特·诺齐克看来，罗尔斯在政治权利方面坚持了自由主义原则，让每个人享有基本自由，但在社会经济领域，却没有一以贯之地坚持这个原则，而是把平等分配当作默认选项。罗伯特·诺齐克主张一种完全彻底的自由主义理论，无论是政治领域还是社会经济问题上，都要把个人权利放在最高位置。这种被称为“自由至上论”（也译为“自由放任主义”）。\n5. 诺齐克的论证的关键点，第一，他所有论证的起点是个人权利的绝对优先，对个体权利做出任何限制，都要给出很强的正当理由，方可被接受。第二，他主张在政治、经济和社会等领域全方位地坚持自由原则。尤其在社会经济问题上，他对一种不受任何干预的自由市场资本主义做出了道德辩护。诺齐克讲的正义不是“分配的正义”，而是“持有的正义”。核心问题就是，在什么条件下，我们持有的东西在道德上才是正当的呢？\n6. 诺齐克的论证有一个出发点：我们最初能正当拥有的是什么呢？当然是我们自己，诺齐克称之为“自我所有权”当然仅仅拥有自己是活不下去的，我们还需要获得资源和财产。诺齐克提出了他的三项正义原则，第一，“获取正义”，就是你所持有的财产在起点上，也就是要最初获取的时候必须是正当的。第二，“转让正义”，如果财产从一个人转义到另一个人手里，整个过程没有巧取豪夺，是用过自由自愿的交换或者馈赠，那转让就是正当的。第三，“矫正正义”，对那些通过不正当的方式得到的财产持有，不管经历多少变化，都必须予以矫正。\n7. 诺齐克心目中理想的国家形态，是一种“最小国家”。这样的国家行使的功能非常有限：只要保障个体公民的基本自由和安全，以及确保合法契约的执行，就不应当再有其他功能。对于个人之间自由自愿的交易活动，政府也无权干预。\n8. 诺齐克的是一种“历史正义”理论，只要财产的来路清白，无论多寡都是正义的。罗尔斯的是一种“模式正义”理论，就是社会经济的分配必须满足某种结构模式。\n9. 罗纳德·德沃金提出：平等的尊重、平等的关怀。要实现“平等的关怀”，首先要识别哪些需求是自己不能选择的处境造成的，哪些是个人自愿选择的偏好造成的。对于前一种情况，应当弥补处境造成的差别，而对于后一种情况，应当接受选择造成的差异。这就是他和罗尔斯的差异。\n10. 迈克尔·桑德尔看来，自由主义的个人观，把个人看作是孤立的原子，完全借自己的自由意志来行动，他称之为“无牵挂的个人”。这是错误的，是对社会的错误理解。自由主义，比如诺齐克往往倾向于“工具性的社群观”，就是认为社群只有工具性的意义。罗尔斯主张“情感性的社群观”，认为社会是一个合作互惠的体系，人们在合作中会产生善意和情感，建立共同的价值。但桑德尔认为，这样的社群没有真正的依赖，也没有形成真正的团结。比如，恋人之间也有感情，该分手还是会分手。桑德尔提出“构成性的社群”：社群是“构成性的”，社群实际上“构成”了你这个人。个人当然会做出选择，但个人的目标并不是随意选择的，而是与社群紧密联系在一起的。社群是一种纽带关系，它在根本上定义了“你是谁”，它塑造了你的身份认同、生活理想、道德感和责任意识。\n11. 迈克尔·沃尔泽指出，社群主义对自由主义的批评有两个要点：第一，自由主义的理论是虚假的，现实中根本不存在这种无所牵挂的原子化个人；第二，自由主义的实践是有害的，造成了自我中心、相互分裂的冷漠社会。沃尔泽认为，自由主义的理论真实反应了现实，所谓“孤立的自我”确实存在。他们并不是脱离社会的存在，个人确实是被社会塑造的，社群主义的这个观点没有错。但是，社群主义没有看到现代社会已经改变了。现代社会一个突出的特点就是高度的“流动性”，总是在移动和变化。第一，“地理上的流动”。第二，“社会身份的流动”，比如过往“子承父业”的传统越老越难以维系。第三，“婚姻关系的流动”。第四，“政治的流动”。现代社会中的社群改变成了“自愿型的社群”。由于前面所说的四种流动性始终存在，现代社会永远都处于运动之中，沃尔泽把这种特征称为“后社会的状况”。那种孤立的、近乎原子的自我，就并不是自由主义虚构出来的“先于社会的自我”观念，而是“后社会状况”造成的。沃尔泽称之为“后社会的自我”观念。这种自我观念反映了自由流动社会的现实，它从根本上失去了确定性和统一性，个人不得不随时重新创造自己。\n12. 从集体主义到个人主义的转向，并不是东西方文明的差别，而是古今之变所致。\n13. 查尔斯·泰勒认为，自我无法凭空创造发明自己的价值和意义标准。自由选择和价值判断需要依据价值尺度，而价值尺度不可能由“自我”来发明创造，我们只能“选用”和“改造”价值尺度，这正是泰勒的社群主义观点带来的启发：个人自主性的来源不可能是“唯我论”的独白，而只能来自关系性的对话。\n14. 本真性的理想，一方面让我们忠实于自己的内心感受，一方面要求我们不要陷入唯我论的独白，积极地介入对话和反思，这是自我通过共同背景的通道，把我们和一个更开阔的世界联系在一起。最终，向对话和反思开放，让我变得更加清醒、更加丰富，才能更好地“成为自己”。\n15. 如果人类所有的活动都发生在人与人之间，那么主体和主体之间就会形成一种关系，尤尔根·哈贝马斯称之为“主体间性”。人类是语言动物，所以人不是独自的存在，而是在人间交往对话的存在。语言交流，互相交往是我们所行动的共同基础。可以用“在人间”三个字概括。哈贝马斯区分了几种言谈行动。一是“策略行动”，你的言谈只是要达到特定的功利性目标。一是“交往行动”，是为了真正理解彼此而展开的对话交谈。哈贝马斯提出“交往理性”，交往理性从来不是一个人的道理，而是大家一起来把道理讲通。这不并不是简单的乌托邦，而是认为交往理性为我们的生活确立了理性规范的原则基础，以此在“生活世界”来抵御“系统的殖民”。\n\n# 尾声：后冷战时代的争论\n1. 西弗朗斯·福山提出“历史终结论”，认为政治上的自由民主制和经济上的市场资本主义是现代的政治经济制度，并不专属于任何特定的文化。它们只是因为起源于西方，就被误以为是西方特有的制度。但实际上，这种制度选择，虽然会受到文化因素的影响，但文化并不是决定性的。福山相信，这种制度在本质上是现代化的结果，而现代化是全人类发展的普遍逻辑。\n2. 塞缪尔·亨廷顿提出“文明冲突论”，世界上有七种主要的文明类型，西方文明只是其中的一种，还有中华文明、印度文明、伊斯兰文明等。他认为，自由民主政治和市场资本主义都高度依赖于西方文明，尤其是民主政治，它是基督教文化的特定产物。所以，非西方文明很难接受西方文明的制度，日本只是一个例外。\n3. 如果制度是特定文化的产物，那么它就只能适用于特定的文化。但如果制度本身可以塑造和改变文化，那么即便文化传统不同的国家也可以采用大致相似的现代制度。\n4. 福山的《历史的终结于最后的人》用两种论证方法来论证他的观点，历史哲学的论证和政治科学的论证。福山认为，自由民主主义就是历史的终点，认为历史发展的根本动力是“为承认而斗争”，直到普遍而平等的相互承认来临了，发展的动力就被耗尽了。从政治科学的角度来说，福山认为只要搞现代化，最后都趋近普遍的共同模式。福山为现代化的普遍化进程，做了个三阶段的推论。只要人们追求现代化，就会发展科学技术；发展科学技术，就会采用市场经济；而发展市场经济，就会导致自由民主制。\n5. 福山承认，民主化的进程可能会出现回潮和逆转，也承认这个进程比他最初预想的更漫长，也更艰难，但他依然没有放弃他的一个核心观点：自由主义民主体制之外的现代模式，迟早会面临民主化的压力，会遭遇巨大的挑战而难以长期维系。在这个意义上，他表示“就长远来说”，自由民主政体具有难以抗拒的优势，仍然会在曲折发展中越来越盛行。\n6. 亨廷顿是一个政治现实主义者，他认为文明差异不可消除，冲突不可根除，只能管控；世界秩序只能建立在多种文明共存的基础之上。\n7. 自由主义民主鼓励多元化的立场和观点，但也需要最低限度的政治共识。而极端分裂的民意会让自由民主化政治陷入严重的困境。\n8.人类因为理性而伟大，因为知道理性的局限而成熟。\n\n# 补充\n1. 人生意义是一个“终极关怀”问题，对终极性的问题，我们并没有终极性的答案，我们都是一直“在路上”的。这是人之为人的“存在性特征”。\n2. 未经考察的人生是不值得过的人生，过度考察的人生是没法过的人生。\n3. 尼采说：“现在我要你们丢开我去发现自己，只有当你们全部否定我的时候，我才会回到你们身边。”\n4. 我们每个人都具有一定程度的自主性，可以自己掌握自己。我们永远在被驱动和驱动自己之间。所以，人并不屈从于决定论，至少不服从生物决定论，虽然我们不可能完全自由。\n5. 消极自由是摆脱障碍的自由，但柏林对“障碍”做了四项限定（也就是说，某些因素必须满足这些特别的限定，才称得上是“对消极自由构成了障碍”），他们分别是：外部性限定；人为性限定；机会限定；重要性限定。\n6. 许多人认为，思维品质就是逻辑思维，甚至就是形式逻辑水平。这是非常片面的看法。思想品质的提高，需要多种知识，需要视野和多方面的锤炼。形式逻辑是重要的，但只是思维方式的一种，而不是全部。\n7. 阿伦特认为存在一种流行的谬论，就是“相信真理是经历思考过程之后的结果”。阿伦特认为：“相反，真理一直是思考的开端，思考一直是没有结果的。这是'哲学'和科学之间的区别。科学是有结果的，而哲学从来没有。思考是在体验了真理之后开始的……真理不存在于思考中，用康德的话来说，真理是使思考成为可能的条件。它既是思考的开端，又是先验的。”\n8. 刘瑜老师说：“极端太有诱惑力了，它的确定性以及确定性带来的自信，它的简单以及简单带来的省心，它的易辨识以及因易辨识所迅速集结的情感群体，真的太有诱惑力了。从此不用在不同的观念之间颠沛流离，不用根据路况不断调整航向，不用经受自我怀疑的折磨，不用被渺小感经年累月地审判，这种人可能的确很幸福吧。”\n","slug":"《刘擎：西方现代思想讲义》摘抄","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.500Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vksg0038pmnk1uhlg4ue","content":"<h1

id=\"第四章-自由主义及其批判者\">第四章 自由主义及其批判者</h1>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>自由主义有着丰富的内在多样性，多样性造就了它的一个特点：某种自由主义的没落甚至消失，不会牵连自由主义思想整体的命运。</li>\n<li>约翰·罗尔斯，20世界最伟大的政治哲学家，在1971年发表的《正义论》的开篇中说“正义是社会制度的首要价值，正像真理是思想体系的首要价值一样”。罗尔斯通过无知之幕的思想实验，推理论证了一个正义的社会契约中最关键的两条原则。第一条原则是要保障平等的基本自由，第二条原则是，社会经济的不平等分配，必须满足两个限定条件，一个是“公平的机会平等”，一个是要满足差异原则。</li>\n<li>无知之幕，就是一个人站在无知之幕后面，屏蔽一切的个人特征，只保留理性能力，然后签订契约来做出分配，然后你自己再从这里出来获得是随机分配的结果，为了避免自己拿到最大的分配结果，你就需要尽可能做到公平公正。</li>\n<li>在罗伯特·诺齐克看来，罗尔斯在政治权利方面坚持了自由主义原则，让每个人享有基本自由，但在社会经济领域，却没有一以贯之地坚持这个原则，而是把平等分配当作默认选项。罗伯特·诺齐克主张一种完全彻底的自由主义理论，无论是政治领域还是社会经济问题上，都要把个人权利放在最高位置。这种被称为“自由至上论”（也译为“自由放任主义”）。</li>\n<li>诺齐克的论证的关键点，第一，他所有论证的起点是个人权利的绝对优先，对个体权利做出任何限制，都要给出很强的正当理由，方可被接受。第二，他主张在政治、经济和社会等领域全方位地坚持自由原则。尤其在社会经济问题上，他对一种不受任何干预的自由市场资本主义做出了道德辩护。诺齐克讲的正义不是“分配的正义”，而是“持有的正义”。核心问题就是，在什么条件下，我们持有的东西在道德上才是正当的呢？</li>\n<li>诺齐克的论证有一个出发点：我们最初能正当拥有的是什么呢？当然是我们自己，诺齐克称之为“自我所有权”当然仅仅拥有自己是活不下去的，我们还需要获得资源和财产。诺齐克提出了他的三项正义原则，第一，“获取正义”，就是你所持有的财产在起点上，也就是要最初获取的时候必须是正当的。第二，“转让正义”，如果财产从一个人转义到另一个人手里，整个过程没有巧取豪夺，是用过自由自愿的交换或者馈赠，那转让就是正当的。第三，“矫正正义”，对那些通过不正当的方式得到的财产持有，不管经历多少变化，都必须予以矫正。</li>\n<li>诺齐克心目中理想的国家形态，是一种“最小国家”。这样的国家行使的功能非常有限：只要保障个体公民的基本自由和安全，以及确保合法契约的执行，就不应当再有其他功能。对于个人之间自由自愿的交易活动，政府也无权干预。</li>\n<li>诺齐克的是一种“历史正义”理论，只要财产的来路清白，无论多寡都是正义的。罗尔斯的是一种“模式正义”理论，就是社会经济的分配必须满足某种结构模式。</li>\n<li>罗纳德·德沃金提出：平等的尊重、平等的关怀。要实现“平等的关怀”，首先要识别哪些需求是自己不能选择的处境造成的，哪些是个人自愿选择的偏好造成的。对于前一种情况，应当弥补处境造成的差别，而对于后一种情况，应当接受选择造成的差异。这就是他和罗尔斯的差异。</li>\n<li>迈克尔·桑德尔看来，自由主义的个人观，把个人看作是孤立的原子，完全借自己的自由意志来行动，他称之为“无牵挂的个人”。这是错误的，是对社会的错误理解。自由主义，比如诺齐克往往倾向于“工具性的社群观”，就是认为社群只有工具性的意义。罗尔斯主张“情感性的社群观”，认为社会是一个合作互惠的体系，人们在合作中会产生善意和情感，建立共同的价值。但桑德尔认为，这样的社群没有真正的依赖，也没有形成真正的团结。比如，恋人之间也有感情，该分手还是会分手。桑德尔提出“构成性的社群”：社群是“构成性的”，社群实际上“构成”了你这个人。个人当然会做出选择，但个人的目标并不是随意选择的，而是与社群紧密联系在一起的。社群是一种纽带关系，它在根本上定义了“你是谁”，它塑造了你的身份认同、生活理想、道德感和责任意识。</li>\n<li>迈克尔·沃尔泽指出，社群主义对自由主义的批评有两个要点：第一，自由主义的理论是虚假的，现实中根本不存在这种无所牵挂的原子化个人；第二，自由主义的实践是有害的，造成了自我中心、相互分裂的冷漠社会。沃尔泽认为，自由主义的理论真实反应了现实，所谓“孤立的自我”确实存在。他们并不是脱离社会的存在，个人确实是被社会塑造的，社群主义的这个观点没有错。但是，社群主义没有看到现代社会已经改变了。现代社会一个突出的特点就是高度的“流动性”，总是在移动和变化。第一，“地理上的流动”。第二，“社会身份的流动”，比如过往“子承父业”的传统越老越难以维系。第三，“婚姻关系的流动”。第四，“政治的流动”。现代社会中的社群改变成了“自愿型的社群”。由于前面所说的四种流动性始终存在，现代社会永远都处于运动之中，沃尔泽把这种特征称为“后社会的状况”。那种孤立的、近乎原子的自我，就并不是自由主义虚构出来的“先于社会的自我”观念，而是“后社会状况”造成的。沃尔泽称之为“后社会的自我”观念。这种自我观念反映了自由流动社会的现实，它从根本上失去了确定性和统一性，个人不得不随时重新创造自己。</li>\n<li>从集体主义到个人主义的转向，并不是东西方文明的差别，而是古今之变所致。</li>\n<li>查尔斯·泰勒认为，自我无法凭空创造发明自己的价值和意义标准。自由选择和价值判断需要依据价值尺度，而价值尺度不可能由“自我”来发明创造，我们只能“选用”和“改造”价值尺度，这正是泰勒的社群主义观点带来的启发：个人自主性的来源不可能是“唯我论”的独白，而只能来自关系性的对话。</li>\n<li>本真性的理想，一方面让我们忠实于自己的内心感受，一方面要求我们不要陷入唯我论的独白，积极地介入对话和反思，这是自我通过共同背景的通道，把我们和一个更开阔的世界联系在一起。最终，向对话和反思开放，让我变得更加清醒、更加丰富，才能更好地“成为自己”。</li>\n<li>如果人类所有的活动都发生在人与人之间，那么主体和主体之间就会形成一种关系，尤尔根·哈贝马斯称之为“主体间性”。人类是语言动物，所以人不是独自的存在，而是在人间交往对话的存在。语言交流，互相交往是我们所行动的共同基础。可以用“在人间”三个字概括。哈贝马斯区分了几种言谈行动。一是“策略行动”，你的言谈只是要达到特定的功利性目标。一是“交往行动”，是为了真正理解彼此而展开的对话交谈。哈贝马斯提出“交往理性”，交往理性从来不是一个人的道理，而是大家一起来把道理讲通。这不并不是简单的乌托邦，而是认为交往理性为我们的生活确立了理性规范的原则基础，以此在“生活世界”来抵御“系统的殖民”。</li>\n</ol>\n<h1

id=\"第四章-自由主义及其批判者\">第四章 自由主义及其批判者</h1>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>自由主义有着丰富的内在多样性，多样性造就了它的一个特点：某种自由主义的没落甚至消失，不会牵连自由主义思想整体的命运。</li>\n<li>约翰·罗尔斯，20世界最伟大的政治哲学家，在1971年发表的《正义论》的开篇中说“正义是社会制度的首要价值，正像真理是思想体系的首要价值一样”。罗尔斯通过无知之幕的思想实验，推理论证了一个正义的社会契约中最关键的两条原则。第一条原则是要保障平等的基本自由，第二条原则是，社会经济的不平等分配，必须满足两个限定条件，一个是“公平的机会平等”，一个是要满足差异原则。</li>\n<li>无知之幕，就是一个人站在无知之幕后面，屏蔽一切的个人特征，只保留理性能力，然后签订契约来做出分配，然后你自己再从这里出来获得是随机分配的结果，为了避免自己拿到最大的分配结果，你就需要尽可能做到公平公正。</li>\n<li>在罗伯特·诺齐克看来，罗尔斯在政治权利方面坚持了自由主义原则，让每个人享有基本自由，但在社会经济领域，却没有一以贯之地坚持这个原则，而是把平等分配当作默认选项。罗伯特·诺齐克主张一种完全彻底的自由主义理论，无论是政治领域还是社会经济问题上，都要把个人权利放在最高位置。这种被称为“自由至上论”（也译为“自由放任主义”）。</li>\n<li>诺齐克的论证的关键点，第一，他所有论证的起点是个人权利的绝对优先，对个体权利做出任何限制，都要给出很强的正当理由，方可被接受。第二，他主张在政治、经济和社会等领域全方位地坚持自由原则。尤其在社会经济问题上，他对一种不受任何干预的自由市场资本主义做出了道德辩护。诺齐克讲的正义不是“分配的正义”，而是“持有的正义”。核心问题就是，在什么条件下，我们持有的东西在道德上才是正当的呢？</li>\n<li>诺齐克的论证有一个出发点：我们最初能正当拥有的是什么呢？当然是我们自己，诺齐克称之为“自我所有权”当然仅仅拥有自己是活不下去的，我们还需要获得资源和财产。诺齐克提出了他的三项正义原则，第一，“获取正义”，就是你所持有的财产在起点上，也就是要最初获取的时候必须是正当的。第二，“转让正义”，如果财产从一个人转义到另一个人手里，整个过程没有巧取豪夺，是用过自由自愿的交换或者馈赠，那转让就是正当的。第三，“矫正正义”，对那些通过不正当的方式得到的财产持有，不管经历多少变化，都必须予以矫正。</li>\n<li>诺齐克心目中理想的国家形态，是一种“最小国家”。这样的国家行使的功能非常有限：只要保障个体公民的基本自由和安全，以及确保合法契约的执行，就不应当再有其他功能。对于个人之间自由自愿的交易活动，政府也无权干预。</li>\n<li>诺齐克的是一种“历史正义”理论，只要财产的来路清白，无论多寡都是正义的。罗尔斯的是一种“模式正义”理论，就是社会经济的分配必须满足某种结构模式。</li>\n<li>罗纳德·德沃金提出：平等的尊重、平等的关怀。要实现“平等的关怀”，首先要识别哪些需求是自己不能选择的处境造成的，哪些是个人自愿选择的偏好造成的。对于前一种情况，应当弥补处境造成的差别，而对于后一种情况，应当接受选择造成的差异。这就是他和罗尔斯的差异。</li>\n<li>迈克尔·桑德尔看来，自由主义的个人观，把个人看作是孤立的原子，完全借自己的自由意志来行动，他称之为“无牵挂的个人”。这是错误的，是对社会的错误理解。自由主义，比如诺齐克往往倾向于“工具性的社群观”，就是认为社群只有工具性的意义。罗尔斯主张“情感性的社群观”，认为社会是一个合作互惠的体系，人们在合作中会产生善意和情感，建立共同的价值。但桑德尔认为，这样的社群没有真正的依赖，也没有形成真正的团结。比如，恋人之间也有感情，该分手还是会分手。桑德尔提出“构成性的社群”：社群是“构成性的”，社群实际上“构成”了你这个人。个人当然会做出选择，但个人的目标并不是随意选择的，而是与社群紧密联系在一起的。社群是一种纽带关系，它在根本上定义了“你是谁”，它塑造了你的身份认同、生活理想、道德感和责任意识。</li>\n<li>迈克尔·沃尔泽指出，社群主义对自由主义的批评有两个要点：第一，自由主义的理论是虚假的，现实中根本不存在这种无所牵挂的原子化个人；第二，自由主义的实践是有害的，造成了自我中心、相互分裂的冷漠社会。沃尔泽认为，自由主义的理论真实反应了现实，所谓“孤立的自我”确实存在。他们并不是脱离社会的存在，个人确实是被社会塑造的，社群主义的这个观点没有错。但是，社群主义没有看到现代社会已经改变了。现代社会一个突出的特点就是高度的“流动性”，总是在移动和变化。第一，“地理上的流动”。第二，“社会身份的流动”，比如过往“子承父业”的传统越老越难以维系。第三，“婚姻关系的流动”。第四，“政治的流动”。现代社会中的社群改变成了“自愿型的社群”。由于前面所说的四种流动性始终存在，现代社会永远都处于运动之中，沃尔泽把这种特征称为“后社会的状况”。那种孤立的、近乎原子的自我，就并不是自由主义虚构出来的“先于社会的自我”观念，而是“后社会状况”造成的。沃尔泽称之为“后社会的自我”观念。这种自我观念反映了自由流动社会的现实，它从根本上失去了确定性和统一性，个人不得不随时重新创造自己。</li>\n<li>从集体主义到个人主义的转向，并不是东西方文明的差别，而是古今之变所致。</li>\n<li>查尔斯·泰勒认为，自我无法凭空创造发明自己的价值和意义标准。自由选择和价值判断需要依据价值尺度，而价值尺度不可能由“自我”来发明创造，我们只能“选用”和“改造”价值尺度，这正是泰勒的社群主义观点带来的启发：个人自主性的来源不可能是“唯我论”的独白，而只能来自关系性的对话。</li>\n<li>本真性的理想，一方面让我们忠实于自己的内心感受，一方面要求我们不要陷入唯我论的独白，积极地介入对话和反思，这是自我通过共同背景的通道，把我们和一个更开阔的世界联系在一起。最终，向对话和反思开放，让我变得更加清醒、更加丰富，才能更好地“成为自己”。</li>\n<li>如果人类所有的活动都发生在人与人之间，那么主体和主体之间就会形成一种关系，尤尔根·哈贝马斯称之为“主体间性”。人类是语言动物，所以人不是独自的存在，而是在人间交往对话的存在。语言交流，互相交往是我们所行动的共同基础。可以用“在人间”三个字概括。哈贝马斯区分了几种言谈行动。一是“策略行动”，你的言谈只是要达到特定的功利性目标。一是“交往行动”，是为了真正理解彼此而展开的对话交谈。哈贝马斯提出“交往理性”，交往理性从来不是一个人的道理，而是大家一起来把道理讲通。这不并不是简单的乌托邦，而是认为交往理性为我们的生活确立了理性规范的原则基础，以此在“生活世界”来抵御“系统的殖民”。</li>\n</ol>\n<h1

四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1174\n20 世纪 20 年代的传播思想有个主要特征，那就是不区分面对面的交流和大众传播。“大众媒介”（ mass media ）是一个当时新造的字眼，它构成了一道模糊的地平线。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语  - 位置 1245\n如果更加切实些地表达的话，信息传播（ communication ）是一个能将自然科学（ DNA 为其伟大的密码）、人文科学（“语言即是交流”）和社会科学（传播是基本的社会过程，施拉姆如是说）结为一体的观念。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1270\n罗杰斯认为，良好交流具有的一个主要好处是，它给交谈者以勇气摆脱自己过于情绪化的个人观点，转而重申交流另一方的观点。这正是穆勒在《论自由》（ 1859 ）中提出的人们在公众讨论中应该支持的原则，也是此后在各种传播研讨会上被反复提出的一条具有可操作性的建议。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1280\n到 20 世纪 50 年代，“孤独的个体”（交流不可能）和“受操纵的大众”（交流太强大）这两个幽灵，在传播学文本中又卷土重来，逼视和对抗着二战后的繁荣局面，以及这一繁荣局面的主要代表——电视。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1292\n在 20 世纪 50 年代，人们在思考媒介化世界里的许多人的状况时，确实也提出了一些值得我们关注的观点：所谓“民主的公众（ public ）”可能只是“乌合之众”（ crowd ）；消费主义和娱乐至上窒息了公共参与，以及大众社会理论指出的 5 个“A”现象，即异化（ alienation ）、失范（ anomie ）、匿名（ annonimity ）、冷漠（ apathy ）和原子化（ atomization ）。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1308\n默顿将交流看成是涂尔干式的社会黏合剂；阿伦特认为，它揭示了人与人之间相互联合的政治潜力；列维纳斯则认为，它是对他人自主权的尊重，这一尊重使工具意义上的交流几乎不可能。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1310\n二战后“communication”观念发酵的岁月里，两种话语占据了主导地位：一是信息论的技术话语，一是作为“治疗与疾病”的治疗性话语。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1347\n但是，为什么别人不像我这样使用语词？为什么他们不像我这样看待世界？对这些问题的回答，不是仅通过调节讯息的发射和接收就能解决的，而是要对我们的“集体存在”（ collective being ）进行总体上的重装调配，这是一个在世上如何为彼此留下生存空间的问题。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1360\n在人际交流中，固执地希望交流双方达到互相模仿的境界，可能会走向霸道。在这一点上，爱默生和詹姆斯说到了点子上。他们认为，我们应该承认，与我们分享这个世界的一切生灵都具有美妙的他者特性，而不必悲叹我们无力去发掘它们的内心世界。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > - 位置 1491\n[41] “刻板印象 ”或 “固定的成见 ”（ stereotype），最初专指印刷铅版。1922年李普曼在《公众舆论》一书中将它作为一个学术术语进入到传播学领域。李普曼认为在舆论形成过程中 “刻板印象 ”发挥决定作用。它就像浇铸的铅版一样牢固，并且难以改变。“一旦我们牢固地产生了这种成见，就很难摆脱它。”——译\n\n序论：交流之难题 > - 位置 1516\n[49] 现代主义，通常用来表示欧美第一次世界大战以来被公认为具有独特观点、感受、形式和风格的文学艺术作品，现代主义也被描述为一场文学艺术运动，是现代西方各种文艺思潮和派别的总称，包括19 世纪末叶以至今天仍在演变的欧美资产阶级各国的众多思潮及派别，如象征主义、表现主义、立体主义、未来主义、达达主义、超现实主义、抽象主义、存在主义等等。——译者\n\n 序论：交流之难题 > - 位置 1525\n[52]《存在与时间》，德国存在主义哲学家海德格尔的代表作，存在主义源出于现象学的象征性著作。该书的目的在于追寻 “在 ”的意义，并由此建立所谓 “有 ”的基本本体论。海德格尔认为，世界上唯一的本体的形式是人的存在， “我的存在 ”是本体论的 “存在 ”；只有在极度的苦闷中，才能意识到存在的本身；存在的本质是虚无，人生下来就处于 “烦、畏、死、绝对毁灭之中 ”，人找不到存在的理由，无缘无故被抛到世界上来；人的存在本身是冒险。——译者\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 - 位置 1663\n我们的文化中，许多成分并非一定是两两相对，也并非一定是互惠或互动的。对话仅仅是多种交流脚本中的一种。我们悲叹对话已死，呼吁让对话重新焕发活力，这都忽\n视了非互动的行为以及文化中固有的美好属性。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1721\n苏格拉底清楚明白地阐明了隐藏在 20 世纪人们对交流怀有的担心中那些未能明示的东西：对无法触碰的他者具有的一种强烈渴望。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1734\n口语交流几乎总是以单一事件的方式发生，而且其内容只在关注此事的人中间分享。与此相反，文字则容许各种奇怪的配对：远者影响近者，死人对话活人，许多人阅读本来只给少数人看的东西等等。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1801\n这说明（用媒介）记录内容就意味着放弃对内容的隐私控制权，也就是放弃传播对象的明确性。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1871\n他说，恋人中一方看到另一方时候，就会感觉自己仿佛被淹没在爱河中，感到他浑身毛孔都开始长出羽毛——这羽毛原本就隐藏在其灵魂的原初圣状中，伺机而生。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1903\n黑格尔和马克思确信，人类社会的基本单位由两人组成；一方是另一方通向更高知识的门径，是治疗对天堂的思乡之苦的一剂良药。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1925\n这里产生了一个至今都困扰着我们的两难处境：在一个非个人化的、不忠贞的媒介中，交流一方如何找到确凿的迹象以确保另一方的忠诚和在场。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2059\n《斐德罗篇》中的观点是：要警惕，不要做撒播种子的蠢事，要避免乱交带来的危险；而与此对照，对观福音中的“播种者寓言”则赞扬撒播是一种公平公正的交流形式，它将意义的收获交给接受者的意愿和能力；由传者首先画出的传播轨迹，必须由受者去完成。撒得很多，收得很少，种子不萌芽未必是什么值得哀叹的事情。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2173\n公正不是指给每个人一样的待遇，而是给每个人他应该得到的待遇。同样，爱不只是指个人化和具体化的关爱，而且还要求这种爱是永久稳定和忠诚的，爱是“表情永远固定的面具”。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2181\n传播理论的座右铭应该是：和自我对话，与他者撒播。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2210\n一切礼物馈赠都附加了条件，但是对这个事实的承认却是被禁止的。不承认这个事实，使人能够将关系网中的欠债和还债往后推。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2226\n礼物馈赠既可以加速社会互动，也可以阻止社会互动（由于害怕随礼物而来的义务，人们可能会拒绝收礼）。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2248\n我们都由脆弱的材料做成。对观福音里的寓言劝导我们去拥抱这种脆弱，而不是逃离它。柏拉图的爱欲为 “美 ”所吸引；对观福音中的爱却是因 “需求 ”而驱动。有时候，如在 “善良的撒玛利亚人 ”（ Good Samaritan）寓言里，爱甚至是受厌恶和污秽的驱动的，因为寓言中那个受伤垂死的人躺在路边，活像一具死尸。[72]在苏格拉底的想象中，吸引施爱者的是被爱者身上最永恒、最美妙的东西；而对观福音中的施爱者则如被施了魔咒一样地执著于被爱者身上最脆弱、最不完美的东西。这里的根本的问题是：典型的爱应该是两个平等的人之间身心具在的爱呢，抑或应该是存在于差异巨大的双方之间的跨越鸿沟的爱。如果是第一种情况，那么，交流就应该被设想为一种朝着 “实现恋爱双方交融一体 ”方向作出的腾空一跃；如果是后者，那么，交流就应该被理解为一种在我们和他者身上拾掇一些能找到的碎片，因陋就简的凑合。对观福音中所提及的人类个体——那些为痛苦和强制所困扰的个体——在古典时期的希腊人眼中，奇怪而陌生。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2266\n爱是产生于对肉体的超越呢，还是产生于和肉体的接触？我们应该把交流看成是完美的接触呢，还是看成正因其不完美所以需要我们展现的耐心？交流的两种模式——对话和撒播——之间的对照，归根到底就是一句话：我们能够在多大程度上宽恕人类的愚蠢。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 - 位置 2474\n直到 19 世纪后半叶，“交流”才获得了新的意思，即两个灵魂之间的非物质性接触。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 - 位置 2488\n语言和符号仅仅是我们内在生活的粗糙外在载体。语词最多也就是因约定俗成而存在；它们“指示”存在于人脑中的意义，也“指示”外在世界中的客体。我们在表达自己思想的时候，将自己内心私密的东西托付给公共符号这样的“代理”（ proxies ）。其他人在与我们交流时，得到的也仅仅是这些“代理”，而不是我们在表达内心时具有的非常丰富的原意。因此，我们说出的每一句话都要么在符号交通的十字路口处趔趄摔倒，要么是径直穿越它，因而这个十字路口总是充满着互撞和堵塞。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 > 一、“交流”观念的基督教根源 - 位置 2635\n我们在说话时，让心里的思想通过听者的耳朵进入他心里，我们让我们心里的词语成为外在的声音，这就叫言语（ speech）。然而，我们的思想不会在声音中消失，而是仍然保持完整；它采用了言语的形式，可是它的性质在这个过程中并没有改变。同样道理，我们可以说：道（ Divine Word）虽然变成了肉身——但它的性质并没有发生变化——这样上帝就可以居住在我们之中。——奥古斯丁\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 > 一、“交流”观念的基督教根源 - 位置 2673\n在奥古斯丁看来，词语是同时指向外部现实与内部现实的标记，其关键作用是揭示内心世界，即思想和精神的世界。正如肉体是包裹人的外壳，语词也是包裹思想的外壳。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 > 二、洛克：“交流”之意义从物质到精神的转变 - 位置 2864\n在历史上，“交流”一词主要指的是两个东西：传输的物理过程和形而上学的同体过程（ consubstantiation ）。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 > 二、洛克：“交流”之意义从物质到精神的转变 - 位置 2909\n洛克将知识的基础建立在个体的感知上，这使得人与人之间的知识共享成为一个极大的困难。知识被视作是孤立隔绝的，其他人无法接触，仅局限于我们个人的感觉器官。“共同 ”（或公共）和 “私人 ”之间的区分，既是洛克财产思想的基础，也是他交流思想的基础。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 >  三、“心灵融合”交流观之社会影响：19世纪的催眠术和招魂术 - 位置 3491\n总而言之，在现代的交流思想史上，曾出现过一长串的不同观念，它们均认为人类的交流可以不需要媒介，不需要额外解读。\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4026\n奥古斯丁认为，我们不过是这个世界的匆匆过客，我们在此世的经历，恰如影视剧背景中的群众演员，只要可能，我们便可以尽量忽视；黑格尔则与奥古斯丁不同，他认为我们不能将手段和目的分离。知识之路需要我们一一走过，脚踏实地去全部完成，试图走捷径就会导致我们丧失智慧。\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4055\n通过“主奴戏”比喻，黑格尔想表达的观点是：没有他者就没有自我。正如黑格尔所言，“只有在彼自我意识中，此自我意识才能够满意。”\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4076\n如果一个具备常识的人会诉求于他的感觉，或诉求于他内心的启示，那么他和不同意其意见的人就不会再有任何关系；对与他有不同认识和感觉的人，他只需说，他到此为止，不再表达任何意见，这就行了。但换句话说，他这么做，实际上是践踏了人性（Humanität）之根本，因为人性之本质是要努力和他人求得一致；实际上，人性的本质只存在于已经实现的意识共同体中。——博尔赫斯\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认”  - 位置 4079\n我的“私下的自我”对你是模糊的，但是我的“公开的自我”对我来说也是模糊的。“我即是他者。”\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4096\n黑格尔认为，交流不是一种思想的原状运输，而是我们对自己的生活状态进行的一种组织活动，目的在于让所有的人都能得到相互认可。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 一、记录性媒介vs.传输性媒介 - 位置 4851\n由于这些新媒介的扩散和记录功能，人的主体性讯息比过去得到了更加广泛的传播。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 一、记录性媒介vs.传输性媒介 - 位置 4898\n传输性媒介使我们能够横穿空间，而记录性媒介则使我们能够在时间中纵横穿越。从前对声音、形象和经验的死刑判决现在已经获得减刑。言语和行动可以超越人体之本源而幸存下来。总而言之，记录性媒介使亡灵以新的方式复活再生。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 二、诠释学：一种与死者的交流方式 - 位置 5184\n爱默生的观点是，我们应该对文化（ culture ）与自然（ nature ） [82] 之间的相互关系具有一种敏感，文化给自然留下印记，自然也给文化留下印记。物质不只是泥土，它还能使我们觉察到上帝和他人的存在，能使自我从无休止的漫游中解放出来。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 二、诠释学：一种与死者的交流方式  - 位置 5350\n现代媒介有这样一个效果：即将人的主体性和记忆这些脆弱而缥缈的东西外在化，将其变成一种可以任意回放的永久形态。为了降低这种外在化转换的难度，我们付出的代价就是——将人变成媒体中的幽灵。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 三、死信：无法发出的讯息 - 位置 5441\n“死信处 ”处理的是交流中的物质性，而不是其据说存在的精神性。死信处是为失效的邮件准备的填埋场。存在着死信处这一事实本身就是一个永恒的纪念碑，证明交流绝对逃避不了物质的载体，也证明交流根本就没有什么天使般的、纯粹的符号。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒 - 位置 6090\n布拉德利也具有一种类似实用主义者的敏锐性。他认为，交流总是涉及推断和解读。他虽然认为不同个体的意识是互相隔绝的，但是他并不认为个体就会因此而深陷于这种相互隔绝中不能自拔。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒 - 位置 6135\n“运输是物理的，交流是精神的。”——库利\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒  - 位置 6168\n库利认为，个体的个性人格（ personality）不在别处，而存在于 “我们各自通过面部表情和声音无意识地相互交流的内容 ”之中。个体发出的能指（ signifiers）包括 “幽灵般的表达 ”，比如面部表情和声音的粒质（ grain）等等。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 二、是欺骗还是接触？詹姆斯论灵异研究 - 位置 6227\n康德曾提出三个假设——自然法则、意志自由和灵魂不朽——并认为这三个法则的成立虽然无法证明，但都是理性的和道德的生活所必需的。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 二、是欺骗还是接触？詹姆斯论灵异研究 - 位置 6232\n康德同时认为人无法从自己的认知循环里跳出来。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6405\n在早期的电话文化中，人们谋求的是一种可以不需要 “在场提示 ”（ cues）的交往模式。[68]电话既可以构成感官的障碍（交流双方不可见），也可以是感知的延伸（作为助听器和扩音器）。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6535\n我们的周围充满着各种符号，它们语焉不详，我们该如何去解读它们？我们犹豫不决，进退两难。一方面害怕染上偏执狂，认为 “一切都是信息 ”；另一方面，如果不认为 “一切都是信息 ”，我们就可能会漏掉上帝发给我们的启示。某个符号，它到底是我们的自我投射，还是他者的表达；是我们主观解读产生的结果，还是客观世界显现出来的规律，我们无法确定。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6553\n在过去的二三十年间，文学理论界提出了这样一个问题：谁是意义的主人？意义产生于读者的创造、作者的意图、文本本身、解读者圈子、公认的经典原则，还是读者和文本之间的互动？或者说，谁都不能成为意义的主人，所有的意义都只能被 “租用 ”而不能被 “拥有 ”？\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6577\n无休无止的泣诉，偶尔夹杂些罕见的真相，如荒野中的呼唤——这就是许多现代传播的所遵循的公式，\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6763\n广播公司很快就意识到这一点。为了弥补广播节目中的“不在场感”，他们想出了各种各样的办法，如在现场设置“伙伴听众”，增加和强化播音的交谈特征，以及让播音员使用个性化的语气等等。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6815\n广播听众具有鲜明的特征，他们是彼此间存在着共同联系的群体（ consociate ），而不是简单相加的群体（ congregate ），或者说，广播听众不是基于地域，而是基于想象的共同体。肯特里尔和奥尔波特的研究预示了后来“想象的共同体”。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6878\n媒介是人体的延伸\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6916\n阿多诺的受众观则更加细腻。他认为，广播的危险不在于它能够煽动乌合之众，而是在于它具有的个性化的能力，它能够将听众塞进毫无反思的安稳蚕茧中或虐待狂般的狂笑中。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6978\n人类的一切行动都是建立在某种策略性的虚假期望基础之上的，尽管破除某些不切实际的虚假期望对我们而言是有益的，但只要这种破除不损害我们的动物性信仰，抱有某些虚假期望对我们还是有好处的。如果非要确定阿多诺和默顿谁是谁非，也许我们得先回答另外一个问题：我们是更害怕被权力欺骗呢，还是更害怕被剥夺期望？\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6993\n人们在谈论今天的因特网时，一方面总是对新“政治性身体”——即参与性民主——充满美好梦想；另一方面我们又到处可以听到对“新色情人体”（ new bodies pornographic ）——即儿童沦为色魔的猎物——的噩梦般的担忧。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6997\n如果说，在过去，交流的成功是一门“跨越鸿沟去触摸”的艺术，是为了克服中介性的身体去触摸另一个人的灵魂的话；那么到了电子媒介时代，同样作为一门艺术，交流的成功就变成了跨越中介性的灵魂去触摸另一个人的身体。媒介中的“身体”虽然不是所谓“机器中的幽灵”，却是现代传播媒介中的一个核心的两难。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 - 位置 7399\n“交流”的威力在于它具有克服时空障碍，拓宽人与人之间互动的能力，其动人之处（ pathos ）在于它能超越有限的血肉之躯。交流暗示着无需触摸就可实现联络。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 - 位置 7450\n按照黑格尔的教导，承认他者不是一个简单的感知（ perception）问题，而是一个涉及如何建立人类秩序的问题。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性  - 位置 7456\n阿多诺巧妙地将政治问题和存在问题联系起来，他说：“我们常常遇到这样的断言：‘黑人、野蛮人和日本人是看着像猴子的动物。’这种断言是发生大屠杀的根本原因……人类的‘情感投射’（ pathic projection ）机制决定了，那些掌权的人在看待他人时，不是从他人的独特方面来看待他人，而只是看到了自己形象的折射。”\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 > 一、图灵测试与肉体/爱欲的不可超越性 - 位置 7607\n“人对他者的渴望”\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 > 一、图灵测试与肉体/爱欲的不可超越性 - 位置 7661\n一句话所处的历史语境，决定了我们对其进行解读时的参照范围和共鸣强度\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 > 二、动物及人类对非人生灵的共情 - 位置 7769\n动物行为学的全部目的都是为了寻求一个跨界空间，使得人类在与动物的对话中，能够在后者身上找到人类所想象的自己的另外一半。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 > 三、人类与外星人的交流 - 位置 8037\n究竟是什么原因让我们竟然相信，世间所有的一切如此奇妙，但却并不是智能力量（如上帝）精心设计和传播的结果。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 > 三、人类与外星人的交流 - 位置 8049\n我们不应该被那些试图与外星人交流的努力吓倒，而应该认识到，这种交流并无特殊之处；认识到我们和他者（包括地球上和外太空的一切生物）的会话都是通过符号进行的。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 > 三、人类与外星人的交流 - 位置 8079\n皮尔士和詹姆斯并不赞成“人的内心生活（ inner life ）是心灵主义（ mentalist ）的虚构”这一观点，而是认为，人的内在性常常以他者的面目出现，而且人的内心生活的表现形式多样，分布在我们经验的各个领域；我们最好不要将我们的内心生活看成是由一个由“小矮人”（homunculus ）操纵的控制台，而应将其看成是我们的一种行为，该行为与我们所做的其他一切是彼此连续而非隔离的；我们的内在和外在是同一个莫比乌斯带的两个侧面；我们尊重而不是贬低内心生活的丰富性，认为它是我们众多种复杂行为中的一种，它和我们的其他行为并无明显的差别。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8322\n用对话的碎片思考和说话，这已经成为我们的宿命。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8347\n们往往不愿意承认，日常交流中的一个核心问题，是“沟壑”（ gaps ）的存在，虽然对于这种沟壑，大多数善于使用语言的人都能够进行巧妙的讨价还价。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8352\n将会话视为“两个人通过轮流说话从而逐渐走向对彼此的充分理解”，这种对话观掩盖了两个深层的事实：一方面，无论有多少人参加，一切的话语（ discourse ）都必须要在前一发言和后一发言之间建立联系；另一方面，你的目标受话人也许永远不可能完全等同于你的实际受话人。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 二、接收者拥有的特权 - 位置 8356\n无论“交流”是何意思，交流的中心不应该是自我，而应该是对方。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 二、接收者拥有的特权- 位置 8366\n詹姆斯指出，我们人类的所有知识可能都是建筑在对各种欺骗行为的战略性隐瞒的基础上的；或者说，是建筑在对被某些人视为欺骗行为的战略性隐瞒的基础上的。这些人认为“知识不过是对客观世界的精确拷贝”。但是，判断知识的标准不应该是看它是否精确拷贝了客观世界，而应看它是否能最大限度地帮助我们前行。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 二、接收者拥有的特权 - 位置 8383\n交流不是关于思想运输的社会物理学 [4] ，而是一个充满风险的领域，在其中任何人说话都必须为他从来就无法完美驾驭的东西负责——这个无法完美驾驭的东西，就是说话人的言行在听话人的心灵中产生的作用。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 二、接收者拥有的特权- 位置 8387\n交流的问题并非源于语言的捉摸不定，而是存在于自我和对方之间无法修补的分歧。交流的挑战不是如何做到忠实于我们的内心，而是坚持即使他人不能像我们看待自己那样来看我们，我们仍然能做到宽恕待人。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 三、交流的阴暗面 - 位置 8403\n交流是一种没有保证的冒险。凭借符号去建立联系的任何尝试，都是一场赌博，无论其发生的规模是大还是小。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 三、交流的阴暗面  - 位置 8442\n黑格尔和马克思、杜威和米德、阿多诺和哈贝马斯等思想家都认为，公正的（ just ）交流是健全社会的一个标志。我们应该少去操心符号是否会催生不同的意义，而更应该去操心是哪些因素让我们不能去关爱我们的邻居和那些与我们不同的存在物。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置 8464\n如果我们认为交流是真实思想的结合，那就是低估了身体的神圣。虽然这个时代技术已经可以充分地模拟人体，但身体是否真正在场仍然具有重要意义。触觉是人类最古老的感官，也许是最难以伪造的感官。这就是说，在同等情况下，互相关心的人会尽量到场见面\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置 8474\n触摸和时间，这两个我们可以共享但不能够复制和再生的东西，是我们真诚的惟一保证。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置 8490\n爱之悖论是，边界的具体性和要求的普遍性之间存在着矛盾。由于我们只能够和一些人而不是所有人共度时光，只能够接触一些人而不是所有人，因此，亲临而在场恐怕是我们能做到的最接近跨越人与人之间鸿沟的保证。在这一点上，我们直接面对的是我们的有限性，它既神圣又悲哀。\n","source":"_posts/《对空言说：传播的观念史》摘抄.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

一、“交流”的历史性 - 位置 772\n我们每一个人都把字宙分为两半。几乎每一个人的兴趣都附着在这两半之一上。只不过，不同的人把这个分界线划在不同的地方。但尽管如此，我们大家给这两半各自的命名却是一样的，都叫“我”和“非我”。我这样说的时候，言下之意立刻就清楚明白了。在上帝创造的万物之中，每个人的心灵特别感兴趣的东西——可以称为“我”或“我的”东西——可能是一个道德谜团，然而这是一个根本的心理事实……我们每个人都在不同的地方去分割宇宙。\n\n序论：交流之难题

816\n交流是一种补偿性的理想，其力量源于它与交流失败和交流故障之间的对照和反差。交流失败固然令人羞愧，但它正是推动交流观念形成的第一力量。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 二、“交流”的多义性 - 位置 849\n“Communication”还有连接（ connection ）或链接（ linkage ）的意思。Communication的第二个主要的意思是指迁移、传输或发射。Communication的第三个主要意思是 “交换 ”，即一个涉及两次迁移的过程。Communication还可以在更加收敛的意义上作为一个高度概括的词，用来指涉各种各样的符号互动（ interaction）[23]，这是它具有的第四个意思。communication 也含有和“逻各斯”类似的广泛意义。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 三、20世纪20年代：传播学的论争 - 位置 965\n这两个敌人也就是 20 世纪 20 年代的两种经典的焦虑：前者认为外部信息难以企及个体内心，后者则认为大众容易上当受骗（这些关切恰恰折射出唯我论 / 传心术的二元区分）。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 三、20世纪20年代：传播学的论争 - 位置 968\n人类交流中许多问题根源于对语言的象征功能和情感功能的混淆。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 三、20世纪20年代：传播学的论争 - 位置 1003\n如果意义不是蕴藏在语词里，而是在传播者脑子里或是在对客体的指称里，那么，任何东西都无法确保意义能跨越两个心灵而实现成功迁移。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 三、20世纪20年代：传播学的论争 - 位置 1009\n交流是无法逾越的障碍。宣传分析是随着社会和政治现代化的出现而出现的。对“交流不可能”的认识，正是现代主义文学和美学思潮的核心。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 三、20世纪20年代：传播学的论争 - 位置 1051\n与人共同存在（ being ）对我们的生存（ existence ）而言是基本的。我们要成为人，就必须是语言的和社会的。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 三、20世纪20年代：传播学的论争 - 位置 1112\n杜威认为，一个时代最突出的异化特征，莫过于参与性互动的缺失或扭曲。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 三、20世纪20年代：传播学的论争 - 位置 1119\n总而言之， 20世纪 20年代，总共有五种显而易见但互相缠绕的传播视野：交流是对公共舆论的管理；交流是对语义之雾的消除；交流是从自我城堡中进行的徒劳的突围；交流是对他者特性的揭示；交流是对行动的协调。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 三、20世纪20年代：传播学的论争 - 位置 1153\n如果将交流当作自我（或自我的思想）在他人身上的复制，那么它就理应崩溃，因为这样去理解交流，实质上是对人的独特性的大屠杀（ pogrom ）。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 三、20世纪20年代：传播学的论争 - 位置 1165\n语言对我们的意图有抗拒性，用海德格尔的话来说，不是我们说语言，而是语言说我们；不过，语言又是我们所知道的最可靠的劝说手段。不错，语言是一个黑箱，里面承载的内容，未必如我（能言说的自我）所想的那样，然而，大多数时候它还是能够协调我们的行动。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1174\n20 世纪 20 年代的传播思想有个主要特征，那就是不区分面对面的交流和大众传播。“大众媒介”（ mass media ）是一个当时新造的字眼，它构成了一道模糊的地平线。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语  - 位置 1245\n如果更加切实些地表达的话，信息传播（ communication ）是一个能将自然科学（ DNA 为其伟大的密码）、人文科学（“语言即是交流”）和社会科学（传播是基本的社会过程，施拉姆如是说）结为一体的观念。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1270\n罗杰斯认为，良好交流具有的一个主要好处是，它给交谈者以勇气摆脱自己过于情绪化的个人观点，转而重申交流另一方的观点。这正是穆勒在《论自由》（ 1859 ）中提出的人们在公众讨论中应该支持的原则，也是此后在各种传播研讨会上被反复提出的一条具有可操作性的建议。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1280\n到 20 世纪 50 年代，“孤独的个体”（交流不可能）和“受操纵的大众”（交流太强大）这两个幽灵，在传播学文本中又卷土重来，逼视和对抗着二战后的繁荣局面，以及这一繁荣局面的主要代表——电视。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1292\n在 20 世纪 50 年代，人们在思考媒介化世界里的许多人的状况时，确实也提出了一些值得我们关注的观点：所谓“民主的公众（ public ）”可能只是“乌合之众”（ crowd ）；消费主义和娱乐至上窒息了公共参与，以及大众社会理论指出的 5 个“A”现象，即异化（ alienation ）、失范（ anomie ）、匿名（ annonimity ）、冷漠（ apathy ）和原子化（ atomization ）。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1308\n默顿将交流看成是涂尔干式的社会黏合剂；阿伦特认为，它揭示了人与人之间相互联合的政治潜力；列维纳斯则认为，它是对他人自主权的尊重，这一尊重使工具意义上的交流几乎不可能。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1310\n二战后“communication”观念发酵的岁月里，两种话语占据了主导地位：一是信息论的技术话语，一是作为“治疗与疾病”的治疗性话语。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1347\n但是，为什么别人不像我这样使用语词？为什么他们不像我这样看待世界？对这些问题的回答，不是仅通过调节讯息的发射和接收就能解决的，而是要对我们的“集体存在”（ collective being ）进行总体上的重装调配，这是一个在世上如何为彼此留下生存空间的问题。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > 四、二战以来“交流”的技术性话语和治疗性话语 - 位置 1360\n在人际交流中，固执地希望交流双方达到互相模仿的境界，可能会走向霸道。在这一点上，爱默生和詹姆斯说到了点子上。他们认为，我们应该承认，与我们分享这个世界的一切生灵都具有美妙的他者特性，而不必悲叹我们无力去发掘它们的内心世界。\n\n序论：交流之难题 > - 位置 1491\n[41] “刻板印象 ”或 “固定的成见 ”（ stereotype），最初专指印刷铅版。1922年李普曼在《公众舆论》一书中将它作为一个学术术语进入到传播学领域。李普曼认为在舆论形成过程中 “刻板印象 ”发挥决定作用。它就像浇铸的铅版一样牢固，并且难以改变。“一旦我们牢固地产生了这种成见，就很难摆脱它。”——译\n\n序论：交流之难题 > - 位置 1516\n[49] 现代主义，通常用来表示欧美第一次世界大战以来被公认为具有独特观点、感受、形式和风格的文学艺术作品，现代主义也被描述为一场文学艺术运动，是现代西方各种文艺思潮和派别的总称，包括19 世纪末叶以至今天仍在演变的欧美资产阶级各国的众多思潮及派别，如象征主义、表现主义、立体主义、未来主义、达达主义、超现实主义、抽象主义、存在主义等等。——译者\n\n 序论：交流之难题 > - 位置 1525\n[52]《存在与时间》，德国存在主义哲学家海德格尔的代表作，存在主义源出于现象学的象征性著作。该书的目的在于追寻 “在 ”的意义，并由此建立所谓 “有 ”的基本本体论。海德格尔认为，世界上唯一的本体的形式是人的存在， “我的存在 ”是本体论的 “存在 ”；只有在极度的苦闷中，才能意识到存在的本身；存在的本质是虚无，人生下来就处于 “烦、畏、死、绝对毁灭之中 ”，人找不到存在的理由，无缘无故被抛到世界上来；人的存在本身是冒险。——译者\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 - 位置 1663\n我们的文化中，许多成分并非一定是两两相对，也并非一定是互惠或互动的。对话仅仅是多种交流脚本中的一种。我们悲叹对话已死，呼吁让对话重新焕发活力，这都忽\n视了非互动的行为以及文化中固有的美好属性。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1721\n苏格拉底清楚明白地阐明了隐藏在 20 世纪人们对交流怀有的担心中那些未能明示的东西：对无法触碰的他者具有的一种强烈渴望。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1734\n口语交流几乎总是以单一事件的方式发生，而且其内容只在关注此事的人中间分享。与此相反，文字则容许各种奇怪的配对：远者影响近者，死人对话活人，许多人阅读本来只给少数人看的东西等等。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1801\n这说明（用媒介）记录内容就意味着放弃对内容的隐私控制权，也就是放弃传播对象的明确性。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1871\n他说，恋人中一方看到另一方时候，就会感觉自己仿佛被淹没在爱河中，感到他浑身毛孔都开始长出羽毛——这羽毛原本就隐藏在其灵魂的原初圣状中，伺机而生。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1903\n黑格尔和马克思确信，人类社会的基本单位由两人组成；一方是另一方通向更高知识的门径，是治疗对天堂的思乡之苦的一剂良药。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 一、《斐德罗篇》中的对话和爱欲 - 位置 1925\n这里产生了一个至今都困扰着我们的两难处境：在一个非个人化的、不忠贞的媒介中，交流一方如何找到确凿的迹象以确保另一方的忠诚和在场。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2059\n《斐德罗篇》中的观点是：要警惕，不要做撒播种子的蠢事，要避免乱交带来的危险；而与此对照，对观福音中的“播种者寓言”则赞扬撒播是一种公平公正的交流形式，它将意义的收获交给接受者的意愿和能力；由传者首先画出的传播轨迹，必须由受者去完成。撒得很多，收得很少，种子不萌芽未必是什么值得哀叹的事情。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2173\n公正不是指给每个人一样的待遇，而是给每个人他应该得到的待遇。同样，爱不只是指个人化和具体化的关爱，而且还要求这种爱是永久稳定和忠诚的，爱是“表情永远固定的面具”。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2181\n传播理论的座右铭应该是：和自我对话，与他者撒播。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2210\n一切礼物馈赠都附加了条件，但是对这个事实的承认却是被禁止的。不承认这个事实，使人能够将关系网中的欠债和还债往后推。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2226\n礼物馈赠既可以加速社会互动，也可以阻止社会互动（由于害怕随礼物而来的义务，人们可能会拒绝收礼）。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2248\n我们都由脆弱的材料做成。对观福音里的寓言劝导我们去拥抱这种脆弱，而不是逃离它。柏拉图的爱欲为 “美 ”所吸引；对观福音中的爱却是因 “需求 ”而驱动。有时候，如在 “善良的撒玛利亚人 ”（ Good Samaritan）寓言里，爱甚至是受厌恶和污秽的驱动的，因为寓言中那个受伤垂死的人躺在路边，活像一具死尸。[72]在苏格拉底的想象中，吸引施爱者的是被爱者身上最永恒、最美妙的东西；而对观福音中的施爱者则如被施了魔咒一样地执著于被爱者身上最脆弱、最不完美的东西。这里的根本的问题是：典型的爱应该是两个平等的人之间身心具在的爱呢，抑或应该是存在于差异巨大的双方之间的跨越鸿沟的爱。如果是第一种情况，那么，交流就应该被设想为一种朝着 “实现恋爱双方交融一体 ”方向作出的腾空一跃；如果是后者，那么，交流就应该被理解为一种在我们和他者身上拾掇一些能找到的碎片，因陋就简的凑合。对观福音中所提及的人类个体——那些为痛苦和强制所困扰的个体——在古典时期的希腊人眼中，奇怪而陌生。\n\n第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 > 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2266\n爱是产生于对肉体的超越呢，还是产生于和肉体的接触？我们应该把交流看成是完美的接触呢，还是看成正因其不完美所以需要我们展现的耐心？交流的两种模式——对话和撒播——之间的对照，归根到底就是一句话：我们能够在多大程度上宽恕人类的愚蠢。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 - 位置 2474\n直到 19 世纪后半叶，“交流”才获得了新的意思，即两个灵魂之间的非物质性接触。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 - 位置 2488\n语言和符号仅仅是我们内在生活的粗糙外在载体。语词最多也就是因约定俗成而存在；它们“指示”存在于人脑中的意义，也“指示”外在世界中的客体。我们在表达自己思想的时候，将自己内心私密的东西托付给公共符号这样的“代理”（ proxies ）。其他人在与我们交流时，得到的也仅仅是这些“代理”，而不是我们在表达内心时具有的非常丰富的原意。因此，我们说出的每一句话都要么在符号交通的十字路口处趔趄摔倒，要么是径直穿越它，因而这个十字路口总是充满着互撞和堵塞。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 > 一、“交流”观念的基督教根源 - 位置 2635\n我们在说话时，让心里的思想通过听者的耳朵进入他心里，我们让我们心里的词语成为外在的声音，这就叫言语（ speech）。然而，我们的思想不会在声音中消失，而是仍然保持完整；它采用了言语的形式，可是它的性质在这个过程中并没有改变。同样道理，我们可以说：道（ Divine Word）虽然变成了肉身——但它的性质并没有发生变化——这样上帝就可以居住在我们之中。——奥古斯丁\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 > 一、“交流”观念的基督教根源 - 位置 2673\n在奥古斯丁看来，词语是同时指向外部现实与内部现实的标记，其关键作用是揭示内心世界，即思想和精神的世界。正如肉体是包裹人的外壳，语词也是包裹思想的外壳。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 > 二、洛克：“交流”之意义从物质到精神的转变 - 位置 2864\n在历史上，“交流”一词主要指的是两个东西：传输的物理过程和形而上学的同体过程（ consubstantiation ）。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 > 二、洛克：“交流”之意义从物质到精神的转变 - 位置 2909\n洛克将知识的基础建立在个体的感知上，这使得人与人之间的知识共享成为一个极大的困难。知识被视作是孤立隔绝的，其他人无法接触，仅局限于我们个人的感觉器官。“共同 ”（或公共）和 “私人 ”之间的区分，既是洛克财产思想的基础，也是他交流思想的基础。\n\n第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 >  三、“心灵融合”交流观之社会影响：19世纪的催眠术和招魂术 - 位置 3491\n总而言之，在现代的交流思想史上，曾出现过一长串的不同观念，它们均认为人类的交流可以不需要媒介，不需要额外解读。\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4026\n奥古斯丁认为，我们不过是这个世界的匆匆过客，我们在此世的经历，恰如影视剧背景中的群众演员，只要可能，我们便可以尽量忽视；黑格尔则与奥古斯丁不同，他认为我们不能将手段和目的分离。知识之路需要我们一一走过，脚踏实地去全部完成，试图走捷径就会导致我们丧失智慧。\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4055\n通过“主奴戏”比喻，黑格尔想表达的观点是：没有他者就没有自我。正如黑格尔所言，“只有在彼自我意识中，此自我意识才能够满意。”\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4076\n如果一个具备常识的人会诉求于他的感觉，或诉求于他内心的启示，那么他和不同意其意见的人就不会再有任何关系；对与他有不同认识和感觉的人，他只需说，他到此为止，不再表达任何意见，这就行了。但换句话说，他这么做，实际上是践踏了人性（Humanität）之根本，因为人性之本质是要努力和他人求得一致；实际上，人性的本质只存在于已经实现的意识共同体中。——博尔赫斯\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认”  - 位置 4079\n我的“私下的自我”对你是模糊的，但是我的“公开的自我”对我来说也是模糊的。“我即是他者。”\n\n第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 > 一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4096\n黑格尔认为，交流不是一种思想的原状运输，而是我们对自己的生活状态进行的一种组织活动，目的在于让所有的人都能得到相互认可。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 一、记录性媒介vs.传输性媒介 - 位置 4851\n由于这些新媒介的扩散和记录功能，人的主体性讯息比过去得到了更加广泛的传播。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 一、记录性媒介vs.传输性媒介 - 位置 4898\n传输性媒介使我们能够横穿空间，而记录性媒介则使我们能够在时间中纵横穿越。从前对声音、形象和经验的死刑判决现在已经获得减刑。言语和行动可以超越人体之本源而幸存下来。总而言之，记录性媒介使亡灵以新的方式复活再生。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 二、诠释学：一种与死者的交流方式 - 位置 5184\n爱默生的观点是，我们应该对文化（ culture ）与自然（ nature ） [82] 之间的相互关系具有一种敏感，文化给自然留下印记，自然也给文化留下印记。物质不只是泥土，它还能使我们觉察到上帝和他人的存在，能使自我从无休止的漫游中解放出来。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 二、诠释学：一种与死者的交流方式  - 位置 5350\n现代媒介有这样一个效果：即将人的主体性和记忆这些脆弱而缥缈的东西外在化，将其变成一种可以任意回放的永久形态。为了降低这种外在化转换的难度，我们付出的代价就是——将人变成媒体中的幽灵。\n\n第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 > 三、死信：无法发出的讯息 - 位置 5441\n“死信处 ”处理的是交流中的物质性，而不是其据说存在的精神性。死信处是为失效的邮件准备的填埋场。存在着死信处这一事实本身就是一个永恒的纪念碑，证明交流绝对逃避不了物质的载体，也证明交流根本就没有什么天使般的、纯粹的符号。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒 - 位置 6090\n布拉德利也具有一种类似实用主义者的敏锐性。他认为，交流总是涉及推断和解读。他虽然认为不同个体的意识是互相隔绝的，但是他并不认为个体就会因此而深陷于这种相互隔绝中不能自拔。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒 - 位置 6135\n“运输是物理的，交流是精神的。”——库利\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒  - 位置 6168\n库利认为，个体的个性人格（ personality）不在别处，而存在于 “我们各自通过面部表情和声音无意识地相互交流的内容 ”之中。个体发出的能指（ signifiers）包括 “幽灵般的表达 ”，比如面部表情和声音的粒质（ grain）等等。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 二、是欺骗还是接触？詹姆斯论灵异研究 - 位置 6227\n康德曾提出三个假设——自然法则、意志自由和灵魂不朽——并认为这三个法则的成立虽然无法证明，但都是理性的和道德的生活所必需的。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 二、是欺骗还是接触？詹姆斯论灵异研究 - 位置 6232\n康德同时认为人无法从自己的认知循环里跳出来。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6405\n在早期的电话文化中，人们谋求的是一种可以不需要 “在场提示 ”（ cues）的交往模式。[68]电话既可以构成感官的障碍（交流双方不可见），也可以是感知的延伸（作为助听器和扩音器）。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6535\n我们的周围充满着各种符号，它们语焉不详，我们该如何去解读它们？我们犹豫不决，进退两难。一方面害怕染上偏执狂，认为 “一切都是信息 ”；另一方面，如果不认为 “一切都是信息 ”，我们就可能会漏掉上帝发给我们的启示。某个符号，它到底是我们的自我投射，还是他者的表达；是我们主观解读产生的结果，还是客观世界显现出来的规律，我们无法确定。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6553\n在过去的二三十年间，文学理论界提出了这样一个问题：谁是意义的主人？意义产生于读者的创造、作者的意图、文本本身、解读者圈子、公认的经典原则，还是读者和文本之间的互动？或者说，谁都不能成为意义的主人，所有的意义都只能被 “租用 ”而不能被 “拥有 ”？\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6577\n无休无止的泣诉，偶尔夹杂些罕见的真相，如荒野中的呼唤——这就是许多现代传播的所遵循的公式，\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6763\n广播公司很快就意识到这一点。为了弥补广播节目中的“不在场感”，他们想出了各种各样的办法，如在现场设置“伙伴听众”，增加和强化播音的交谈特征，以及让播音员使用个性化的语气等等。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6815\n广播听众具有鲜明的特征，他们是彼此间存在着共同联系的群体（ consociate ），而不是简单相加的群体（ congregate ），或者说，广播听众不是基于地域，而是基于想象的共同体。肯特里尔和奥尔波特的研究预示了后来“想象的共同体”。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6878\n媒介是人体的延伸\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6916\n阿多诺的受众观则更加细腻。他认为，广播的危险不在于它能够煽动乌合之众，而是在于它具有的个性化的能力，它能够将听众塞进毫无反思的安稳蚕茧中或虐待狂般的狂笑中。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6978\n人类的一切行动都是建立在某种策略性的虚假期望基础之上的，尽管破除某些不切实际的虚假期望对我们而言是有益的，但只要这种破除不损害我们的动物性信仰，抱有某些虚假期望对我们还是有好处的。如果非要确定阿多诺和默顿谁是谁非，也许我们得先回答另外一个问题：我们是更害怕被权力欺骗呢，还是更害怕被剥夺期望？\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6993\n人们在谈论今天的因特网时，一方面总是对新“政治性身体”——即参与性民主——充满美好梦想；另一方面我们又到处可以听到对“新色情人体”（ new bodies pornographic ）——即儿童沦为色魔的猎物——的噩梦般的担忧。\n\n第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？> 四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6997\n如果说，在过去，交流的成功是一门“跨越鸿沟去触摸”的艺术，是为了克服中介性的身体去触摸另一个人的灵魂的话；那么到了电子媒介时代，同样作为一门艺术，交流的成功就变成了跨越中介性的灵魂去触摸另一个人的身体。媒介中的“身体”虽然不是所谓“机器中的幽灵”，却是现代传播媒介中的一个核心的两难。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 - 位置 7399\n“交流”的威力在于它具有克服时空障碍，拓宽人与人之间互动的能力，其动人之处（ pathos ）在于它能超越有限的血肉之躯。交流暗示着无需触摸就可实现联络。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 - 位置 7450\n按照黑格尔的教导，承认他者不是一个简单的感知（ perception）问题，而是一个涉及如何建立人类秩序的问题。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性  - 位置 7456\n阿多诺巧妙地将政治问题和存在问题联系起来，他说：“我们常常遇到这样的断言：‘黑人、野蛮人和日本人是看着像猴子的动物。’这种断言是发生大屠杀的根本原因……人类的‘情感投射’（ pathic projection ）机制决定了，那些掌权的人在看待他人时，不是从他人的独特方面来看待他人，而只是看到了自己形象的折射。”\n\n第六章

三、人类与外星人的交流 - 位置 8049\n我们不应该被那些试图与外星人交流的努力吓倒，而应该认识到，这种交流并无特殊之处；认识到我们和他者（包括地球上和外太空的一切生物）的会话都是通过符号进行的。\n\n第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 > 三、人类与外星人的交流 - 位置 8079\n皮尔士和詹姆斯并不赞成“人的内心生活（ inner life ）是心灵主义（ mentalist ）的虚构”这一观点，而是认为，人的内在性常常以他者的面目出现，而且人的内心生活的表现形式多样，分布在我们经验的各个领域；我们最好不要将我们的内心生活看成是由一个由“小矮人”（homunculus ）操纵的控制台，而应将其看成是我们的一种行为，该行为与我们所做的其他一切是彼此连续而非隔离的；我们的内在和外在是同一个莫比乌斯带的两个侧面；我们尊重而不是贬低内心生活的丰富性，认为它是我们众多种复杂行为中的一种，它和我们的其他行为并无明显的差别。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8322\n用对话的碎片思考和说话，这已经成为我们的宿命。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8347\n们往往不愿意承认，日常交流中的一个核心问题，是“沟壑”（ gaps ）的存在，虽然对于这种沟壑，大多数善于使用语言的人都能够进行巧妙的讨价还价。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8352\n将会话视为“两个人通过轮流说话从而逐渐走向对彼此的充分理解”，这种对话观掩盖了两个深层的事实：一方面，无论有多少人参加，一切的话语（

8366\n詹姆斯指出，我们人类的所有知识可能都是建筑在对各种欺骗行为的战略性隐瞒的基础上的；或者说，是建筑在对被某些人视为欺骗行为的战略性隐瞒的基础上的。这些人认为“知识不过是对客观世界的精确拷贝”。但是，判断知识的标准不应该是看它是否精确拷贝了客观世界，而应看它是否能最大限度地帮助我们前行。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 二、接收者拥有的特权 - 位置 8383\n交流不是关于思想运输的社会物理学 [4] ，而是一个充满风险的领域，在其中任何人说话都必须为他从来就无法完美驾驭的东西负责——这个无法完美驾驭的东西，就是说话人的言行在听话人的心灵中产生的作用。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 二、接收者拥有的特权- 位置 8387\n交流的问题并非源于语言的捉摸不定，而是存在于自我和对方之间无法修补的分歧。交流的挑战不是如何做到忠实于我们的内心，而是坚持即使他人不能像我们看待自己那样来看我们，我们仍然能做到宽恕待人。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 三、交流的阴暗面 - 位置 8403\n交流是一种没有保证的冒险。凭借符号去建立联系的任何尝试，都是一场赌博，无论其发生的规模是大还是小。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 三、交流的阴暗面  - 位置 8442\n黑格尔和马克思、杜威和米德、阿多诺和哈贝马斯等思想家都认为，公正的（ just ）交流是健全社会的一个标志。我们应该少去操心符号是否会催生不同的意义，而更应该去操心是哪些因素让我们不能去关爱我们的邻居和那些与我们不同的存在物。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置 8464\n如果我们认为交流是真实思想的结合，那就是低估了身体的神圣。虽然这个时代技术已经可以充分地模拟人体，但身体是否真正在场仍然具有重要意义。触觉是人类最古老的感官，也许是最难以伪造的感官。这就是说，在同等情况下，互相关心的人会尽量到场见面\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置 8474\n触摸和时间，这两个我们可以共享但不能够复制和再生的东西，是我们真诚的惟一保证。\n\n结语 用手挤呀 > 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置 8490\n爱之悖论是，边界的具体性和要求的普遍性之间存在着矛盾。由于我们只能够和一些人而不是所有人共度时光，只能够接触一些人而不是所有人，因此，亲临而在场恐怕是我们能做到的最接近跨越人与人之间鸿沟的保证。在这一点上，我们直接面对的是我们的有限性，它既神圣又悲哀。\n","slug":"《对空言说：传播的观念史》摘抄","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.501Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vksg003bpmnk1wl7b452","content":"<p>序论：交流之难题

Good\nSamaritan）寓言里，爱甚至是受厌恶和污秽的驱动的，因为寓言中那个受伤垂死的人躺在路边，活像一具死尸。[72]在苏格拉底的想象中，吸引施爱者的是被爱者身上最永恒、最美妙的东西；而对观福音中的施爱者则如被施了魔咒一样地执著于被爱者身上最脆弱、最不完美的东西。这里的根本的问题是：典型的爱应该是两个平等的人之间身心具在的爱呢，抑或应该是存在于差异巨大的双方之间的跨越鸿沟的爱。如果是第一种情况，那么，交流就应该被设想为一种朝着\n“实现恋爱双方交融一体\n”方向作出的腾空一跃；如果是后者，那么，交流就应该被理解为一种在我们和他者身上拾掇一些能找到的碎片，因陋就简的凑合。对观福音中所提及的人类个体——那些为痛苦和强制所困扰的个体——在古典时期的希腊人眼中，奇怪而陌生。</p>\n<p>第一章

一、记录性媒介vs.传输性媒介 -\n位置 4898\n传输性媒介使我们能够横穿空间，而记录性媒介则使我们能够在时间中纵横穿越。从前对声音、形象和经验的死刑判决现在已经获得减刑。言语和行动可以超越人体之本源而幸存下来。总而言之，记录性媒介使亡灵以新的方式复活再生。</p>\n<p>第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 &gt; 二、诠释学：一种与死者的交流方式\n- 位置 5184 爱默生的观点是，我们应该对文化（ culture ）与自然（ nature\n） [82]\n之间的相互关系具有一种敏感，文化给自然留下印记，自然也给文化留下印记。物质不只是泥土，它还能使我们觉察到上帝和他人的存在，能使自我从无休止的漫游中解放出来。</p>\n<p>第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 &gt; 二、诠释学：一种与死者的交流方式\n- 位置 5350\n现代媒介有这样一个效果：即将人的主体性和记忆这些脆弱而缥缈的东西外在化，将其变成一种可以任意回放的永久形态。为了降低这种外在化转换的难度，我们付出的代价就是——将人变成媒体中的幽灵。</p>\n<p>第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 &gt; 三、死信：无法发出的讯息 - 位置\n5441 “死信处\n”处理的是交流中的物质性，而不是其据说存在的精神性。死信处是为失效的邮件准备的填埋场。存在着死信处这一事实本身就是一个永恒的纪念碑，证明交流绝对逃避不了物质的载体，也证明交流根本就没有什么天使般的、纯粹的符号。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒 - 位置

“一切都是信息\n”，我们就可能会漏掉上帝发给我们的启示。某个符号，它到底是我们的自我投射，还是他者的表达；是我们主观解读产生的结果，还是客观世界显现出来的规律，我们无法确定。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6553\n在过去的二三十年间，文学理论界提出了这样一个问题：谁是意义的主人？意义产生于读者的创造、作者的意图、文本本身、解读者圈子、公认的经典原则，还是读者和文本之间的互动？或者说，谁都不能成为意义的主人，所有的意义都只能被\n“租用 ”而不能被 “拥有 ”？</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置

6978\n人类的一切行动都是建立在某种策略性的虚假期望基础之上的，尽管破除某些不切实际的虚假期望对我们而言是有益的，但只要这种破除不损害我们的动物性信仰，抱有某些虚假期望对我们还是有好处的。如果非要确定阿多诺和默顿谁是谁非，也许我们得先回答另外一个问题：我们是更害怕被权力欺骗呢，还是更害怕被剥夺期望？</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6993\n人们在谈论今天的因特网时，一方面总是对新“政治性身体”——即参与性民主——充满美好梦想；另一方面我们又到处可以听到对“新色情人体”（\nnew bodies pornographic ）——即儿童沦为色魔的猎物——的噩梦般的担忧。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6997\n如果说，在过去，交流的成功是一门“跨越鸿沟去触摸”的艺术，是为了克服中介性的身体去触摸另一个人的灵魂的话；那么到了电子媒介时代，同样作为一门艺术，交流的成功就变成了跨越中介性的灵魂去触摸另一个人的身体。媒介中的“身体”虽然不是所谓“机器中的幽灵”，却是现代传播媒介中的一个核心的两难。</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 - 位置

一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8352\n将会话视为“两个人通过轮流说话从而逐渐走向对彼此的充分理解”，这种对话观掩盖了两个深层的事实：一方面，无论有多少人参加，一切的话语（\ndiscourse\n）都必须要在前一发言和后一发言之间建立联系；另一方面，你的目标受话人也许永远不可能完全等同于你的实际受话人。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 二、接收者拥有的特权 - 位置 8356\n无论“交流”是何意思，交流的中心不应该是自我，而应该是对方。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 二、接收者拥有的特权- 位置 8366\n詹姆斯指出，我们人类的所有知识可能都是建筑在对各种欺骗行为的战略性隐瞒的基础上的；或者说，是建筑在对被某些人视为欺骗行为的战略性隐瞒的基础上的。这些人认为“知识不过是对客观世界的精确拷贝”。但是，判断知识的标准不应该是看它是否精确拷贝了客观世界，而应看它是否能最大限度地帮助我们前行。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 二、接收者拥有的特权 - 位置 8383\n交流不是关于思想运输的社会物理学 [4]\n，而是一个充满风险的领域，在其中任何人说话都必须为他从来就无法完美驾驭的东西负责——这个无法完美驾驭的东西，就是说话人的言行在听话人的心灵中产生的作用。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 二、接收者拥有的特权- 位置 8387\n交流的问题并非源于语言的捉摸不定，而是存在于自我和对方之间无法修补的分歧。交流的挑战不是如何做到忠实于我们的内心，而是坚持即使他人不能像我们看待自己那样来看我们，我们仍然能做到宽恕待人。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 三、交流的阴暗面 - 位置

8464\n如果我们认为交流是真实思想的结合，那就是低估了身体的神圣。虽然这个时代技术已经可以充分地模拟人体，但身体是否真正在场仍然具有重要意义。触觉是人类最古老的感官，也许是最难以伪造的感官。这就是说，在同等情况下，互相关心的人会尽量到场见面</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置

2059\n《斐德罗篇》中的观点是：要警惕，不要做撒播种子的蠢事，要避免乱交带来的危险；而与此对照，对观福音中的“播种者寓言”则赞扬撒播是一种公平公正的交流形式，它将意义的收获交给接受者的意愿和能力；由传者首先画出的传播轨迹，必须由受者去完成。撒得很多，收得很少，种子不萌芽未必是什么值得哀叹的事情。</p>\n<p>第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 &gt; 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2173\n公正不是指给每个人一样的待遇，而是给每个人他应该得到的待遇。同样，爱不只是指个人化和具体化的关爱，而且还要求这种爱是永久稳定和忠诚的，爱是“表情永远固定的面具”。</p>\n<p>第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 &gt; 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2181\n传播理论的座右铭应该是：和自我对话，与他者撒播。</p>\n<p>第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 &gt; 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2210\n一切礼物馈赠都附加了条件，但是对这个事实的承认却是被禁止的。不承认这个事实，使人能够将关系网中的欠债和还债往后推。</p>\n<p>第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 &gt; 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2226\n礼物馈赠既可以加速社会互动，也可以阻止社会互动（由于害怕随礼物而来的义务，人们可能会拒绝收礼）。</p>\n<p>第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 &gt; 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2248\n我们都由脆弱的材料做成。对观福音里的寓言劝导我们去拥抱这种脆弱，而不是逃离它。柏拉图的爱欲为\n“美 ”所吸引；对观福音中的爱却是因 “需求 ”而驱动。有时候，如在\n“善良的撒玛利亚人 ”（ Good\nSamaritan）寓言里，爱甚至是受厌恶和污秽的驱动的，因为寓言中那个受伤垂死的人躺在路边，活像一具死尸。[72]在苏格拉底的想象中，吸引施爱者的是被爱者身上最永恒、最美妙的东西；而对观福音中的施爱者则如被施了魔咒一样地执著于被爱者身上最脆弱、最不完美的东西。这里的根本的问题是：典型的爱应该是两个平等的人之间身心具在的爱呢，抑或应该是存在于差异巨大的双方之间的跨越鸿沟的爱。如果是第一种情况，那么，交流就应该被设想为一种朝着\n“实现恋爱双方交融一体\n”方向作出的腾空一跃；如果是后者，那么，交流就应该被理解为一种在我们和他者身上拾掇一些能找到的碎片，因陋就简的凑合。对观福音中所提及的人类个体——那些为痛苦和强制所困扰的个体——在古典时期的希腊人眼中，奇怪而陌生。</p>\n<p>第一章 两种交流观：对话与撒播 &gt; 二、对观福音中的撒播 - 位置 2266\n爱是产生于对肉体的超越呢，还是产生于和肉体的接触？我们应该把交流看成是完美的接触呢，还是看成正因其不完美所以需要我们展现的耐心？交流的两种模式——对话和撒播——之间的对照，归根到底就是一句话：我们能够在多大程度上宽恕人类的愚蠢。</p>\n<p>第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 - 位置 2474 直到 19\n世纪后半叶，“交流”才获得了新的意思，即两个灵魂之间的非物质性接触。</p>\n<p>第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 - 位置 2488\n语言和符号仅仅是我们内在生活的粗糙外在载体。语词最多也就是因约定俗成而存在；它们“指示”存在于人脑中的意义，也“指示”外在世界中的客体。我们在表达自己思想的时候，将自己内心私密的东西托付给公共符号这样的“代理”（\nproxies\n）。其他人在与我们交流时，得到的也仅仅是这些“代理”，而不是我们在表达内心时具有的非常丰富的原意。因此，我们说出的每一句话都要么在符号交通的十字路口处趔趄摔倒，要么是径直穿越它，因而这个十字路口总是充满着互撞和堵塞。</p>\n<p>第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 &gt;\n一、“交流”观念的基督教根源 - 位置 2635\n我们在说话时，让心里的思想通过听者的耳朵进入他心里，我们让我们心里的词语成为外在的声音，这就叫言语（\nspeech）。然而，我们的思想不会在声音中消失，而是仍然保持完整；它采用了言语的形式，可是它的性质在这个过程中并没有改变。同样道理，我们可以说：道（\nDivine\nWord）虽然变成了肉身——但它的性质并没有发生变化——这样上帝就可以居住在我们之中。——奥古斯丁</p>\n<p>第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 &gt;\n一、“交流”观念的基督教根源 - 位置 2673\n在奥古斯丁看来，词语是同时指向外部现实与内部现实的标记，其关键作用是揭示内心世界，即思想和精神的世界。正如肉体是包裹人的外壳，语词也是包裹思想的外壳。</p>\n<p>第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 &gt;\n二、洛克：“交流”之意义从物质到精神的转变 - 位置 2864\n在历史上，“交流”一词主要指的是两个东西：传输的物理过程和形而上学的同体过程（\nconsubstantiation ）。</p>\n<p>第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 &gt;\n二、洛克：“交流”之意义从物质到精神的转变 - 位置 2909\n洛克将知识的基础建立在个体的感知上，这使得人与人之间的知识共享成为一个极大的困难。知识被视作是孤立隔绝的，其他人无法接触，仅局限于我们个人的感觉器官。“共同\n”（或公共）和 “私人\n”之间的区分，既是洛克财产思想的基础，也是他交流思想的基础。</p>\n<p>第二章 错谬之缘起：奥古斯丁、洛克和招魂术 &gt;\n三、“心灵融合”交流观之社会影响：19世纪的催眠术和招魂术 - 位置 3491\n总而言之，在现代的交流思想史上，曾出现过一长串的不同观念，它们均认为人类的交流可以不需要媒介，不需要额外解读。</p>\n<p>第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 &gt;\n一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4026\n奥古斯丁认为，我们不过是这个世界的匆匆过客，我们在此世的经历，恰如影视剧背景中的群众演员，只要可能，我们便可以尽量忽视；黑格尔则与奥古斯丁不同，他认为我们不能将手段和目的分离。知识之路需要我们一一走过，脚踏实地去全部完成，试图走捷径就会导致我们丧失智慧。</p>\n<p>第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 &gt;\n一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4055\n通过“主奴戏”比喻，黑格尔想表达的观点是：没有他者就没有自我。正如黑格尔所言，“只有在彼自我意识中，此自我意识才能够满意。”</p>\n<p>第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 &gt;\n一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4076\n如果一个具备常识的人会诉求于他的感觉，或诉求于他内心的启示，那么他和不同意其意见的人就不会再有任何关系；对与他有不同认识和感觉的人，他只需说，他到此为止，不再表达任何意见，这就行了。但换句话说，他这么做，实际上是践踏了人性（Humanität）之根本，因为人性之本质是要努力和他人求得一致；实际上，人性的本质只存在于已经实现的意识共同体中。——博尔赫斯</p>\n<p>第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 &gt;\n一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4079\n我的“私下的自我”对你是模糊的，但是我的“公开的自我”对我来说也是模糊的。“我即是他者。”</p>\n<p>第三章 一个更强有力的精神视野：黑格尔、马克思和克尔凯儿 &gt;\n一、黑格尔的交流观：“承认” - 位置 4096\n黑格尔认为，交流不是一种思想的原状运输，而是我们对自己的生活状态进行的一种组织活动，目的在于让所有的人都能得到相互认可。</p>\n<p>第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 &gt; 一、记录性媒介vs.传输性媒介 -\n位置 4851\n由于这些新媒介的扩散和记录功能，人的主体性讯息比过去得到了更加广泛的传播。</p>\n<p>第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 &gt; 一、记录性媒介vs.传输性媒介 -\n位置 4898\n传输性媒介使我们能够横穿空间，而记录性媒介则使我们能够在时间中纵横穿越。从前对声音、形象和经验的死刑判决现在已经获得减刑。言语和行动可以超越人体之本源而幸存下来。总而言之，记录性媒介使亡灵以新的方式复活再生。</p>\n<p>第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 &gt; 二、诠释学：一种与死者的交流方式\n- 位置 5184 爱默生的观点是，我们应该对文化（ culture ）与自然（ nature\n） [82]\n之间的相互关系具有一种敏感，文化给自然留下印记，自然也给文化留下印记。物质不只是泥土，它还能使我们觉察到上帝和他人的存在，能使自我从无休止的漫游中解放出来。</p>\n<p>第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 &gt; 二、诠释学：一种与死者的交流方式\n- 位置 5350\n现代媒介有这样一个效果：即将人的主体性和记忆这些脆弱而缥缈的东西外在化，将其变成一种可以任意回放的永久形态。为了降低这种外在化转换的难度，我们付出的代价就是——将人变成媒体中的幽灵。</p>\n<p>第四章 生者的幻象及与死者的对话 &gt; 三、死信：无法发出的讯息 - 位置\n5441 “死信处\n”处理的是交流中的物质性，而不是其据说存在的精神性。死信处是为失效的邮件准备的填埋场。存在着死信处这一事实本身就是一个永恒的纪念碑，证明交流绝对逃避不了物质的载体，也证明交流根本就没有什么天使般的、纯粹的符号。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒 - 位置 6090\n布拉德利也具有一种类似实用主义者的敏锐性。他认为，交流总是涉及推断和解读。他虽然认为不同个体的意识是互相隔绝的，但是他并不认为个体就会因此而深陷于这种相互隔绝中不能自拔。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒 - 位置 6135\n“运输是物理的，交流是精神的。”——库利</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n一、唯心主义：人与人之间的森严壁垒 - 位置 6168\n库利认为，个体的个性人格（ personality）不在别处，而存在于\n“我们各自通过面部表情和声音无意识地相互交流的内容\n”之中。个体发出的能指（ signifiers）包括 “幽灵般的表达\n”，比如面部表情和声音的粒质（ grain）等等。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n二、是欺骗还是接触？詹姆斯论灵异研究 - 位置 6227\n康德曾提出三个假设——自然法则、意志自由和灵魂不朽——并认为这三个法则的成立虽然无法证明，但都是理性的和道德的生活所必需的。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n二、是欺骗还是接触？詹姆斯论灵异研究 - 位置 6232\n康德同时认为人无法从自己的认知循环里跳出来。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6405\n在早期的电话文化中，人们谋求的是一种可以不需要 “在场提示 ”（\ncues）的交往模式。[68]电话既可以构成感官的障碍（交流双方不可见），也可以是感知的延伸（作为助听器和扩音器）。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6535\n我们的周围充满着各种符号，它们语焉不详，我们该如何去解读它们？我们犹豫不决，进退两难。一方面害怕染上偏执狂，认为\n“一切都是信息 ”；另一方面，如果不认为 “一切都是信息\n”，我们就可能会漏掉上帝发给我们的启示。某个符号，它到底是我们的自我投射，还是他者的表达；是我们主观解读产生的结果，还是客观世界显现出来的规律，我们无法确定。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6553\n在过去的二三十年间，文学理论界提出了这样一个问题：谁是意义的主人？意义产生于读者的创造、作者的意图、文本本身、解读者圈子、公认的经典原则，还是读者和文本之间的互动？或者说，谁都不能成为意义的主人，所有的意义都只能被\n“租用 ”而不能被 “拥有 ”？</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n三、伸出手去触摸人：电话的奇异之处 - 位置 6577\n无休无止的泣诉，偶尔夹杂些罕见的真相，如荒野中的呼唤——这就是许多现代传播的所遵循的公式，</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6763\n广播公司很快就意识到这一点。为了弥补广播节目中的“不在场感”，他们想出了各种各样的办法，如在现场设置“伙伴听众”，增加和强化播音的交谈特征，以及让播音员使用个性化的语气等等。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6815\n广播听众具有鲜明的特征，他们是彼此间存在着共同联系的群体（ consociate\n），而不是简单相加的群体（ congregate\n），或者说，广播听众不是基于地域，而是基于想象的共同体。肯特里尔和奥尔波特的研究预示了后来“想象的共同体”。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6878 媒介是人体的延伸</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6916\n阿多诺的受众观则更加细腻。他认为，广播的危险不在于它能够煽动乌合之众，而是在于它具有的个性化的能力，它能够将听众塞进毫无反思的安稳蚕茧中或虐待狂般的狂笑中。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6978\n人类的一切行动都是建立在某种策略性的虚假期望基础之上的，尽管破除某些不切实际的虚假期望对我们而言是有益的，但只要这种破除不损害我们的动物性信仰，抱有某些虚假期望对我们还是有好处的。如果非要确定阿多诺和默顿谁是谁非，也许我们得先回答另外一个问题：我们是更害怕被权力欺骗呢，还是更害怕被剥夺期望？</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6993\n人们在谈论今天的因特网时，一方面总是对新“政治性身体”——即参与性民主——充满美好梦想；另一方面我们又到处可以听到对“新色情人体”（\nnew bodies pornographic ）——即儿童沦为色魔的猎物——的噩梦般的担忧。</p>\n<p>第五章 去追求真正的联系，抑或去跨越鸿沟？&gt;\n四、广播：作为撒播vs.作为对话 - 位置 6997\n如果说，在过去，交流的成功是一门“跨越鸿沟去触摸”的艺术，是为了克服中介性的身体去触摸另一个人的灵魂的话；那么到了电子媒介时代，同样作为一门艺术，交流的成功就变成了跨越中介性的灵魂去触摸另一个人的身体。媒介中的“身体”虽然不是所谓“机器中的幽灵”，却是现代传播媒介中的一个核心的两难。</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 - 位置 7399\n“交流”的威力在于它具有克服时空障碍，拓宽人与人之间互动的能力，其动人之处（\npathos\n）在于它能超越有限的血肉之躯。交流暗示着无需触摸就可实现联络。</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 - 位置 7450\n按照黑格尔的教导，承认他者不是一个简单的感知（\nperception）问题，而是一个涉及如何建立人类秩序的问题。</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 - 位置 7456\n阿多诺巧妙地将政治问题和存在问题联系起来，他说：“我们常常遇到这样的断言：‘黑人、野蛮人和日本人是看着像猴子的动物。’这种断言是发生大屠杀的根本原因……人类的‘情感投射’（\npathic projection\n）机制决定了，那些掌权的人在看待他人时，不是从他人的独特方面来看待他人，而只是看到了自己形象的折射。”</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 &gt;\n一、图灵测试与肉体/爱欲的不可超越性 - 位置 7607 “人对他者的渴望”</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 &gt;\n一、图灵测试与肉体/爱欲的不可超越性 - 位置 7661\n一句话所处的历史语境，决定了我们对其进行解读时的参照范围和共鸣强度</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 &gt;\n二、动物及人类对非人生灵的共情 - 位置 7769\n动物行为学的全部目的都是为了寻求一个跨界空间，使得人类在与动物的对话中，能够在后者身上找到人类所想象的自己的另外一半。</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 &gt; 三、人类与外星人的交流\n- 位置 8037\n究竟是什么原因让我们竟然相信，世间所有的一切如此奇妙，但却并不是智能力量（如上帝）精心设计和传播的结果。</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 &gt; 三、人类与外星人的交流\n- 位置 8049\n我们不应该被那些试图与外星人交流的努力吓倒，而应该认识到，这种交流并无特殊之处；认识到我们和他者（包括地球上和外太空的一切生物）的会话都是通过符号进行的。</p>\n<p>第六章 机器、动物与外星人：各种不可交流性 &gt; 三、人类与外星人的交流\n- 位置 8079 皮尔士和詹姆斯并不赞成“人的内心生活（ inner life\n）是心灵主义（ mentalist\n）的虚构”这一观点，而是认为，人的内在性常常以他者的面目出现，而且人的内心生活的表现形式多样，分布在我们经验的各个领域；我们最好不要将我们的内心生活看成是由一个由“小矮人”（homunculus\n）操纵的控制台，而应将其看成是我们的一种行为，该行为与我们所做的其他一切是彼此连续而非隔离的；我们的内在和外在是同一个莫比乌斯带的两个侧面；我们尊重而不是贬低内心生活的丰富性，认为它是我们众多种复杂行为中的一种，它和我们的其他行为并无明显的差别。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8322\n用对话的碎片思考和说话，这已经成为我们的宿命。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8347\n们往往不愿意承认，日常交流中的一个核心问题，是“沟壑”（ gaps\n）的存在，虽然对于这种沟壑，大多数善于使用语言的人都能够进行巧妙的讨价还价。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 一、交流注定充满沟壑 - 位置 8352\n将会话视为“两个人通过轮流说话从而逐渐走向对彼此的充分理解”，这种对话观掩盖了两个深层的事实：一方面，无论有多少人参加，一切的话语（\ndiscourse\n）都必须要在前一发言和后一发言之间建立联系；另一方面，你的目标受话人也许永远不可能完全等同于你的实际受话人。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 二、接收者拥有的特权 - 位置 8356\n无论“交流”是何意思，交流的中心不应该是自我，而应该是对方。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 二、接收者拥有的特权- 位置 8366\n詹姆斯指出，我们人类的所有知识可能都是建筑在对各种欺骗行为的战略性隐瞒的基础上的；或者说，是建筑在对被某些人视为欺骗行为的战略性隐瞒的基础上的。这些人认为“知识不过是对客观世界的精确拷贝”。但是，判断知识的标准不应该是看它是否精确拷贝了客观世界，而应看它是否能最大限度地帮助我们前行。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 二、接收者拥有的特权 - 位置 8383\n交流不是关于思想运输的社会物理学 [4]\n，而是一个充满风险的领域，在其中任何人说话都必须为他从来就无法完美驾驭的东西负责——这个无法完美驾驭的东西，就是说话人的言行在听话人的心灵中产生的作用。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 二、接收者拥有的特权- 位置 8387\n交流的问题并非源于语言的捉摸不定，而是存在于自我和对方之间无法修补的分歧。交流的挑战不是如何做到忠实于我们的内心，而是坚持即使他人不能像我们看待自己那样来看我们，我们仍然能做到宽恕待人。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 三、交流的阴暗面 - 位置 8403\n交流是一种没有保证的冒险。凭借符号去建立联系的任何尝试，都是一场赌博，无论其发生的规模是大还是小。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 三、交流的阴暗面 - 位置 8442\n黑格尔和马克思、杜威和米德、阿多诺和哈贝马斯等思想家都认为，公正的（\njust\n）交流是健全社会的一个标志。我们应该少去操心符号是否会催生不同的意义，而更应该去操心是哪些因素让我们不能去关爱我们的邻居和那些与我们不同的存在物。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置 8464\n如果我们认为交流是真实思想的结合，那就是低估了身体的神圣。虽然这个时代技术已经可以充分地模拟人体，但身体是否真正在场仍然具有重要意义。触觉是人类最古老的感官，也许是最难以伪造的感官。这就是说，在同等情况下，互相关心的人会尽量到场见面</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置 8474\n触摸和时间，这两个我们可以共享但不能够复制和再生的东西，是我们真诚的惟一保证。</p>\n<p>结语 用手挤呀 &gt; 四、触觉与时间的不可化约性 - 位置 8490\n爱之悖论是，边界的具体性和要求的普遍性之间存在着矛盾。由于我们只能够和一些人而不是所有人共度时光，只能够接触一些人而不是所有人，因此，亲临而在场恐怕是我们能做到的最接近跨越人与人之间鸿沟的保证。在这一点上，我们直接面对的是我们的有限性，它既神圣又悲哀。</p>"},{"title":"《现实的社会构建》摘录二（完）","comments":0,"date":"2020-11-25T09:57:46.000Z","_content":"31. 当不同类型的行动者之间的惯例活动呈现为交互类型化（re ciprocal typification）时，制度化就出现了。换句话说，所有这种类型化都是制度。这里需要强调两点:**第一，制度类型化具有交互性**；**第二，制度之中的行动和行动者是类型化的**。同时，制度也意味着历史性和控制力。最大的收获就是彼此能够预测对方的行动，从而节省了时间和精力。\n<!--more-->\n\n32. 人类活动的外化产品获得客观性的过程，就叫做“客体化”。制度世界是客体化的人类活动，每项制度都不例外。\n\n33. **社会是人的产物，社会是客观现实，人是社会的产物。**\n\n34. **制度世界也需要正当化（ legitimation），即它需要被解释和被证明。**这并不是出于增强事实性的目的，因为就像我们看到的，社会世界在被传递到下一代的过程中已充分体现为事实。然而，这种事实是历史性的。对于接触它的下一代来说，它是传统而非个人记忆。对制度秩序来讲，这些秩序只有既连贯又全面才能说服下一代，对所有的孩子要讲同样的故事。随后，从扩张的制度秩序中又发展出相应的正当化华盖，在其上伸展着一个兼具认知性和规范性的保护罩。在新一代人接受社会化从而被纳入制度秩序的过程中，他们就学习了所有关于正当化的知识。\n\n35. 要完成制度的历史化和客体化，还需要发展出特定的社会控制机制。**无论个体在具体情境中赋予制度什么样的主观意义，制度都必须对个体宣示出权威性。**\n\n36. 因此，在人们对制度的逻辑进行任何阐述时都必须格外小心。这种逻辑并不内在于制度，与制度的外在功能亦无联系，而是由人们对制度的反思方式所决定的。换句话说，人们的反思意识把逻辑加到了制度秩序之上。\n\n37. **语言为客观化的社会世界提供了最基本的外置逻辑。**\n\n38. 个人在他的生活背景中的制度行为是离散的，但他的生活背景是一个反思性的整体，其中的离散行为不会被当成孤立事件，而是被视为隶属于一个主观意义的世界的事物。这一世界的意义并不专属于某个人，而是在社会层面上被表达和分享。只有借助于这样一个社会性共享的意义世界，制度整合的必要性才能浮现出来。\n\n39. 借助于语言和以语言为基础的认知工具，知识将世界客体化了。它把世界收纳进那些事实性的事物，而在社会化过程中，它又进一步被内化为“客观有效的真理”。因此有关社会的知识可被理解为一种“实现”（ realization），它具有两层意义:一是客体化的社会现实被理解了，二是这一现实被不断地生产出来。\n\n40. 在人类的总体经验中，只有一小部分会存留在意识里。这些被存留的经验沉积下来，凝结为记忆中可识别与可记忆的实体。\n\n41. 在思维上，人类既表现出精巧，也表现出盲信。\n\n42. 所有的制度化行为都包含着角色，因此角色也带有制度化的控制特征。只要行动者被类型化为角色扮演者，他们的行为就在事实上受到了监督。遵循或不遵循社会定义的角色标准，就不再是自由选择的了。当然，对于不遵循标准的行为，惩罚力度会依照具体情况来设定。\n\n43. 角色表征（ represent）着制度秩序。制度也可以通过其他方式被表征，比如语言、制造物体、法律等，但角色是最优的表征方式。\n\n44. 任何一个具体的角色表现都指向制度的客观意义，指向其他辅助性的角色表现，也指向制度的意义整体。角色乃是知识库的某个特定部分的中转者。\n\n45. 社会分配给知识制造出一种二分:普遍知识与角色专属知识。我们可以假定，由于劳动分工的存在，角色专属知识的增长速度将会快于那些大众化的普遍知识。劳动分工使得专门化的任务呈现几何式增长，换句话说，专家就会出现了。\n\n46. 一方面，只有在可以通过具体角色来实现的时候，制度秩序才是真实的；另一方面，角色是制度秩序的表达，后者决定了前者的特质（包括前者的附属知识），前者从后者那里获取客观意义。\n\n47. 正常来说，制度化的范围取决于关联结构的普遍性。如果一个社会中的很多甚至大多数关联结构都是人们普遍共享的，那么制度化的范围必然比较大。如果只有少部分关联结构被共享，制度化的范围就会比较窄，此时制度秩序还有可能高度碎片化，即特定的关联结构并不为社会整体而仅为社会中的部分群体所共享。\n\n48. 专业化的活动带来了公共知识的专业化和分隔化，而这种专业化和分隔化使得主观知识有可能脱离任何的社会关联，成为“纯理论”。这种分隔化以及伴随的知识分配有可能带来意义整合的问题，比如驱魔人在向战士解释自己的某些行为时可能遇到困难。同时，分隔化，也有可能带来的一个后果是，离散的子意义世界有可能出现，比如性别、职业、宗教等等。\n\n49. 制度的上述物化方式也适用于角色的物化。在自我意识中，那些已通过角色而被客观化的部分也会被视为一种无法避免的命运，这样个体就可以逃避一些责任。这种物化最典型的模式便是下面这种说法，“在这件事上我别无选择，我所处的位置（丈夫、父亲、将军、大主教、董事长、匪徒、刽子手，等等）决定了我必须这么做”。可见，角色的物化会缩小个人在他自己与所扮演的角色之间所形成的主观距离。客观化意义上的那种距离依然被保留，但是由认同问题所造成的可能的主观距离就缩小到零了。到了最后，身份本身（说成是总体自我也无妨）就被物化了。这里包括一个人对自己身份的认同，也包括对他人身份的认同。此时个体就完全等同于社会所分配给他的类型，他不是别的而就是那种类型。从价值或情感的角度讲，这种对类型化的理解既有可能凸显出正面意味，也有可能凸显出负面意味。比如“犹太人”。\n\n50. 制度化的第一个阶段无须正当化的参与。在此阶段，制度只是单纯的事实，它不需要得到主体间或主体生活史的支持，它对各方来讲都是自明的。可是当制度秩序（此时已成为历史）的客体化被传递到下一代时，正当化问题就必然要出现了。\n\n51. 当人类经验的语言客观化系统开始传递的时候，最初的正当化就出现。正当化的第二个层次由一些已具雏形的理论假设组成，在这里会出现一些客观意义丛的不同解释图式，比如谚语、道德准则、名人金句。正当化的第三个层次则由明晰的理论组成，比如旁系金属科学。\n\n52. 象征世界（ symbolic universe）构成了正当化的第四个层次。这一层次包含着各种理论的传统体系，它们把不同的意义领域整合起来，用一个象征总体（symbolic totality）来总括制度秩序。象征世界是由那些已被社会客体化的且具有主观真实性的所有“意义”所构成的矩阵。\n\n53. 象征世界可以简单第概括为“让一切各安其位”。象征世界还可以为社会的日常生活所出现的矛盾意义提供高高层级的整合。象征世界也能为生命的不同阶段赋予秩序。个人主观认同的“正确性”也需要借助同样的正当化功能来实现。对个人生活来说，象征世界还具有一种战略性的正当化功能，这就是“安置”死亡，看到他人死亡并由此产生对自己死亡的预期，这构成了一个人最特殊的边缘情境。象征世界的社会意义也能通过同样的方式得到展现，它们划定了现实的边界，哪些事物与社会互动有关，哪些无关，举个极端的例子，在原始社会中，就算是无机物也被当成无机物，在印度贱民和动物一样，在轮回的理论中得到正义化。象征世界也为历史安排了秩序。象征世界对所有离散的制度进行了综合。\n\n54. 象征世界根源于人的生物构造。如果社会中的人是世界的建构者，那么其原因就在于人的生物构造具有世界的开放性。这种开放性本来就意味着秩序与混乱之间的矛盾。人类的存在从一开始就是一种持续的外化。当人们将自己外化的时候，便建立起了可以实现这一过程的世界。在外化的过程中，个人把自身的意义投向现实。在象征世界中，所有的现实都具有人的意义，整个宇宙都确证着人的存在的正确性。因而，象征世界就是人类意义能够投射的最远距离。\n\n55. **所有的社会现象都是由人类活动在历史中制造出来的建筑物，没有任何社会是完全理所当然的**\n\n56. 维护世界的概念装置，有两种具有普遍理论意义的应用方式，即治疗和虚无。\n\n57. 所有社会建构的世界都属于人类活动的历史产物，故而它们会随人类的具体活动发生变化。现实是由社会定义的，但是，这种定义也是具身的。也就是说，特定的个人或群体乃是这些现实的定义者。要理解社会建构的世界在某一给定时刻的状态或是要了解它随时间所发生的变化，人们就必须了解该世界背后的社会组织。只有存在着相应的社会组织，人们才有可能对这一世界进行某种定义。这个道理可以说得再简单一点:在对历史上那些有关现实的概念体系进行分析时，我们必须要把问题由抽象的“是什么”（What？）转化为具体的社会学问题“谁说的”（Says who？）。\n\n58. 知识发展到一定阶段，就会出现两个问题，一个就是前面论述过的纯理论的出现。另一个问题，当制度行为被正当化之后，它的传统主义就会增强，制度的内在惰性会变的更强大，制度倾向于维持原来的状态。\n59. 一个理论是否具有实用的优势，并不看它的内在品质，而是看它对作为其承载者的社会利益群体有什么样的适用性。\n\n60. 多元化情境的出现以一个有着高水平劳动分工的城市社会为前提。\n\n61. 初级社会化所内化的世界在意识中要远比次级社会化所内化的世界更加坚实、牢固。无论有多少原初的必然性感觉在后来随着除魅而被削弱了，那种对于不再重来的确定性的回忆，那种初悟现实的确定性，都牢牢地附着于儿时的首属世界。\n\n62. 在这种社会中，跛子和私生子对于加在自己身上的污名身份几乎没有任何主观防御。对他自己、对他的重要他人以及对整个共同体来说，他就是他应是的那种人。当然，对于这种命运，他可能报以怨恨或愤怒，但这只能佐证他的低人一等。这些怨恨和愤怒甚至可以为社会给他定义的劣等身份提供最具决定性的承认，因为比其高等的人显然鲜有这些粗鲁的情感。\n\n63. 社会同时以主观现实和客观现实的形式存在，要对社会进行充分的理论理解，就必须同时考虑这两个方面。正如前文所表明的，如果把社会理解为一个由外化、客体化和内化三个步骤所组成的持续辩证过程，我们就能较为恰当地把握它的主客观两面性。不过，在考察具体的社会现象时，我们还应避免一种看法，即认为上述三个步骤是遵守时序的。实际上，社会和它的每个子部分都同时包含这三个步骤，因此，任何只考虑了一个或两个步骤的社会分析都是有缺陷的。对于社会中的个体成员来说也一样，他在社会世界中外化自身的存在，同时把社会世界作为客观现实予以内化。换句话说，生活在社会中，就参与了它的辩证法。\n\n64. 然而个体并非生来就是社会的一员，他只是天生带有一种社会性（ sociality）的倾向，随后才逐渐变成社会的一员。在个体的生命中存在着一个时间序列。随着时间的推移，个体被引导着参与到社会辩证法之中。\n\n65. 初级社会化（primary socialization）是个体在儿时所经历的第一次社会化。经此过程，个体变成了社会的一员。次级社会化（secandary socialization） （指其后的一种过程，它把已被社会化的个体引领到社会客观世界的新领域中。对个体来说，初级社会化自然是最重要的，而次级社会化则需要模仿初级社会化的基本结构。\n\n66. 换句话说，自我是一个反身的实体（reflected entity）。它反射着先前重要他人对它所采取的态度， 个体变成了他自己的重要他人所认定的那种人。这不是一个单向的机械过程，它包含了他人认同和自我认同之间的辩证法，即客观指派的身份与主观接纳的身份之间的辩证法。在个体对重要他人加以认同的每一时刻，这种辩证法都会浮现。\n\n67. 从重要他人的具体角色和具体态度出发所形成的这种抽象就被称为概化他人（generalized other）。概化他人一旦在意识中得以形成，就意味着个体不仅认同了具体的他人，也认同了一般性的他人，即认同了社会。只有通过这种概化认同，一个人的自我认同才能获得稳定性和持续性。\n\n68. 个体与客观社会世界之间的关系就像一个持续地寻求平衡的行为。\n\n69. 知识体系在整体象征世界中占有什么样的地位，决定了相应的次级社会化的特质。\n\n70. 在初级社会化中，儿童并不把他的重要他人理解为执行制度的人，而是把他们直接视为现实的中转者。儿童把父母的世界内化为唯一的世界，这个世界不归属于任何特定的制度背景。在初级社会化以后出现的某些危机实际上都是由之后的新认识导致的。此时一个人认识到，自己父母的世界并不是唯一存在的世界，它有着相当特殊的社会位置，甚至这个世界可能是糟糕的。\n\n71. 如何在初级社会化与次级社会化之间进行任务的制度化分配，受到知识的社会分配复杂度的影响。只要相对不太复杂，同一个制度机构就能完成从初级社会化到次级社会化的衔接，并承担后者的许多任务。在高度复杂的情况下就得发展出专门针对次级社会化的机构。这一机构中有着经过特殊培训的全职人员，他们承担着相应的教育使命。\n\n72. 初级社会化内化的是必然性的现实。与初级社会化相比，次级社会化具有更多的“人造”特质，这使得它所内化的主观现实在面对其他现实主义的挑战时更加脆弱。\n\n73. 次级的内化现实较少受到边缘情境的威胁，原因是它和边缘情境通常没什么联系。其实更有可能的是，正是因为人们看到了次现实与边缘情境无关，这种现实才被视为微不足道的。\n\n74. 对现实的维护来讲，我们不难区分出两种具有普遍意义的类型:例行维护（ routine maintenance）与危机维护（ crisis mainte- nance）前者用来维护日常生活中的内化现实，后者则用于危机情境。二者在本质上包含相同的社会过程，但也存在一些需要我们留意的差异。\n\n75. 在维护现实的社会过程中，人们可以区分出两类人:重要他人和非重要他人。人们在日常生活中遇到的所有人，或至少绝大部分人，都会以一种重要的方式来再次确认自己的主观现实。\n\n76. 交谈是最重要的现实维护工具。在交谈中，语言的客观化产物变成了个人意识中的客体。要过要有效地维护主观现实，交谈工具就必须具有持续性和一致性。\n\n77. 再社会化的现实基础是现在，而次级社会化的现实基础是过去。\n\n78. 失败的社会化带来“我是谁”的问题。\n\n79. 如果一个社会具有普遍的、以市场为基础的矛盾世界，那就会使主观现实和身份认同呈现出一些特殊构型。人们会日渐普遍地意识到所有世界的相对性，这其中也包括自己的世界，此时它在主观上被视为“某一世界”，而非“唯一世界”。于是就出现了这种结果:个人的制度化行为被理解为“一种角色”，个人可以在意识中把自己与角色分离开来，以操控的方式来“扮演”它。比如，贵族就不再简单地是个贵族，他会装成一个贵族，等等。与个人假扮自己的非预定身份相比，假扮自己的预定身份是性质完全不同的事情，它的影响要深远得多。在现代工业社会中，这种情形越来越普遍，但是，要对这种构型进行进一步的知识社会学和社会心理学分析，就显然超出了我们目前的讨论范围。我们只强调一点，要理解这种情形，就必须时刻把它和它的社会结构背景联系起来。因为从逻辑上讲，它体现的是劳动的社会分工（以及它对社会结构的影响）与知识的社会分配（以及它对现实的社会客体化的影响）之间的必然关系。在当代情境中，这就需要将现实、认同的多元化与工业主义的结构动力联系起来进行分析，尤其要关注工业主义给社会分层模式带来的变迁动力。\n\n80. 验证来自于心理学理论与经验可知的心理学事实之间的碰撞。心理学生成一个现实，现实反过来又成为理论验证的基础。\n\n81. 社会的可能性究竟在多大范围内对人类开放，这是由生物因素决定的，而社会世界本身对每个个体来说又是先在的，反过来对有机体的生物可能性施加了限制。\n\n82. 正是通过对生命和死亡所施加的权力，社会才展现了它对个人的终极控制。\n\n83. 社会现实不仅决定着活动与意识，它在很大程度上也决定着有机体的功能。\n\n84. 社会学的事业必须保持与历史学和哲学的话，否则它将失去恰当的研究对象。象就是作为人类世界一部分的社会。它人创造、由人栖居，并反过来在一个持续的历史进程中创造人。而人文主义社会学的一大贡献，就在于它重新唤起了我们对于这一蹊跷现象的好奇心。\n\n85. 社会学就是一个人文主义学科（humanistic discipline）这一概念带来了一个重要推论:社会学的事业必须保持与历史学和哲学的持续对话，否则它将失去恰当的研究对象。这个对象就是作为人类世界一部分的社会。它由人创造、由人栖居，并反过来在一个持续的历史进程中创造人。而人文主义社会学的一大贡献，就在于它重新唤起了我们对于这一蹊跷现象的好奇心。\n","source":"_posts/《现实的社会构建》摘录二（完）.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

typification）时，制度化就出现了。换句话说，所有这种类型化都是制度。这里需要强调两点:**第一，制度类型化具有交互性**；**第二，制度之中的行动和行动者是类型化的**。同时，制度也意味着历史性和控制力。最大的收获就是彼此能够预测对方的行动，从而节省了时间和精力。\n<!--more-->\n\n32. 人类活动的外化产品获得客观性的过程，就叫做“客体化”。制度世界是客体化的人类活动，每项制度都不例外。\n\n33. **社会是人的产物，社会是客观现实，人是社会的产物。**\n\n34. **制度世界也需要正当化（ legitimation），即它需要被解释和被证明。**这并不是出于增强事实性的目的，因为就像我们看到的，社会世界在被传递到下一代的过程中已充分体现为事实。然而，这种事实是历史性的。对于接触它的下一代来说，它是传统而非个人记忆。对制度秩序来讲，这些秩序只有既连贯又全面才能说服下一代，对所有的孩子要讲同样的故事。随后，从扩张的制度秩序中又发展出相应的正当化华盖，在其上伸展着一个兼具认知性和规范性的保护罩。在新一代人接受社会化从而被纳入制度秩序的过程中，他们就学习了所有关于正当化的知识。\n\n35. 要完成制度的历史化和客体化，还需要发展出特定的社会控制机制。**无论个体在具体情境中赋予制度什么样的主观意义，制度都必须对个体宣示出权威性。**\n\n36. 因此，在人们对制度的逻辑进行任何阐述时都必须格外小心。这种逻辑并不内在于制度，与制度的外在功能亦无联系，而是由人们对制度的反思方式所决定的。换句话说，人们的反思意识把逻辑加到了制度秩序之上。\n\n37. **语言为客观化的社会世界提供了最基本的外置逻辑。**\n\n38. 个人在他的生活背景中的制度行为是离散的，但他的生活背景是一个反思性的整体，其中的离散行为不会被当成孤立事件，而是被视为隶属于一个主观意义的世界的事物。这一世界的意义并不专属于某个人，而是在社会层面上被表达和分享。只有借助于这样一个社会性共享的意义世界，制度整合的必要性才能浮现出来。\n\n39. 借助于语言和以语言为基础的认知工具，知识将世界客体化了。它把世界收纳进那些事实性的事物，而在社会化过程中，它又进一步被内化为“客观有效的真理”。因此有关社会的知识可被理解为一种“实现”（ realization），它具有两层意义:一是客体化的社会现实被理解了，二是这一现实被不断地生产出来。\n\n40. 在人类的总体经验中，只有一小部分会存留在意识里。这些被存留的经验沉积下来，凝结为记忆中可识别与可记忆的实体。\n\n41. 在思维上，人类既表现出精巧，也表现出盲信。\n\n42. 所有的制度化行为都包含着角色，因此角色也带有制度化的控制特征。只要行动者被类型化为角色扮演者，他们的行为就在事实上受到了监督。遵循或不遵循社会定义的角色标准，就不再是自由选择的了。当然，对于不遵循标准的行为，惩罚力度会依照具体情况来设定。\n\n43. 角色表征（ represent）着制度秩序。制度也可以通过其他方式被表征，比如语言、制造物体、法律等，但角色是最优的表征方式。\n\n44. 任何一个具体的角色表现都指向制度的客观意义，指向其他辅助性的角色表现，也指向制度的意义整体。角色乃是知识库的某个特定部分的中转者。\n\n45. 社会分配给知识制造出一种二分:普遍知识与角色专属知识。我们可以假定，由于劳动分工的存在，角色专属知识的增长速度将会快于那些大众化的普遍知识。劳动分工使得专门化的任务呈现几何式增长，换句话说，专家就会出现了。\n\n46. 一方面，只有在可以通过具体角色来实现的时候，制度秩序才是真实的；另一方面，角色是制度秩序的表达，后者决定了前者的特质（包括前者的附属知识），前者从后者那里获取客观意义。\n\n47. 正常来说，制度化的范围取决于关联结构的普遍性。如果一个社会中的很多甚至大多数关联结构都是人们普遍共享的，那么制度化的范围必然比较大。如果只有少部分关联结构被共享，制度化的范围就会比较窄，此时制度秩序还有可能高度碎片化，即特定的关联结构并不为社会整体而仅为社会中的部分群体所共享。\n\n48. 专业化的活动带来了公共知识的专业化和分隔化，而这种专业化和分隔化使得主观知识有可能脱离任何的社会关联，成为“纯理论”。这种分隔化以及伴随的知识分配有可能带来意义整合的问题，比如驱魔人在向战士解释自己的某些行为时可能遇到困难。同时，分隔化，也有可能带来的一个后果是，离散的子意义世界有可能出现，比如性别、职业、宗教等等。\n\n49. 制度的上述物化方式也适用于角色的物化。在自我意识中，那些已通过角色而被客观化的部分也会被视为一种无法避免的命运，这样个体就可以逃避一些责任。这种物化最典型的模式便是下面这种说法，“在这件事上我别无选择，我所处的位置（丈夫、父亲、将军、大主教、董事长、匪徒、刽子手，等等）决定了我必须这么做”。可见，角色的物化会缩小个人在他自己与所扮演的角色之间所形成的主观距离。客观化意义上的那种距离依然被保留，但是由认同问题所造成的可能的主观距离就缩小到零了。到了最后，身份本身（说成是总体自我也无妨）就被物化了。这里包括一个人对自己身份的认同，也包括对他人身份的认同。此时个体就完全等同于社会所分配给他的类型，他不是别的而就是那种类型。从价值或情感的角度讲，这种对类型化的理解既有可能凸显出正面意味，也有可能凸显出负面意味。比如“犹太人”。\n\n50. 制度化的第一个阶段无须正当化的参与。在此阶段，制度只是单纯的事实，它不需要得到主体间或主体生活史的支持，它对各方来讲都是自明的。可是当制度秩序（此时已成为历史）的客体化被传递到下一代时，正当化问题就必然要出现了。\n\n51. 当人类经验的语言客观化系统开始传递的时候，最初的正当化就出现。正当化的第二个层次由一些已具雏形的理论假设组成，在这里会出现一些客观意义丛的不同解释图式，比如谚语、道德准则、名人金句。正当化的第三个层次则由明晰的理论组成，比如旁系金属科学。\n\n52. 象征世界（ symbolic

象征世界可以简单第概括为“让一切各安其位”。象征世界还可以为社会的日常生活所出现的矛盾意义提供高高层级的整合。象征世界也能为生命的不同阶段赋予秩序。个人主观认同的“正确性”也需要借助同样的正当化功能来实现。对个人生活来说，象征世界还具有一种战略性的正当化功能，这就是“安置”死亡，看到他人死亡并由此产生对自己死亡的预期，这构成了一个人最特殊的边缘情境。象征世界的社会意义也能通过同样的方式得到展现，它们划定了现实的边界，哪些事物与社会互动有关，哪些无关，举个极端的例子，在原始社会中，就算是无机物也被当成无机物，在印度贱民和动物一样，在轮回的理论中得到正义化。象征世界也为历史安排了秩序。象征世界对所有离散的制度进行了综合。\n\n54.

who？）。\n\n58. 知识发展到一定阶段，就会出现两个问题，一个就是前面论述过的纯理论的出现。另一个问题，当制度行为被正当化之后，它的传统主义就会增强，制度的内在惰性会变的更强大，制度倾向于维持原来的状态。\n59. 一个理论是否具有实用的优势，并不看它的内在品质，而是看它对作为其承载者的社会利益群体有什么样的适用性。\n\n60.

id=\"more\"></span></p></li>\n<li><p>人类活动的外化产品获得客观性的过程，就叫做“客体化”。制度世界是客体化的人类活动，每项制度都不例外。</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>社会是人的产物，社会是客观现实，人是社会的产物。</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>制度世界也需要正当化（\nlegitimation），即它需要被解释和被证明。</strong>这并不是出于增强事实性的目的，因为就像我们看到的，社会世界在被传递到下一代的过程中已充分体现为事实。然而，这种事实是历史性的。对于接触它的下一代来说，它是传统而非个人记忆。对制度秩序来讲，这些秩序只有既连贯又全面才能说服下一代，对所有的孩子要讲同样的故事。随后，从扩张的制度秩序中又发展出相应的正当化华盖，在其上伸展着一个兼具认知性和规范性的保护罩。在新一代人接受社会化从而被纳入制度秩序的过程中，他们就学习了所有关于正当化的知识。</p></li>\n<li><p>要完成制度的历史化和客体化，还需要发展出特定的社会控制机制。<strong>无论个体在具体情境中赋予制度什么样的主观意义，制度都必须对个体宣示出权威性。</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>因此，在人们对制度的逻辑进行任何阐述时都必须格外小心。这种逻辑并不内在于制度，与制度的外在功能亦无联系，而是由人们对制度的反思方式所决定的。换句话说，人们的反思意识把逻辑加到了制度秩序之上。</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>语言为客观化的社会世界提供了最基本的外置逻辑。</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>个人在他的生活背景中的制度行为是离散的，但他的生活背景是一个反思性的整体，其中的离散行为不会被当成孤立事件，而是被视为隶属于一个主观意义的世界的事物。这一世界的意义并不专属于某个人，而是在社会层面上被表达和分享。只有借助于这样一个社会性共享的意义世界，制度整合的必要性才能浮现出来。</p></li>\n<li><p>借助于语言和以语言为基础的认知工具，知识将世界客体化了。它把世界收纳进那些事实性的事物，而在社会化过程中，它又进一步被内化为“客观有效的真理”。因此有关社会的知识可被理解为一种“实现”（\nrealization），它具有两层意义:一是客体化的社会现实被理解了，二是这一现实被不断地生产出来。</p></li>\n<li><p>在人类的总体经验中，只有一小部分会存留在意识里。这些被存留的经验沉积下来，凝结为记忆中可识别与可记忆的实体。</p></li>\n<li><p>在思维上，人类既表现出精巧，也表现出盲信。</p></li>\n<li><p>所有的制度化行为都包含着角色，因此角色也带有制度化的控制特征。只要行动者被类型化为角色扮演者，他们的行为就在事实上受到了监督。遵循或不遵循社会定义的角色标准，就不再是自由选择的了。当然，对于不遵循标准的行为，惩罚力度会依照具体情况来设定。</p></li>\n<li><p>角色表征（\nrepresent）着制度秩序。制度也可以通过其他方式被表征，比如语言、制造物体、法律等，但角色是最优的表征方式。</p></li>\n<li><p>任何一个具体的角色表现都指向制度的客观意义，指向其他辅助性的角色表现，也指向制度的意义整体。角色乃是知识库的某个特定部分的中转者。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会分配给知识制造出一种二分:普遍知识与角色专属知识。我们可以假定，由于劳动分工的存在，角色专属知识的增长速度将会快于那些大众化的普遍知识。劳动分工使得专门化的任务呈现几何式增长，换句话说，专家就会出现了。</p></li>\n<li><p>一方面，只有在可以通过具体角色来实现的时候，制度秩序才是真实的；另一方面，角色是制度秩序的表达，后者决定了前者的特质（包括前者的附属知识），前者从后者那里获取客观意义。</p></li>\n<li><p>正常来说，制度化的范围取决于关联结构的普遍性。如果一个社会中的很多甚至大多数关联结构都是人们普遍共享的，那么制度化的范围必然比较大。如果只有少部分关联结构被共享，制度化的范围就会比较窄，此时制度秩序还有可能高度碎片化，即特定的关联结构并不为社会整体而仅为社会中的部分群体所共享。</p></li>\n<li><p>专业化的活动带来了公共知识的专业化和分隔化，而这种专业化和分隔化使得主观知识有可能脱离任何的社会关联，成为“纯理论”。这种分隔化以及伴随的知识分配有可能带来意义整合的问题，比如驱魔人在向战士解释自己的某些行为时可能遇到困难。同时，分隔化，也有可能带来的一个后果是，离散的子意义世界有可能出现，比如性别、职业、宗教等等。</p></li>\n<li><p>制度的上述物化方式也适用于角色的物化。在自我意识中，那些已通过角色而被客观化的部分也会被视为一种无法避免的命运，这样个体就可以逃避一些责任。这种物化最典型的模式便是下面这种说法，“在这件事上我别无选择，我所处的位置（丈夫、父亲、将军、大主教、董事长、匪徒、刽子手，等等）决定了我必须这么做”。可见，角色的物化会缩小个人在他自己与所扮演的角色之间所形成的主观距离。客观化意义上的那种距离依然被保留，但是由认同问题所造成的可能的主观距离就缩小到零了。到了最后，身份本身（说成是总体自我也无妨）就被物化了。这里包括一个人对自己身份的认同，也包括对他人身份的认同。此时个体就完全等同于社会所分配给他的类型，他不是别的而就是那种类型。从价值或情感的角度讲，这种对类型化的理解既有可能凸显出正面意味，也有可能凸显出负面意味。比如“犹太人”。</p></li>\n<li><p>制度化的第一个阶段无须正当化的参与。在此阶段，制度只是单纯的事实，它不需要得到主体间或主体生活史的支持，它对各方来讲都是自明的。可是当制度秩序（此时已成为历史）的客体化被传递到下一代时，正当化问题就必然要出现了。</p></li>\n<li><p>当人类经验的语言客观化系统开始传递的时候，最初的正当化就出现。正当化的第二个层次由一些已具雏形的理论假设组成，在这里会出现一些客观意义丛的不同解释图式，比如谚语、道德准则、名人金句。正当化的第三个层次则由明晰的理论组成，比如旁系金属科学。</p></li>\n<li><p>象征世界（ symbolic\nuniverse）构成了正当化的第四个层次。这一层次包含着各种理论的传统体系，它们把不同的意义领域整合起来，用一个象征总体（symbolic\ntotality）来总括制度秩序。象征世界是由那些已被社会客体化的且具有主观真实性的所有“意义”所构成的矩阵。</p></li>\n<li><p>象征世界可以简单第概括为“让一切各安其位”。象征世界还可以为社会的日常生活所出现的矛盾意义提供高高层级的整合。象征世界也能为生命的不同阶段赋予秩序。个人主观认同的“正确性”也需要借助同样的正当化功能来实现。对个人生活来说，象征世界还具有一种战略性的正当化功能，这就是“安置”死亡，看到他人死亡并由此产生对自己死亡的预期，这构成了一个人最特殊的边缘情境。象征世界的社会意义也能通过同样的方式得到展现，它们划定了现实的边界，哪些事物与社会互动有关，哪些无关，举个极端的例子，在原始社会中，就算是无机物也被当成无机物，在印度贱民和动物一样，在轮回的理论中得到正义化。象征世界也为历史安排了秩序。象征世界对所有离散的制度进行了综合。</p></li>\n<li><p>象征世界根源于人的生物构造。如果社会中的人是世界的建构者，那么其原因就在于人的生物构造具有世界的开放性。这种开放性本来就意味着秩序与混乱之间的矛盾。人类的存在从一开始就是一种持续的外化。当人们将自己外化的时候，便建立起了可以实现这一过程的世界。在外化的过程中，个人把自身的意义投向现实。在象征世界中，所有的现实都具有人的意义，整个宇宙都确证着人的存在的正确性。因而，象征世界就是人类意义能够投射的最远距离。</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>所有的社会现象都是由人类活动在历史中制造出来的建筑物，没有任何社会是完全理所当然的</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>维护世界的概念装置，有两种具有普遍理论意义的应用方式，即治疗和虚无。</p></li>\n<li><p>所有社会建构的世界都属于人类活动的历史产物，故而它们会随人类的具体活动发生变化。现实是由社会定义的，但是，这种定义也是具身的。也就是说，特定的个人或群体乃是这些现实的定义者。要理解社会建构的世界在某一给定时刻的状态或是要了解它随时间所发生的变化，人们就必须了解该世界背后的社会组织。只有存在着相应的社会组织，人们才有可能对这一世界进行某种定义。这个道理可以说得再简单一点:在对历史上那些有关现实的概念体系进行分析时，我们必须要把问题由抽象的“是什么”（What？）转化为具体的社会学问题“谁说的”（Says\nwho？）。</p></li>\n<li><p>知识发展到一定阶段，就会出现两个问题，一个就是前面论述过的纯理论的出现。另一个问题，当制度行为被正当化之后，它的传统主义就会增强，制度的内在惰性会变的更强大，制度倾向于维持原来的状态。</p></li>\n<li><p>一个理论是否具有实用的优势，并不看它的内在品质，而是看它对作为其承载者的社会利益群体有什么样的适用性。</p></li>\n<li><p>多元化情境的出现以一个有着高水平劳动分工的城市社会为前提。</p></li>\n<li><p>初级社会化所内化的世界在意识中要远比次级社会化所内化的世界更加坚实、牢固。无论有多少原初的必然性感觉在后来随着除魅而被削弱了，那种对于不再重来的确定性的回忆，那种初悟现实的确定性，都牢牢地附着于儿时的首属世界。</p></li>\n<li><p>在这种社会中，跛子和私生子对于加在自己身上的污名身份几乎没有任何主观防御。对他自己、对他的重要他人以及对整个共同体来说，他就是他应是的那种人。当然，对于这种命运，他可能报以怨恨或愤怒，但这只能佐证他的低人一等。这些怨恨和愤怒甚至可以为社会给他定义的劣等身份提供最具决定性的承认，因为比其高等的人显然鲜有这些粗鲁的情感。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会同时以主观现实和客观现实的形式存在，要对社会进行充分的理论理解，就必须同时考虑这两个方面。正如前文所表明的，如果把社会理解为一个由外化、客体化和内化三个步骤所组成的持续辩证过程，我们就能较为恰当地把握它的主客观两面性。不过，在考察具体的社会现象时，我们还应避免一种看法，即认为上述三个步骤是遵守时序的。实际上，社会和它的每个子部分都同时包含这三个步骤，因此，任何只考虑了一个或两个步骤的社会分析都是有缺陷的。对于社会中的个体成员来说也一样，他在社会世界中外化自身的存在，同时把社会世界作为客观现实予以内化。换句话说，生活在社会中，就参与了它的辩证法。</p></li>\n<li><p>然而个体并非生来就是社会的一员，他只是天生带有一种社会性（\nsociality）的倾向，随后才逐渐变成社会的一员。在个体的生命中存在着一个时间序列。随着时间的推移，个体被引导着参与到社会辩证法之中。</p></li>\n<li><p>初级社会化（primary\nsocialization）是个体在儿时所经历的第一次社会化。经此过程，个体变成了社会的一员。次级社会化（secandary\nsocialization）\n（指其后的一种过程，它把已被社会化的个体引领到社会客观世界的新领域中。对个体来说，初级社会化自然是最重要的，而次级社会化则需要模仿初级社会化的基本结构。</p></li>\n<li><p>换句话说，自我是一个反身的实体（reflected\nentity）。它反射着先前重要他人对它所采取的态度，\n个体变成了他自己的重要他人所认定的那种人。这不是一个单向的机械过程，它包含了他人认同和自我认同之间的辩证法，即客观指派的身份与主观接纳的身份之间的辩证法。在个体对重要他人加以认同的每一时刻，这种辩证法都会浮现。</p></li>\n<li><p>从重要他人的具体角色和具体态度出发所形成的这种抽象就被称为概化他人（generalized\nother）。概化他人一旦在意识中得以形成，就意味着个体不仅认同了具体的他人，也认同了一般性的他人，即认同了社会。只有通过这种概化认同，一个人的自我认同才能获得稳定性和持续性。</p></li>\n<li><p>个体与客观社会世界之间的关系就像一个持续地寻求平衡的行为。</p></li>\n<li><p>知识体系在整体象征世界中占有什么样的地位，决定了相应的次级社会化的特质。</p></li>\n<li><p>在初级社会化中，儿童并不把他的重要他人理解为执行制度的人，而是把他们直接视为现实的中转者。儿童把父母的世界内化为唯一的世界，这个世界不归属于任何特定的制度背景。在初级社会化以后出现的某些危机实际上都是由之后的新认识导致的。此时一个人认识到，自己父母的世界并不是唯一存在的世界，它有着相当特殊的社会位置，甚至这个世界可能是糟糕的。</p></li>\n<li><p>如何在初级社会化与次级社会化之间进行任务的制度化分配，受到知识的社会分配复杂度的影响。只要相对不太复杂，同一个制度机构就能完成从初级社会化到次级社会化的衔接，并承担后者的许多任务。在高度复杂的情况下就得发展出专门针对次级社会化的机构。这一机构中有着经过特殊培训的全职人员，他们承担着相应的教育使命。</p></li>\n<li><p>初级社会化内化的是必然性的现实。与初级社会化相比，次级社会化具有更多的“人造”特质，这使得它所内化的主观现实在面对其他现实主义的挑战时更加脆弱。</p></li>\n<li><p>次级的内化现实较少受到边缘情境的威胁，原因是它和边缘情境通常没什么联系。其实更有可能的是，正是因为人们看到了次现实与边缘情境无关，这种现实才被视为微不足道的。</p></li>\n<li><p>对现实的维护来讲，我们不难区分出两种具有普遍意义的类型:例行维护（\nroutine maintenance）与危机维护（ crisis mainte-\nnance）前者用来维护日常生活中的内化现实，后者则用于危机情境。二者在本质上包含相同的社会过程，但也存在一些需要我们留意的差异。</p></li>\n<li><p>在维护现实的社会过程中，人们可以区分出两类人:重要他人和非重要他人。人们在日常生活中遇到的所有人，或至少绝大部分人，都会以一种重要的方式来再次确认自己的主观现实。</p></li>\n<li><p>交谈是最重要的现实维护工具。在交谈中，语言的客观化产物变成了个人意识中的客体。要过要有效地维护主观现实，交谈工具就必须具有持续性和一致性。</p></li>\n<li><p>再社会化的现实基础是现在，而次级社会化的现实基础是过去。</p></li>\n<li><p>失败的社会化带来“我是谁”的问题。</p></li>\n<li><p>如果一个社会具有普遍的、以市场为基础的矛盾世界，那就会使主观现实和身份认同呈现出一些特殊构型。人们会日渐普遍地意识到所有世界的相对性，这其中也包括自己的世界，此时它在主观上被视为“某一世界”，而非“唯一世界”。于是就出现了这种结果:个人的制度化行为被理解为“一种角色”，个人可以在意识中把自己与角色分离开来，以操控的方式来“扮演”它。比如，贵族就不再简单地是个贵族，他会装成一个贵族，等等。与个人假扮自己的非预定身份相比，假扮自己的预定身份是性质完全不同的事情，它的影响要深远得多。在现代工业社会中，这种情形越来越普遍，但是，要对这种构型进行进一步的知识社会学和社会心理学分析，就显然超出了我们目前的讨论范围。我们只强调一点，要理解这种情形，就必须时刻把它和它的社会结构背景联系起来。因为从逻辑上讲，它体现的是劳动的社会分工（以及它对社会结构的影响）与知识的社会分配（以及它对现实的社会客体化的影响）之间的必然关系。在当代情境中，这就需要将现实、认同的多元化与工业主义的结构动力联系起来进行分析，尤其要关注工业主义给社会分层模式带来的变迁动力。</p></li>\n<li><p>验证来自于心理学理论与经验可知的心理学事实之间的碰撞。心理学生成一个现实，现实反过来又成为理论验证的基础。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会的可能性究竟在多大范围内对人类开放，这是由生物因素决定的，而社会世界本身对每个个体来说又是先在的，反过来对有机体的生物可能性施加了限制。</p></li>\n<li><p>正是通过对生命和死亡所施加的权力，社会才展现了它对个人的终极控制。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会现实不仅决定着活动与意识，它在很大程度上也决定着有机体的功能。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会学的事业必须保持与历史学和哲学的话，否则它将失去恰当的研究对象。象就是作为人类世界一部分的社会。它人创造、由人栖居，并反过来在一个持续的历史进程中创造人。而人文主义社会学的一大贡献，就在于它重新唤起了我们对于这一蹊跷现象的好奇心。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会学就是一个人文主义学科（humanistic\ndiscipline）这一概念带来了一个重要推论:社会学的事业必须保持与历史学和哲学的持续对话，否则它将失去恰当的研究对象。这个对象就是作为人类世界一部分的社会。它由人创造、由人栖居，并反过来在一个持续的历史进程中创造人。而人文主义社会学的一大贡献，就在于它重新唤起了我们对于这一蹊跷现象的好奇心。</p></li>\n</ol>\n","related_posts":[],"length":5771,"excerpt":"<ol

symbolic\nuniverse）构成了正当化的第四个层次。这一层次包含着各种理论的传统体系，它们把不同的意义领域整合起来，用一个象征总体（symbolic\ntotality）来总括制度秩序。象征世界是由那些已被社会客体化的且具有主观真实性的所有“意义”所构成的矩阵。</p></li>\n<li><p>象征世界可以简单第概括为“让一切各安其位”。象征世界还可以为社会的日常生活所出现的矛盾意义提供高高层级的整合。象征世界也能为生命的不同阶段赋予秩序。个人主观认同的“正确性”也需要借助同样的正当化功能来实现。对个人生活来说，象征世界还具有一种战略性的正当化功能，这就是“安置”死亡，看到他人死亡并由此产生对自己死亡的预期，这构成了一个人最特殊的边缘情境。象征世界的社会意义也能通过同样的方式得到展现，它们划定了现实的边界，哪些事物与社会互动有关，哪些无关，举个极端的例子，在原始社会中，就算是无机物也被当成无机物，在印度贱民和动物一样，在轮回的理论中得到正义化。象征世界也为历史安排了秩序。象征世界对所有离散的制度进行了综合。</p></li>\n<li><p>象征世界根源于人的生物构造。如果社会中的人是世界的建构者，那么其原因就在于人的生物构造具有世界的开放性。这种开放性本来就意味着秩序与混乱之间的矛盾。人类的存在从一开始就是一种持续的外化。当人们将自己外化的时候，便建立起了可以实现这一过程的世界。在外化的过程中，个人把自身的意义投向现实。在象征世界中，所有的现实都具有人的意义，整个宇宙都确证着人的存在的正确性。因而，象征世界就是人类意义能够投射的最远距离。</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>所有的社会现象都是由人类活动在历史中制造出来的建筑物，没有任何社会是完全理所当然的</strong></p></li>\n<li><p>维护世界的概念装置，有两种具有普遍理论意义的应用方式，即治疗和虚无。</p></li>\n<li><p>所有社会建构的世界都属于人类活动的历史产物，故而它们会随人类的具体活动发生变化。现实是由社会定义的，但是，这种定义也是具身的。也就是说，特定的个人或群体乃是这些现实的定义者。要理解社会建构的世界在某一给定时刻的状态或是要了解它随时间所发生的变化，人们就必须了解该世界背后的社会组织。只有存在着相应的社会组织，人们才有可能对这一世界进行某种定义。这个道理可以说得再简单一点:在对历史上那些有关现实的概念体系进行分析时，我们必须要把问题由抽象的“是什么”（What？）转化为具体的社会学问题“谁说的”（Says\nwho？）。</p></li>\n<li><p>知识发展到一定阶段，就会出现两个问题，一个就是前面论述过的纯理论的出现。另一个问题，当制度行为被正当化之后，它的传统主义就会增强，制度的内在惰性会变的更强大，制度倾向于维持原来的状态。</p></li>\n<li><p>一个理论是否具有实用的优势，并不看它的内在品质，而是看它对作为其承载者的社会利益群体有什么样的适用性。</p></li>\n<li><p>多元化情境的出现以一个有着高水平劳动分工的城市社会为前提。</p></li>\n<li><p>初级社会化所内化的世界在意识中要远比次级社会化所内化的世界更加坚实、牢固。无论有多少原初的必然性感觉在后来随着除魅而被削弱了，那种对于不再重来的确定性的回忆，那种初悟现实的确定性，都牢牢地附着于儿时的首属世界。</p></li>\n<li><p>在这种社会中，跛子和私生子对于加在自己身上的污名身份几乎没有任何主观防御。对他自己、对他的重要他人以及对整个共同体来说，他就是他应是的那种人。当然，对于这种命运，他可能报以怨恨或愤怒，但这只能佐证他的低人一等。这些怨恨和愤怒甚至可以为社会给他定义的劣等身份提供最具决定性的承认，因为比其高等的人显然鲜有这些粗鲁的情感。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会同时以主观现实和客观现实的形式存在，要对社会进行充分的理论理解，就必须同时考虑这两个方面。正如前文所表明的，如果把社会理解为一个由外化、客体化和内化三个步骤所组成的持续辩证过程，我们就能较为恰当地把握它的主客观两面性。不过，在考察具体的社会现象时，我们还应避免一种看法，即认为上述三个步骤是遵守时序的。实际上，社会和它的每个子部分都同时包含这三个步骤，因此，任何只考虑了一个或两个步骤的社会分析都是有缺陷的。对于社会中的个体成员来说也一样，他在社会世界中外化自身的存在，同时把社会世界作为客观现实予以内化。换句话说，生活在社会中，就参与了它的辩证法。</p></li>\n<li><p>然而个体并非生来就是社会的一员，他只是天生带有一种社会性（\nsociality）的倾向，随后才逐渐变成社会的一员。在个体的生命中存在着一个时间序列。随着时间的推移，个体被引导着参与到社会辩证法之中。</p></li>\n<li><p>初级社会化（primary\nsocialization）是个体在儿时所经历的第一次社会化。经此过程，个体变成了社会的一员。次级社会化（secandary\nsocialization）\n（指其后的一种过程，它把已被社会化的个体引领到社会客观世界的新领域中。对个体来说，初级社会化自然是最重要的，而次级社会化则需要模仿初级社会化的基本结构。</p></li>\n<li><p>换句话说，自我是一个反身的实体（reflected\nentity）。它反射着先前重要他人对它所采取的态度，\n个体变成了他自己的重要他人所认定的那种人。这不是一个单向的机械过程，它包含了他人认同和自我认同之间的辩证法，即客观指派的身份与主观接纳的身份之间的辩证法。在个体对重要他人加以认同的每一时刻，这种辩证法都会浮现。</p></li>\n<li><p>从重要他人的具体角色和具体态度出发所形成的这种抽象就被称为概化他人（generalized\nother）。概化他人一旦在意识中得以形成，就意味着个体不仅认同了具体的他人，也认同了一般性的他人，即认同了社会。只有通过这种概化认同，一个人的自我认同才能获得稳定性和持续性。</p></li>\n<li><p>个体与客观社会世界之间的关系就像一个持续地寻求平衡的行为。</p></li>\n<li><p>知识体系在整体象征世界中占有什么样的地位，决定了相应的次级社会化的特质。</p></li>\n<li><p>在初级社会化中，儿童并不把他的重要他人理解为执行制度的人，而是把他们直接视为现实的中转者。儿童把父母的世界内化为唯一的世界，这个世界不归属于任何特定的制度背景。在初级社会化以后出现的某些危机实际上都是由之后的新认识导致的。此时一个人认识到，自己父母的世界并不是唯一存在的世界，它有着相当特殊的社会位置，甚至这个世界可能是糟糕的。</p></li>\n<li><p>如何在初级社会化与次级社会化之间进行任务的制度化分配，受到知识的社会分配复杂度的影响。只要相对不太复杂，同一个制度机构就能完成从初级社会化到次级社会化的衔接，并承担后者的许多任务。在高度复杂的情况下就得发展出专门针对次级社会化的机构。这一机构中有着经过特殊培训的全职人员，他们承担着相应的教育使命。</p></li>\n<li><p>初级社会化内化的是必然性的现实。与初级社会化相比，次级社会化具有更多的“人造”特质，这使得它所内化的主观现实在面对其他现实主义的挑战时更加脆弱。</p></li>\n<li><p>次级的内化现实较少受到边缘情境的威胁，原因是它和边缘情境通常没什么联系。其实更有可能的是，正是因为人们看到了次现实与边缘情境无关，这种现实才被视为微不足道的。</p></li>\n<li><p>对现实的维护来讲，我们不难区分出两种具有普遍意义的类型:例行维护（\nroutine maintenance）与危机维护（ crisis mainte-\nnance）前者用来维护日常生活中的内化现实，后者则用于危机情境。二者在本质上包含相同的社会过程，但也存在一些需要我们留意的差异。</p></li>\n<li><p>在维护现实的社会过程中，人们可以区分出两类人:重要他人和非重要他人。人们在日常生活中遇到的所有人，或至少绝大部分人，都会以一种重要的方式来再次确认自己的主观现实。</p></li>\n<li><p>交谈是最重要的现实维护工具。在交谈中，语言的客观化产物变成了个人意识中的客体。要过要有效地维护主观现实，交谈工具就必须具有持续性和一致性。</p></li>\n<li><p>再社会化的现实基础是现在，而次级社会化的现实基础是过去。</p></li>\n<li><p>失败的社会化带来“我是谁”的问题。</p></li>\n<li><p>如果一个社会具有普遍的、以市场为基础的矛盾世界，那就会使主观现实和身份认同呈现出一些特殊构型。人们会日渐普遍地意识到所有世界的相对性，这其中也包括自己的世界，此时它在主观上被视为“某一世界”，而非“唯一世界”。于是就出现了这种结果:个人的制度化行为被理解为“一种角色”，个人可以在意识中把自己与角色分离开来，以操控的方式来“扮演”它。比如，贵族就不再简单地是个贵族，他会装成一个贵族，等等。与个人假扮自己的非预定身份相比，假扮自己的预定身份是性质完全不同的事情，它的影响要深远得多。在现代工业社会中，这种情形越来越普遍，但是，要对这种构型进行进一步的知识社会学和社会心理学分析，就显然超出了我们目前的讨论范围。我们只强调一点，要理解这种情形，就必须时刻把它和它的社会结构背景联系起来。因为从逻辑上讲，它体现的是劳动的社会分工（以及它对社会结构的影响）与知识的社会分配（以及它对现实的社会客体化的影响）之间的必然关系。在当代情境中，这就需要将现实、认同的多元化与工业主义的结构动力联系起来进行分析，尤其要关注工业主义给社会分层模式带来的变迁动力。</p></li>\n<li><p>验证来自于心理学理论与经验可知的心理学事实之间的碰撞。心理学生成一个现实，现实反过来又成为理论验证的基础。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会的可能性究竟在多大范围内对人类开放，这是由生物因素决定的，而社会世界本身对每个个体来说又是先在的，反过来对有机体的生物可能性施加了限制。</p></li>\n<li><p>正是通过对生命和死亡所施加的权力，社会才展现了它对个人的终极控制。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会现实不仅决定着活动与意识，它在很大程度上也决定着有机体的功能。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会学的事业必须保持与历史学和哲学的话，否则它将失去恰当的研究对象。象就是作为人类世界一部分的社会。它人创造、由人栖居，并反过来在一个持续的历史进程中创造人。而人文主义社会学的一大贡献，就在于它重新唤起了我们对于这一蹊跷现象的好奇心。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会学就是一个人文主义学科（humanistic\ndiscipline）这一概念带来了一个重要推论:社会学的事业必须保持与历史学和哲学的持续对话，否则它将失去恰当的研究对象。这个对象就是作为人类世界一部分的社会。它由人创造、由人栖居，并反过来在一个持续的历史进程中创造人。而人文主义社会学的一大贡献，就在于它重新唤起了我们对于这一蹊跷现象的好奇心。</p></li>\n</ol>"},{"title":"《知识的错觉》摘抄","comments":0,"date":"2018-03-22T06:38:54.000Z","_content":"《知识的错觉》是上上周看完，眼看这一周又要结束了，我却依然没有完成关于这本书的一些思考评论。事实上，我的草稿箱中，躺着好几篇文章有待完成，有的我觉得已经不需要再去惦记了，因为不需要去完成了，有的还在思考怎么写一下，只是开了一个头就再没有下文了。总是试着去写点儿什么，可是到头来，我不过是在重复自己的过往经历，这种无意义的重复并不会为我带来什么新的体验，只不过是让一些反复思考过的东西输出出来，然后去进行下一波的思考。\n<!--more-->\n闲言少叙，《知识的错觉》是一本能够培养对认知科学兴趣的畅销书，说是畅销书，就一定不会有非常深入的见解。但是这本书我却觉得非常值得一读，因为这本书会让我们意识到很多显而易见但是不会去关注的一些事实，作为一本畅销书，是非常合格的。\n\n#

**知识社会的分析对象就是现实的社会构建。**\n<!--more-->\n2. 与“思想”相比，**常识性的“知识”才是知识社会的焦点**，正是这种“知识”构造出了所有社会赖以维系的意义之网。\n\n3. 我们对知识社会的性质和范围的重新定义将把它从社会学理论的边缘移至中心……在这条研究道路上，我们紧紧跟随着的，恰恰是社会学领域最著名和最优影响力的两个“行军号”。它们分别是**涂尔干的《社会学方法准则》**和**韦伯的《经济与社会》**。涂尔干告诉我们：**“最基本和最首要的原则是：把社会事实视为物。”**，韦伯则观察到：**“行动的主观意识丛结是历史和当前社会学的认识对象。”**。\n\n4. 在本书中，给出的定义。“现实”是某些现象的属性，这些现象都是独立于人、不以人的意志为转移的（我们不能凭主观愿望使其消失）；“知识”则是一种确定性，它确证了某些现象是真的并且包含一些基本特征。社会学对“现实”和“知识”的理解介于普通人和哲学家之间。对于普通人，“现实”和“知识”是一些理所当然的东西。对于社会学家来说，“现实”和“知识”在不同的社会中有着很大差别，需要依据学科逻辑来进行思考。对于哲学家，执着于关于世界的可靠判断和不可靠判断，以此来决定何处不用加引号，何处需要加引号。\n\n5. **“知识社会学”不仅事关人类社会的“知识”在经验上所表现出的多样性，而且事关一切“知识”在成为“现实”时所经历的社会过程。**\n\n6. 知识社会学直接的思想来源还要归属于19世纪德国思想的三大发展：**马克思主义**、**尼采哲学**和**历史主义**。\n\n7. 知识社会学从马克思那里获得了它的基础命题：**人们的社会存在决定人们的意识**。对于马克思提出来的“下层结构/上层结构”，也许简单的理解为经济决定论是一种机械而非辩证的误解。也许该理解为，“下层结构”理解为人类活动，“上层结构”理解为人类活动创造出的世界。\n\n8. **尼采认为：思想乃是人类谋求生存和权力的工具**。通过剖析“欺骗”和“自欺”的社会意义，并把“假象”视为生活的必要条件，尼采提出了自己的“虚假意识论”。尼采在知识社会学最主要的著作是《道德的谱系》和《权力意志》。\n\n9. 以威廉·狄尔泰(Wilhelm Dilthey)的作品为代表的历史主义是知识社会学的前身。历史主义重在强调，关于人类事务的所有看法都被相对性笼罩，**人类思想具有不可避免的历史性**。\n\n10. 舍勒强调，人类知识在社会中是以先验的形式呈现的，它先于个人经验并为其提供意义秩序。这一秩序尽管与特定的社会——历史情景有关，但对个体来说是一种看待世界的自然方式。这一秩序被称为“相对化的自然世界观”。\n\n11. 曼海姆最为关注意识形态这一现象。他将意识形态划分为特定的、总体的和普遍的三种类型:特定的意识形态指向对立者的部分观念；总体的意识形态指向对立者的整个观念体系（类似于马克思所说的“虚假意识”）；普遍的意识形态不仅包括我们的对立者，而且包括我们自己的观念，而曼海姆认为，正是在这一点上，马克思被超越了。普遍的意识形态主张所有人类思想（除了上文提到的一些例外）都受其所在社会背景的意识形态影响，这个思路就到达了知识社会学的层次。通过这种扩充，曼海姆试图将意识形态理论的核心问题从政治用语的情境中抽离出来，将其转化为更具普遍意义的认识论和历史社会学问题。\n\n12. 知识社会学必须关注社会中所有被当作“知识”的事物。**在一个社会中，虽然只有少数人关心对于世界的理论解释，但是所有人都生活在某种世界中。**\n\n13. **日常生活现实是理所当然的，它简单地存在着，并不需要额外的论证。它就在那儿，不证自明，是一种不可抗拒的事实，我知道它是真实的。**\n\n14. 当我因为某些原因在日常生活的时间结构中“迷失”之时，我会几近本能地寻求“重新定向”。我会看看手表，尝试记起今天是什么日子，借助这些行为来重回日常生活现实。\n\n15. **语义场**决定了个人和社会的总体经验中哪些被保存、哪些被遗忘。通过这种积累，一个社会知识库就形成了，它代代相传，被日常生活中的个人所继承。\n\n16. **意识总具有意向性**，它永远包含着意图或直接指向对象。我们永远不可能把握住某些所谓的意识本身的内在基质（substratum），而只能讨论关于某物的意识。不管意识的对象是关于外在物质世界的经验，还是对于主观现实元素的理解，都不例外。当“我”（第一人称单数，在此处及下面的讨论中均表示日常生活中的一般化的自我意识）俯瞰纽约全景或是当“我”意识到内心的焦虑时，意识过程都带有意向性。\n\n17. 在人的意识中，不同的对象组成了不同领域的现实。**在“我”眼中，日常生活中需要打交道的人与梦境中的虚幻人物分属于不同的现实**。\n\n18. 在各种现实中，有一种现实最为突出，这就是日常生活现实，它的特殊地位使它获得了至尊现实（paramount reality）的称号。在日常生活中，意识最为紧张，因为日常生活以一种最沉重、最紧迫和最强烈的方式将自己置于意识之上。要忽视它是不可能的，即便要削弱它的显著性都非常困难。因此，日常生活的现实迫使我必须全力投入其中。**我在完全清醒的状态下体验日常生活，我完全清醒地认识到，自己存在于日常生活的现实之中，并且我也理解它。**这种清醒状态对我来说是正常的和自明的，它构成了我的自然态度。\n\n    对我来说，日常生活现实是井然有序的，它的现象遵从一些提前安排好的模式。这些模式外在于我对它们的理解，并且凌驾于这种理解之上。日常生活现实看上去已然是客观化的，它的组成分是一系列在我出场之前就已存在的客体。**日常语言为我持续提供必要的客观化**，设定好一种秩序。这种秩序既使客观化变得合理，也使我体验到日常生活的意义。我生活在一个具有确切地理位置的地方；我使用开瓶器和跑车等工具，它们的名字都来自于我所在的社会的技术词典；我生活在人际关系网中，从我所在的国际象棋俱乐部到美利坚合众国，它们都体现着词的秩序。语言为我的生活提供了社会坐标，并把有意义的事物填充进来。\n\n    日常生活现实是围绕着我身体所处的“此地”（here）和我当下所在的“此时”（now）被组织起来的。这种“此地此时”构成了我对于日常生活现实的注意力焦点，在日常生活中以“此地此时”的方式呈现给我的东西，构成了我意识中的实在之物（realissimum）。然而，日常生活现实并不仅限于这种触手可及的现象，还包括那些不处于“此地此时”的现象。这就意味着，对我来说，日常生活的各个领域在空间和时间上都会表现出亲疏差异。与我关系最近的，是我的身体可以直接操控的日常生活领域，这一领域包含我能够触及的世界、我可以通过行动来改变其现实的世界以及我工作于其中的世界。在这个运转的世界中，我的意识由一种实用的动机所支配，**也就是说，我对这个世界的注意力是由我正在做什么、做过什么以及想要做什么所决定的**。在这个意义上，它就是我所拥有的最显要的世界。我也知道，日常生活现实还包含着其他一些并不为我直接接触的领域。可是，我对这些领域或者没有实用层面的兴趣，或者仅有间接兴趣（或许它们对我来说是潜在的操控领域）。一般来讲，我对较远的领域的兴趣不会那么强烈，更没有那么迫切。我会对自己的职业所涉及的一连串事物表现出强烈的兴趣。假如我是一个机车工，我就会非常关注修理厂的世界。我会关心底特律汽车工厂的测试实验室里所发生的事情。尽管我的关心是间接的（我永远都不可能成为实验室的一员），但那里的工作终将影响我的日常生活。我可能也对肯尼迪火箭发射场甚至是外太空的事情有兴趣，但这种兴趣是一种私人的、闲暇时的选择，并不属于日常生活中的紧迫之事。\n\n    进一步来讲，在我面前， 日常生活现实是一个主体间的世界，一个由我与他人分享的世界。这种主体间性（intersubjectiviy）将日常生活现实与我所意识到的其他现实鲜明地区分开来。在梦的世界中我只有一个人，但我知道，如同对我一样，日常生活世界对其他人来说是真实的。实际上，如果缺少了与他人的持续互动和沟通，我根本无法存在于日常生活中。我知道我和他人对这个世界的自然态度是一致的，他人也都理解那些为世界带来秩序的客观事物，他们也围绕着自己所处的“此地此时＂来组织这个世界，并在其中做着自己的事情。我当然也明白，对于这个共同的世界，他人有着与我不一样的视角。我的“此地”是他人的“彼地”，我的“此时”也不与他人完全重合。我所做的事情与别人不同，甚至有可能发生冲突。可是我依然清楚，我和他人生活在一个共同的世界里。更重要的是，我还知道一点:我和他人对世界的理解一直保持着某种一致性，因为我们共享着关于现实的一种常识。自然态度是一种常识态度，这恰恰是因为它指向的是许多人的共同世界。**所谓常识性知识，指的是在常态的、不证自明的例行生活中，由我和他人所共享的那些知识。**\n\n    日常生活现实是理所当然的，它简单地存在着，并不需要额外的论证。它就在那儿，不证自明，是一种不可抗拒的事实，我知道它是真实的。虽然我有能力去质疑它的真实性，但在日常生活中，我必须把这种质疑悬置起来。这种悬置是非常坚定的，如果要放弃它，就好比我在理论思考或宗教冥想中所做的那样，我就得经历一种极端的切换。**日常生活具有自我宣示性**，当我试图挑战它时，就不得不费心劳神。哲学家或科学家在从自然态度切换到理论态度时就要经历这样的过程。不过，我们也不能说日常生活现实的所有方面都是没问题的，它们并不是无差别的。日常生活可以被分成许多部分，其中一些是我理解的常规事物，而另一些就会给我带来这样那样的问题。假设我是一个汽车修理师对所有美国产的汽车都很了解，与美国车打交道是我生活中平常无奇的事情。突然有一天，一个人来到修车厂，让我帮他修理他的大众脾汽车，这时我就不得不进入一个由外国车构成的问题世界了。修理这辆大众车时，我有可能不太情感，也有可能带着职业好奇心，但无论怎样，我都遭遇了一种非常规问题。当然，此时我并没有脱离日常生活现实。事实上，在我掌握了修理外国汽车所需要的知识和技能后，我的日常生活现实变得更丰富了。日常生活现实包含常规和存疑两个部分，只要那些存疑的部分不属于一种完全不同的另类现实（如理论物理或噩梦），只要常规的日常生活持续存在，不被打断，人们就不会觉得它们有什么问题。\n\n    然而，即便是日常生活现实中那些目前不成问题的部分，也有可能突然被问题打断。在这种情况下，日常生活现实会努力将有问题的部分整合进无问题的部分。常识性知识中就包含许多这方面的例子。当我的同事忙着他们自己熟悉的事情，做着手边的日常工作时，我不会觉得有什么问题，比方说他们正坐在我旁边的座位上噼里啪啦地打字。可如果他们中断了日常工作，聚到一个小角落窃窃私语，我就会产生疑问了。当我试图揣测这一不同寻常的行为有何意义时，常识会给出多种有助于把不正常重新融入正常的可能解释:他们也许在讨论如何修理一个发生了故障的打字机，或者他们中的某个人从老板那里得到了什么紧急指示，等等。另一方面，我也有可能发现他们正在讨论工会的罢工通知，这算是超出了我的经验，但仍然是一个能够为我的常识所处理的问题。在这里，常识会把它当成一个问题，而不是像前面的情形中那样，将其简单整合进日常生活的无问题领域。然而，要是我得出结论，同事们集体发疯了，问题就具有另外一个性质了。此时我所面对的问题超出了日常生活现实的边界，指向了一个完全不同的现实。事实上，按照我所得出的结论，这些发疯的同事其实已经离开了日常生活世界，进入了另一个世界。\n\n19. 同日常生活现实相比，其他类型的现实仅以**有限意义域**（finite provinces of maning）的面目出现。它们是至尊现实的飞地（enclaves），有着限定好的意义和经验模式。至尊现实全方位地包裹着其他现实，其他现实中的意识不断回溯到至尊现实中，就像是从远游中归来一样。这一点可以在前面所说的梦境和理论思考这两种现实中得到佐证。类似的“穿梭”（commutations）也发生在日常生活世界和游戏世界之间，孩子在游戏时便是如此，成人则更加显著。剧院就为成人的游戏表现提供了一个很好的例子。随着大幕的开合，人们在不同的现实之间进行切换。当大幕拉开时，观众被运送到另一个世界，这个世界有它自己的意义和秩序。这种秩序与日常生活中的秩序既有可能有很多联系，也有可能没什么联系。当大幕闭合，观众“回到现实”，也就是日常生活的至尊现实中。与之相比，舞台上的“现实”变的虚无缥缈、转瞬即逝，尽管在一小会儿之前它还是那么的生动、鲜活。\n\n20. **时间性是意识的内在属性。**意识流总是在一定的时序中展开。社会生活的主体间也带有时间维度。比如“等待”，必须等待膝盖痊愈才能参赛。日常生活的时间结构对我来说是一种必须估量的现实；也就是说，我需要尽量使自己所做之事与其同步。时间的限制性决定了我在等待某事时的焦急程度。时间结构也具有强制性，比如刚好在革命发生之前上学，会严重影响后面的一生。\n\n21. 在面对面的情境中，我与对方共享着一个生动的当下，对方身处其中，“共现”在我的面前。在面对面的情境中，他人是完全真实的。在面对面的情境中，我与他人的关系保持着高度的灵活度。在面对面的情境中，我也会也会通过“类型化图式”来理解他人，当然这种类型化图式是双向的，也带有原生的匿名性。\n\n22. **人的表现性可以被客体化，也就是说，它通过人类活动的产品展现自己。**比如，在现实世界中，武器始终象征着一种使用暴力的泛化意向，因为武器既是人类的产品，也是人类主体性的一种客体化。有一种特殊但极其重要的客体化，这就是符号化，比如语言，声音，手势，符号。\n\n23，**我的日常知识具有关联结构（relevance structure）。它们中的一部分由我个人直接的实用旨趣所决定，另一部分由我在社会中的大体位置所决定。**\n\n24. **我在日常生活中所接触的知识都经过了社会的分配**，也就是说，不同的个体和不同类型的人会拥有不同的知识。我不可能拥有与他人完全一样的知识，有些知识可能只有我自己才拥有:我和同事而非家人共享着专业知识，而只有我自己才知道打牌时如何作弊。\n\n25. 对一个孩子来说，语言属于事物的内在本性，他无法把握语言的“习俗”特征。一个事物就是它的名称，它不能被叫作别的东西。所有的制度都以这样的方式出现。它们是给定的、不变的和自证的。实际情况下，绝大对数父母所传递的制度世界本身就是带有历史性和客观性的事实，而制度的传承过程加强了父母的制度现实感。\n\n26. 社会的整体秩序可以被想象成一个小宇宙，它是上帝按大宇宙的样子造出来的。无论“下面”发生了什么，都只不过是“上面”所发生的事情的苍白投影。\n\n27. 然而只要“陌生的东西”突破了界限，本来偏常的世界也成了自己人的一种彼岸时，麻烦就会出现了。到了这个时候，传统的专家就很可能要召唤“火与剑”了。\n\n28. 一方面，人是一个身体，这一点同样适用于其他动物；另一方面，人有一个身体，也就是说，人感受到自己是一个实体（ entity），但这一实体不等同于身体，因为它反过来能支配身体。换句话说，人对自己的体验总是徘徊在“是身体”和“有身体”的平衡之间，这一平衡需要一次又一次地接受校正。\n\n29. 社会秩序是人类的产品，或者更准确地说，是一种持续生成的人类产品，人类在持续的外化过程中，将其制造出来。**\n\n30. 所有人类活动都有可能被惯例化（ habitualization）。任何一种行动在被不断重复后都会被铸成一种模式（pattern），人们可以不费力地进行复制。在人们眼中，它就是模式。它为人们提供了一个稳定的背景。在这个背景中，人类活动在大多数时候只需最小的决定成本，从而节省了力气，而在某些特定场合下做出同样的决定时，这种力气是节省不了的。\n","source":"_posts/《现实的社会构建》摘录一.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

我们对知识社会的性质和范围的重新定义将把它从社会学理论的边缘移至中心……在这条研究道路上，我们紧紧跟随着的，恰恰是社会学领域最著名和最优影响力的两个“行军号”。它们分别是**涂尔干的《社会学方法准则》**和**韦伯的《经济与社会》**。涂尔干告诉我们：**“最基本和最首要的原则是：把社会事实视为物。”**，韦伯则观察到：**“行动的主观意识丛结是历史和当前社会学的认识对象。”**。\n\n4. 在本书中，给出的定义。“现实”是某些现象的属性，这些现象都是独立于人、不以人的意志为转移的（我们不能凭主观愿望使其消失）；“知识”则是一种确定性，它确证了某些现象是真的并且包含一些基本特征。社会学对“现实”和“知识”的理解介于普通人和哲学家之间。对于普通人，“现实”和“知识”是一些理所当然的东西。对于社会学家来说，“现实”和“知识”在不同的社会中有着很大差别，需要依据学科逻辑来进行思考。对于哲学家，执着于关于世界的可靠判断和不可靠判断，以此来决定何处不用加引号，何处需要加引号。\n\n5. **“知识社会学”不仅事关人类社会的“知识”在经验上所表现出的多样性，而且事关一切“知识”在成为“现实”时所经历的社会过程。**\n\n6. 知识社会学直接的思想来源还要归属于19世纪德国思想的三大发展：**马克思主义**、**尼采哲学**和**历史主义**。\n\n7. 知识社会学从马克思那里获得了它的基础命题：**人们的社会存在决定人们的意识**。对于马克思提出来的“下层结构/上层结构”，也许简单的理解为经济决定论是一种机械而非辩证的误解。也许该理解为，“下层结构”理解为人类活动，“上层结构”理解为人类活动创造出的世界。\n\n8. **尼采认为：思想乃是人类谋求生存和权力的工具**。通过剖析“欺骗”和“自欺”的社会意义，并把“假象”视为生活的必要条件，尼采提出了自己的“虚假意识论”。尼采在知识社会学最主要的著作是《道德的谱系》和《权力意志》。\n\n9. 以威廉·狄尔泰(Wilhelm Dilthey)的作品为代表的历史主义是知识社会学的前身。历史主义重在强调，关于人类事务的所有看法都被相对性笼罩，**人类思想具有不可避免的历史性**。\n\n10. 舍勒强调，人类知识在社会中是以先验的形式呈现的，它先于个人经验并为其提供意义秩序。这一秩序尽管与特定的社会——历史情景有关，但对个体来说是一种看待世界的自然方式。这一秩序被称为“相对化的自然世界观”。\n\n11. 曼海姆最为关注意识形态这一现象。他将意识形态划分为特定的、总体的和普遍的三种类型:特定的意识形态指向对立者的部分观念；总体的意识形态指向对立者的整个观念体系（类似于马克思所说的“虚假意识”）；普遍的意识形态不仅包括我们的对立者，而且包括我们自己的观念，而曼海姆认为，正是在这一点上，马克思被超越了。普遍的意识形态主张所有人类思想（除了上文提到的一些例外）都受其所在社会背景的意识形态影响，这个思路就到达了知识社会学的层次。通过这种扩充，曼海姆试图将意识形态理论的核心问题从政治用语的情境中抽离出来，将其转化为更具普遍意义的认识论和历史社会学问题。\n\n12. 知识社会学必须关注社会中所有被当作“知识”的事物。**在一个社会中，虽然只有少数人关心对于世界的理论解释，但是所有人都生活在某种世界中。**\n\n13. **日常生活现实是理所当然的，它简单地存在着，并不需要额外的论证。它就在那儿，不证自明，是一种不可抗拒的事实，我知道它是真实的。**\n\n14. 当我因为某些原因在日常生活的时间结构中“迷失”之时，我会几近本能地寻求“重新定向”。我会看看手表，尝试记起今天是什么日子，借助这些行为来重回日常生活现实。\n\n15. **语义场**决定了个人和社会的总体经验中哪些被保存、哪些被遗忘。通过这种积累，一个社会知识库就形成了，它代代相传，被日常生活中的个人所继承。\n\n16. **意识总具有意向性**，它永远包含着意图或直接指向对象。我们永远不可能把握住某些所谓的意识本身的内在基质（substratum），而只能讨论关于某物的意识。不管意识的对象是关于外在物质世界的经验，还是对于主观现实元素的理解，都不例外。当“我”（第一人称单数，在此处及下面的讨论中均表示日常生活中的一般化的自我意识）俯瞰纽约全景或是当“我”意识到内心的焦虑时，意识过程都带有意向性。\n\n17. 在人的意识中，不同的对象组成了不同领域的现实。**在“我”眼中，日常生活中需要打交道的人与梦境中的虚幻人物分属于不同的现实**。\n\n18. 在各种现实中，有一种现实最为突出，这就是日常生活现实，它的特殊地位使它获得了至尊现实（paramount reality）的称号。在日常生活中，意识最为紧张，因为日常生活以一种最沉重、最紧迫和最强烈的方式将自己置于意识之上。要忽视它是不可能的，即便要削弱它的显著性都非常困难。因此，日常生活的现实迫使我必须全力投入其中。**我在完全清醒的状态下体验日常生活，我完全清醒地认识到，自己存在于日常生活的现实之中，并且我也理解它。**这种清醒状态对我来说是正常的和自明的，它构成了我的自然态度。\n\n    对我来说，日常生活现实是井然有序的，它的现象遵从一些提前安排好的模式。这些模式外在于我对它们的理解，并且凌驾于这种理解之上。日常生活现实看上去已然是客观化的，它的组成分是一系列在我出场之前就已存在的客体。**日常语言为我持续提供必要的客观化**，设定好一种秩序。这种秩序既使客观化变得合理，也使我体验到日常生活的意义。我生活在一个具有确切地理位置的地方；我使用开瓶器和跑车等工具，它们的名字都来自于我所在的社会的技术词典；我生活在人际关系网中，从我所在的国际象棋俱乐部到美利坚合众国，它们都体现着词的秩序。语言为我的生活提供了社会坐标，并把有意义的事物填充进来。\n\n    日常生活现实是围绕着我身体所处的“此地”（here）和我当下所在的“此时”（now）被组织起来的。这种“此地此时”构成了我对于日常生活现实的注意力焦点，在日常生活中以“此地此时”的方式呈现给我的东西，构成了我意识中的实在之物（realissimum）。然而，日常生活现实并不仅限于这种触手可及的现象，还包括那些不处于“此地此时”的现象。这就意味着，对我来说，日常生活的各个领域在空间和时间上都会表现出亲疏差异。与我关系最近的，是我的身体可以直接操控的日常生活领域，这一领域包含我能够触及的世界、我可以通过行动来改变其现实的世界以及我工作于其中的世界。在这个运转的世界中，我的意识由一种实用的动机所支配，**也就是说，我对这个世界的注意力是由我正在做什么、做过什么以及想要做什么所决定的**。在这个意义上，它就是我所拥有的最显要的世界。我也知道，日常生活现实还包含着其他一些并不为我直接接触的领域。可是，我对这些领域或者没有实用层面的兴趣，或者仅有间接兴趣（或许它们对我来说是潜在的操控领域）。一般来讲，我对较远的领域的兴趣不会那么强烈，更没有那么迫切。我会对自己的职业所涉及的一连串事物表现出强烈的兴趣。假如我是一个机车工，我就会非常关注修理厂的世界。我会关心底特律汽车工厂的测试实验室里所发生的事情。尽管我的关心是间接的（我永远都不可能成为实验室的一员），但那里的工作终将影响我的日常生活。我可能也对肯尼迪火箭发射场甚至是外太空的事情有兴趣，但这种兴趣是一种私人的、闲暇时的选择，并不属于日常生活中的紧迫之事。\n\n    进一步来讲，在我面前， 日常生活现实是一个主体间的世界，一个由我与他人分享的世界。这种主体间性（intersubjectiviy）将日常生活现实与我所意识到的其他现实鲜明地区分开来。在梦的世界中我只有一个人，但我知道，如同对我一样，日常生活世界对其他人来说是真实的。实际上，如果缺少了与他人的持续互动和沟通，我根本无法存在于日常生活中。我知道我和他人对这个世界的自然态度是一致的，他人也都理解那些为世界带来秩序的客观事物，他们也围绕着自己所处的“此地此时＂来组织这个世界，并在其中做着自己的事情。我当然也明白，对于这个共同的世界，他人有着与我不一样的视角。我的“此地”是他人的“彼地”，我的“此时”也不与他人完全重合。我所做的事情与别人不同，甚至有可能发生冲突。可是我依然清楚，我和他人生活在一个共同的世界里。更重要的是，我还知道一点:我和他人对世界的理解一直保持着某种一致性，因为我们共享着关于现实的一种常识。自然态度是一种常识态度，这恰恰是因为它指向的是许多人的共同世界。**所谓常识性知识，指的是在常态的、不证自明的例行生活中，由我和他人所共享的那些知识。**\n\n    日常生活现实是理所当然的，它简单地存在着，并不需要额外的论证。它就在那儿，不证自明，是一种不可抗拒的事实，我知道它是真实的。虽然我有能力去质疑它的真实性，但在日常生活中，我必须把这种质疑悬置起来。这种悬置是非常坚定的，如果要放弃它，就好比我在理论思考或宗教冥想中所做的那样，我就得经历一种极端的切换。**日常生活具有自我宣示性**，当我试图挑战它时，就不得不费心劳神。哲学家或科学家在从自然态度切换到理论态度时就要经历这样的过程。不过，我们也不能说日常生活现实的所有方面都是没问题的，它们并不是无差别的。日常生活可以被分成许多部分，其中一些是我理解的常规事物，而另一些就会给我带来这样那样的问题。假设我是一个汽车修理师对所有美国产的汽车都很了解，与美国车打交道是我生活中平常无奇的事情。突然有一天，一个人来到修车厂，让我帮他修理他的大众脾汽车，这时我就不得不进入一个由外国车构成的问题世界了。修理这辆大众车时，我有可能不太情感，也有可能带着职业好奇心，但无论怎样，我都遭遇了一种非常规问题。当然，此时我并没有脱离日常生活现实。事实上，在我掌握了修理外国汽车所需要的知识和技能后，我的日常生活现实变得更丰富了。日常生活现实包含常规和存疑两个部分，只要那些存疑的部分不属于一种完全不同的另类现实（如理论物理或噩梦），只要常规的日常生活持续存在，不被打断，人们就不会觉得它们有什么问题。\n\n    然而，即便是日常生活现实中那些目前不成问题的部分，也有可能突然被问题打断。在这种情况下，日常生活现实会努力将有问题的部分整合进无问题的部分。常识性知识中就包含许多这方面的例子。当我的同事忙着他们自己熟悉的事情，做着手边的日常工作时，我不会觉得有什么问题，比方说他们正坐在我旁边的座位上噼里啪啦地打字。可如果他们中断了日常工作，聚到一个小角落窃窃私语，我就会产生疑问了。当我试图揣测这一不同寻常的行为有何意义时，常识会给出多种有助于把不正常重新融入正常的可能解释:他们也许在讨论如何修理一个发生了故障的打字机，或者他们中的某个人从老板那里得到了什么紧急指示，等等。另一方面，我也有可能发现他们正在讨论工会的罢工通知，这算是超出了我的经验，但仍然是一个能够为我的常识所处理的问题。在这里，常识会把它当成一个问题，而不是像前面的情形中那样，将其简单整合进日常生活的无问题领域。然而，要是我得出结论，同事们集体发疯了，问题就具有另外一个性质了。此时我所面对的问题超出了日常生活现实的边界，指向了一个完全不同的现实。事实上，按照我所得出的结论，这些发疯的同事其实已经离开了日常生活世界，进入了另一个世界。\n\n19. 同日常生活现实相比，其他类型的现实仅以**有限意义域**（finite provinces of maning）的面目出现。它们是至尊现实的飞地（enclaves），有着限定好的意义和经验模式。至尊现实全方位地包裹着其他现实，其他现实中的意识不断回溯到至尊现实中，就像是从远游中归来一样。这一点可以在前面所说的梦境和理论思考这两种现实中得到佐证。类似的“穿梭”（commutations）也发生在日常生活世界和游戏世界之间，孩子在游戏时便是如此，成人则更加显著。剧院就为成人的游戏表现提供了一个很好的例子。随着大幕的开合，人们在不同的现实之间进行切换。当大幕拉开时，观众被运送到另一个世界，这个世界有它自己的意义和秩序。这种秩序与日常生活中的秩序既有可能有很多联系，也有可能没什么联系。当大幕闭合，观众“回到现实”，也就是日常生活的至尊现实中。与之相比，舞台上的“现实”变的虚无缥缈、转瞬即逝，尽管在一小会儿之前它还是那么的生动、鲜活。\n\n20. **时间性是意识的内在属性。**意识流总是在一定的时序中展开。社会生活的主体间也带有时间维度。比如“等待”，必须等待膝盖痊愈才能参赛。日常生活的时间结构对我来说是一种必须估量的现实；也就是说，我需要尽量使自己所做之事与其同步。时间的限制性决定了我在等待某事时的焦急程度。时间结构也具有强制性，比如刚好在革命发生之前上学，会严重影响后面的一生。\n\n21. 在面对面的情境中，我与对方共享着一个生动的当下，对方身处其中，“共现”在我的面前。在面对面的情境中，他人是完全真实的。在面对面的情境中，我与他人的关系保持着高度的灵活度。在面对面的情境中，我也会也会通过“类型化图式”来理解他人，当然这种类型化图式是双向的，也带有原生的匿名性。\n\n22. **人的表现性可以被客体化，也就是说，它通过人类活动的产品展现自己。**比如，在现实世界中，武器始终象征着一种使用暴力的泛化意向，因为武器既是人类的产品，也是人类主体性的一种客体化。有一种特殊但极其重要的客体化，这就是符号化，比如语言，声音，手势，符号。\n\n23，**我的日常知识具有关联结构（relevance structure）。它们中的一部分由我个人直接的实用旨趣所决定，另一部分由我在社会中的大体位置所决定。**\n\n24. **我在日常生活中所接触的知识都经过了社会的分配**，也就是说，不同的个体和不同类型的人会拥有不同的知识。我不可能拥有与他人完全一样的知识，有些知识可能只有我自己才拥有:我和同事而非家人共享着专业知识，而只有我自己才知道打牌时如何作弊。\n\n25. 对一个孩子来说，语言属于事物的内在本性，他无法把握语言的“习俗”特征。一个事物就是它的名称，它不能被叫作别的东西。所有的制度都以这样的方式出现。它们是给定的、不变的和自证的。实际情况下，绝大对数父母所传递的制度世界本身就是带有历史性和客观性的事实，而制度的传承过程加强了父母的制度现实感。\n\n26. 社会的整体秩序可以被想象成一个小宇宙，它是上帝按大宇宙的样子造出来的。无论“下面”发生了什么，都只不过是“上面”所发生的事情的苍白投影。\n\n27. 然而只要“陌生的东西”突破了界限，本来偏常的世界也成了自己人的一种彼岸时，麻烦就会出现了。到了这个时候，传统的专家就很可能要召唤“火与剑”了。\n\n28. 一方面，人是一个身体，这一点同样适用于其他动物；另一方面，人有一个身体，也就是说，人感受到自己是一个实体（ entity），但这一实体不等同于身体，因为它反过来能支配身体。换句话说，人对自己的体验总是徘徊在“是身体”和“有身体”的平衡之间，这一平衡需要一次又一次地接受校正。\n\n29. 社会秩序是人类的产品，或者更准确地说，是一种持续生成的人类产品，人类在持续的外化过程中，将其制造出来。**\n\n30. 所有人类活动都有可能被惯例化（ habitualization）。任何一种行动在被不断重复后都会被铸成一种模式（pattern），人们可以不费力地进行复制。在人们眼中，它就是模式。它为人们提供了一个稳定的背景。在这个背景中，人类活动在大多数时候只需最小的决定成本，从而节省了力气，而在某些特定场合下做出同样的决定时，这种力气是节省不了的。\n","slug":"《现实的社会构建》摘录一","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.502Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vksh003kpmnkgu815j17","content":"<ol

测这一不同寻常的行为有何意义时，常识会给出多种有助于把不正常重新融入正常的可能解释:他们也许在讨论如何修理一个发生了故障的打字机，或者他们中的某个人从老板那里得到了什么紧急指示，等等。另一方面，我也有可能发现他们正在讨论工会的罢工通知，这算是超出了我的经验，但仍然是一个能够为我的常识所处理的问题。在这里，常识会把它当成一个问题，而不是像前面的情形中那样，将其简单整合进日常生活的无问题领域。然而，要是我得出结论，同事们集体发疯了，问题就具有另外一个性质了。此时我所面对的问题超出了日常生活现实的边界，指向了一个完全不同的现实。事实上，按照我所得出的结论，这些发疯的同事其实已经离开了日常生活世界，进入了另一个世界。</p></li>\n<li><p>同日常生活现实相比，其他类型的现实仅以<strong>有限意义域</strong>（finite\nprovinces of\nmaning）的面目出现。它们是至尊现实的飞地（enclaves），有着限定好的意义和经验模式。至尊现实全方位地包裹着其他现实，其他现实中的意识不断回溯到至尊现实中，就像是从远游中归来一样。这一点可以在前面所说的梦境和理论思考这两种现实中得到佐证。类似的“穿梭”（commutations）也发生在日常生活世界和游戏世界之间，孩子在游戏时便是如此，成人则更加显著。剧院就为成人的游戏表现提供了一个很好的例子。随着大幕的开合，人们在不同的现实之间进行切换。当大幕拉开时，观众被运送到另一个世界，这个世界有它自己的意义和秩序。这种秩序与日常生活中的秩序既有可能有很多联系，也有可能没什么联系。当大幕闭合，观众“回到现实”，也就是日常生活的至尊现实中。与之相比，舞台上的“现实”变的虚无缥缈、转瞬即逝，尽管在一小会儿之前它还是那么的生动、鲜活。</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>时间性是意识的内在属性。</strong>意识流总是在一定的时序中展开。社会生活的主体间也带有时间维度。比如“等待”，必须等待膝盖痊愈才能参赛。日常生活的时间结构对我来说是一种必须估量的现实；也就是说，我需要尽量使自己所做之事与其同步。时间的限制性决定了我在等待某事时的焦急程度。时间结构也具有强制性，比如刚好在革命发生之前上学，会严重影响后面的一生。</p></li>\n<li><p>在面对面的情境中，我与对方共享着一个生动的当下，对方身处其中，“共现”在我的面前。在面对面的情境中，他人是完全真实的。在面对面的情境中，我与他人的关系保持着高度的灵活度。在面对面的情境中，我也会也会通过“类型化图式”来理解他人，当然这种类型化图式是双向的，也带有原生的匿名性。</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>人的表现性可以被客体化，也就是说，它通过人类活动的产品展现自己。</strong>比如，在现实世界中，武器始终象征着一种使用暴力的泛化意向，因为武器既是人类的产品，也是人类主体性的一种客体化。有一种特殊但极其重要的客体化，这就是符号化，比如语言，声音，手势，符号。</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>23，<strong>我的日常知识具有关联结构（relevance\nstructure）。它们中的一部分由我个人直接的实用旨趣所决定，另一部分由我在社会中的大体位置所决定。</strong></p>\n<ol

危机 - 第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 60\n新的成功者既不是资本家也不是普通劳动者，而是受过良好教育、拥有新技能的人。他们组成了一个新阶层，他们在大学里相遇，形成新的共同身份，基于技能对彼此心怀尊重。他们甚至形成了一种独特的道德，将少数族裔、性取向等特征上升为群体身份，将其视为受害者。他们宣称只有自己关心受害者群体，从而对受教育程度低于自己的人主张道德优势。受过良好教育的人组成了一个新的统治阶层，比以往任何时候都更信任政府并彼此信任。\n<!--more-->\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 74\n调查显示，年轻人空前悲观：大多数年轻人觉得自己未来的生活水准将低于父母的。这并不是错觉：过去 40年来，资本主义的经济表现不断恶化。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 94\n大自然厌恶真空，选民也一样。现实与可能性之间的鸿沟导致的挫折感为两种伺机而动的政客提供了动力——民粹主义者和意识形态分子。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 100\n意识形态提供了一种诱人的组合，简单的道德确定性和无所不能的分析，能够为任何问题提供自信的答案。几种复兴的意识形态，诸如 20世纪的法西斯主义和 17世纪的宗教原教旨主义，都曾引诱着社会走向悲剧。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 107\n克里斯马式的民粹主义者。民粹主义者连意识形态的粗略分析也不做，直接跳向只有两分钟说服力的解决方案。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 168\n事实很快就证明，以机械的方式从个体的“效用”出发，推论出关于社会福祉的理论，是无论如何也达不到理论连贯性的基本标准的。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 195\n成功者意识不到普通人的焦虑。功利主义先锋相信自己才德兼备，凭着这样的自信，他们毫不迟疑地自视为当代的柏拉图“卫国者”，有权否定其他人的价值观。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 204\n自由至上主义者（ Libertarians）把权利归还给了个人，但没有把义务归还给个人。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 211\n最初争取包容的运动（也许不经意地）变得僵化，演化出相互对立的群体身份，人们通过设想某个敌对群体来激发斗志。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 221\n功利主义者、罗尔斯主义者和自由至上主义者都强调个人而非集体；\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 222\n功利主义经济学家要求按需求进行再分配；逐渐地，福利制度被重新设计，以使权利与贡献不再相关，在此过程中，公平这一常规的人类价值被摒弃。没有做出过贡献的人比做出过贡献的人更受优待。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 228\n这两种意识形态都摒弃互惠与应得性的常规道德本能，抬高一个单一的理性原则（尽管二者的理性内涵内容不同），并主张由专家组成的先锋队来将这项原则强加于社会。而合作运动是建立在那些常规道德本能之上的，\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 232\n当左派知识分子放弃实践性社群主义的社会民主主义，转奉功利主义与罗尔斯主义的意识形态时，中右翼政党要么僵化地怀旧，在思想方面无所建树，要么被另一群同样误入歧途的知识分子所俘获。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 237\n新经济学说结盟。该派学说认为，追求自身利益的自由在仅受竞争制约的情况下能产生比公共监管和规划更好的结果。该学说为罗纳德·里根（ Ronald Reagan）和玛格丽特·撒切尔（ Margaret Thatcher）的政策革命奠定了思想基础。尽管左右派的新意识形态呈现出截然对立的面貌，但它们都强调个人，并推崇精英统治：左派推崇的道德优越的精英与右派推崇的经济能力优越的精英竞争。左派眼中的超级明星是很有德行的人，右派眼中的超级明星则是极为富有的人。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 250\n公共选择理论认识到，公共政策决定通常不是由超然的圣人做出的，而是通过平衡包括官僚集团自身在内的不同利益集团的诉求而形成的。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 287\n克罗斯兰是一位实用主义者：评价某种政策要看其是否行之有效，而非是否符合某种意识形态的信条。实用主义哲学的一项核心主张是，因为社会在不断变化，所以我们不应期待有永恒的真理。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 306\n对大多数人来说，人际关系对生活有根本性的意义，而人际关系必然涉及义务。至关重要的是，人们会做出互惠性承诺，这是社群的根本要素。自私与互惠性义务之间的斗争，即个人主义与社群之间的斗争，在三种主导人类生活的组织中展开：国家、企业和家庭。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 337\n因为没有更好的术语，我姑且把我提出的这些弥合分歧的政策统称为“社会母爱主义”（ social maternalism）。我主张政府在经济和社会领域发挥积极作用，但政府不能公然给自己授权。政府的税收政策应遏制强者攫取其不应得的收益，但不能热衷于把富人的收入分给穷人。政府监管应赋予“创造性破坏”（竞争驱动经济进步的过程）中的受损者索取补偿的权利，而不能试图阻挠这个赋予资本主义惊人活力的进程本身。政府倡导的爱国主义应当具有凝聚力，取代对支离破碎的受害者身份认同的强调。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 342\n我不是指把一堆杂乱的观点拼凑在一起，而是指要接受人们多样化和本能的价值观，并接受基于这种多样性而做出的务实取舍。诉诸某种单一的绝对原则，使其凌驾于各种价值观之上，这种做法注定会导致分裂。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 351\n在《国家挑战》（ The Fix）一书中，乔纳森·泰珀曼（ Jonathan Tepperman）研究了十位这样的领导人，\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 352\n他们的共同点是避开意识形态，专注于针对核心问题寻找务实的解决方案，并根据情况的变化进行调整。[\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 360\n务实的中间派”\n\n第二部分 重建道德- 第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 400\n在他们看来，资本主义有一个致命的污点：它依赖贪婪这个唯一的驱动力。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 432\n斯密在他的书中重点关注的情感：温和的压力，如羞耻和尊重，促使我们交换义务——如果你愿意帮助我，我就愿意帮助你。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 442\n人既受《国富论》中描述的“愿望”驱动，也受《道德情操论》中描述的“义务”驱动。无论愿望还是义务，斯密都认为，从自给自足到互相交易的转变是革命性的，但他自己似乎认为《道德情操论》更重要，义务的交易比愿望的交易更重要。“\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 454\n道德源于价值观而非理性。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 457\n叫做“动机性推理”的假象。理性基于价值观，而不是价值观基于理性，或者正如斯密那句形象的话：“理性是激情的奴隶。”\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 459\n《理性之谜》（ The Enigma of Reason）\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 461\n理性本身是为说服他人而进化出来的，而不是为了改进我们自己的决策。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 463\n过去 200年间人类大脑的大规模扩容是由社交需求驱动的。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 473\n实用主义拒绝意识形态，没有一种价值观是至高无上、绝对和永恒的。\n\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 484\n实用主义者承认这些局限性：个体的道德判断是可能出错的。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 487\n有些政治哲学家对个体的实践理性能力极度怀疑，他们看重蓄积在制度里的智慧，这是保守主义。有些政治哲学家信任个体的理性，且看重其带来的自由，这是自由主义。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 497\n千万年来，人类唯有通过群体合作才能生存，单干就意味着死亡。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 507\n我们不是从自身推导出世界，而是从所处的世界推导出自身。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 545\n归属感、义务和因果关系，这三种叙事结合在一起，形成一张互惠义务之网。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 556\n但信念体系也有一种不可估量的好处：它将自私的“经济人”变成以义务为驱动力的人，他们自视为某个团体的一分子，\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 573\n人群就是环境，人们演化是为了相互适应。一个社会的起点决定了它的终点，在演化过程中，初始差异被放大。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 608\n已经把全世界联系在一起的“硅谷”巨头们想象，他们正在通过这种方式开启一个团结在其自由至上主义价值观周围的全球社会。这是很难实现的。连接人与人的新技术正在取代偶然地由地域决定的人类网络化群体（地方社会或国家）。新的电子网络群体的成员，其身份是基于自我的选择而非偶然形成的：在“回音室”里，人们更喜欢与观点一致者建立联系。[ 25]在该过程中，叙事创造信念，信念与人们共同生活的空间日益脱节。但我们的政治单位依然是由我们的居住地决定的。我们的选票是按地域划区计票的，源于政治的公共服务和政策是按地域提供和适用的。所以，之前导致不同政体之间的规范存在巨大差异的过程，在新技术带来的地域连通性下，正在导致各政体内部出现巨大的规范差异。政体内的观念变得更加两极分化；分歧更容易转化为人身攻击；几百年来导致政体之间对立的仇恨，正在每个政体内部导致信念体系的对立。历史上政体之间的仇恨演变为大规模的有组织暴力。政体内部的仇恨将产生不同结果，但同样可能是令人悲伤的。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 648\n亚当·斯密所接受的经济学的坚实基础是承认非互惠性的利他主义只限于援救义务：这不足以对抗利己主义。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 649\n归属感、义务与目的性行动的叙事结合\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 698\n一种符合特定标准的道德资本主义，这种标准建立在我们价值观之上，经过了实践理性的磨砺，而且社会本身可以再生。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 712\n权利意味着义务，但义务不一定意味着权利。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 728\n当我们承认对他人负有的新义务时，我们的社会更有希望实现繁荣；当我们忽视这些义务时，社会便会远离繁荣。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 776\n将良好理念与道德目标联系在一起的国家总会创造奇迹。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 791\n新的焦虑植根于经济差异。繁荣的大都市和衰败的中小城市之间的地域差距正在扩大；一道不断拉大的鸿沟两个群体分隔开来，一边是拥有受人尊重和富有成就感的工作的人，另一边是职业前景黯淡甚至失业的人。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 797\n但如果国家试图将一套迥异的价值观强加给它的公民，就会失去国民信任，权威也会受损。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 798\n随着社会分裂的加剧，人们愈发不愿宽宏地对待裂痕另一边的人了。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 810\n社会民主主义\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 832\n“理性经济人”\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 834\n“理性社会人”\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 842\n综上所述，每个人有四个获得尊重的来源。一是我们的工作，二是我们的国籍，三是我们选择突出哪个身份，四是与像我们一样选择突出该身份的人组成的群体。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 863\n整个过程中，所有人只是在努力把自己获得的尊重最大化。但由于经济的结构性变化，一道裂痕出现了。高技能水平者把突出的身份改成了自己的工作。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 879\n帮助他人的意愿是通过结合三种叙事而产生的：对一个群体的共同归属感；群体内部的互惠义务；行为与群体幸福之间的联系，这种联系表明行为是有目的的。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 902\n如果我们相信自己能预测他人的行为，我们就会信任他人。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 911\n在一个复杂的社会中，密布的关系网络依赖于信任。因此，当信任崩溃时，合作也开始瓦解。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 918\n人们警惕共同的国家认同，这是可以理解的，毕竟民族主义曾造成可怕的后果。所有身份认同都隐含排他性，但如果它做出明确、敌对的排他性规定则是有害的。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 934\n现代繁荣社会中的人是在权力已经转化为权威的环境里长大的，所以把这视为理所当然。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 947\n所有这些看似各不相同的分离运动都有一个共同点：它们都涉及一国内的富裕地区试图摆脱对其余地区所负的义务。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 964\n随着遵守义务行为的减少，权利变得无法实现，人们对政府的信任度下滑。这是席卷西方各国的强烈趋势。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 989\n残酷的现实是，公共政策的场域必然是“空间性”的。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1000\n从公共政策角度看，处在同一空间里的人是一体的，但从社会角度看却已经不再是这样了。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1000\n空间性社群在遭受两方面的冲击：作为替代性社群的网络回音室，以及更彻底地避开面对面交流、\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1001\n沉入焦虑性自恋的孤立状态。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1013\n民族主义者\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1027\n归属、乡土与爱国主义\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1028\n为了使每个人都能幸福，一个社会需要一种强烈的共同身份认同。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1073\n基于地方的身份认同是在进化中形成的人类心灵深处最根深蒂固的特征之一，不属于那些相对较晚时因使用语言而形成的软性价值观。基于地方的身份认同不仅根深蒂固，而且很强烈。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1080\n叙事促进记忆，这让我们把家乡不仅仅视为其当前的样貌，还视为一个演变的过程：我们对家乡城市所经历的重重变化的理解，增强了我们对当前眼中的这座城市的归属感。\n\n 第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1109\n显然，在战争时期，绝大多数关于目的性行为的叙事意味着共同利益，因此能强化共同身份；\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1111\n而对立身份对社会是有害的。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1112\n宣扬利益对立的每个叙事孤立地看都有可能是对的，但这些叙事累积起来就具有很大的破坏性，导致集体福祉恶化。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1114\n政客一直回避关于共同归属的叙事，无论是关于地域还是目的的，这无意中进一步削弱了父爱主义国家履行职责的能力。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1138\n如果说现代资本主义有一个让人最反感的特征，那就是沉迷于盈利。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1147\n企业经营的目的是履行对客户和员工的义务。盈利不是目标，而是为在可持续基础上实现这些目标而必须满足的条件。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1166\n一家公司需要使命感。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1310\n公共政策出错的原因是陈旧意识形态之间的尖锐斗争导致人们聚焦于不重要的问题。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1311\n右翼意识形态主张信仰“市场”，贬斥所有政策干预，其解决方案是：“政府不要再骑在企业背上，取消监管！”左翼意识形态贬斥资本主义，谴责企业和基金管理者贪得无厌，其解决方案是国家控制企业，将战略经济领域国有化。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1368\n集权使政府不用向国民负责，导致既得利益者猖獗不已，大多数人都明白这一点。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1374\n既得利益者对自身优势的了解远远超过政府官员。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1390\n生产率提升必然意味着经济的复杂性稳步增大，这导致其他产业也出现了一些网络化特征。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1426\n导致国际合作更困难的因素是绝大多数电子科技公司都是美国公司，因此美国政府对国际合作充其量持模棱两可的态度。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1444\n在企业规模越大、生产率与利润越高的行业，规模经济效应带来的额外收益是一种“经济租金”。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1446\n经济学家所说的“经济租金”是指从一项经济活动的收益中除去为吸引劳动者、资金与企业家所需的成本之后的那部分收益。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1490\n幸福并非来自金钱方面的成功。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1527\n道德企业已经被吸血乌贼取代。时代已经改变，需要让它回到从前的样子。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1563\n开明自利支持一种共同身份，共同身份界定了一种具有区别性的互惠性所适用的范围。归属于家庭的共同身份很容易建立，因为它是一种日常生活的现实：“相互尊重”的范围。互惠性承诺的规范是情感的自然延伸，而且使命感能增强这些规范：如果有足够多的人遵从，所有人就能得到长期性的物质利益，这就是“开明的自利”。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1581\n以前被视为需要抵制的诱惑行为，现在被视为需要把握住的自我实现时刻。许多新阶层家庭的夫妻都发现，要想实现自我就必须离婚。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1606\n在日本，养育“用来炫耀的孩子”的压力比西方社会大得多，所以单亲家庭无法和双亲家庭竞争。因此，受教育程度高的日本单身女性更倾向于养宠物，而不是无法让自己感到骄傲的孩子。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1716\n道德家庭的某些方面是权力与欺凌关系的拙劣伪装，扔掉这些东西再好不过。但从中“解放”出来的很多不过是伪装成自我发现的自私。与此类似，一边以功利主义态度关心“全世界的穷人”，一边否认对家庭的责任，这并不是什么道德觉醒，而是为了摆出道德姿态而获得的廉价快感罢了。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1732\n是，经济学领域的一项重大突破表明，“变弱”可能意味着“变强”。一个人也许有必要放弃一些权力，以便做出可信的承诺，并从中获益。能够做出承诺是开明自利的特征。说得花哨点就是一种“责任手段”解决了“时间不一致性问题”。该技术的发现者们获得了诺贝尔奖。\n\n第六章 道德的世界 > 位置 1860\n在其他方面，欧盟仍是一个极有价值的俱乐部，并有潜力发挥更多作用。但是，欧盟已不再是一个大家毫不含糊地相互支持的俱乐部了，而是在日益变成强国指挥其他国家的组织。\n\n第六章 道德的世界 > 位置 1930\n把头脑与爱心结合起来可以指导我们具体应该成立什么样的新的互惠性俱乐部，从而应对迫在眉睫的全球性焦虑，并为需要援救的人提供有效的救助。二战后那一代全球领袖面临的形势远比今天危险，但他们同时实现了这两个目标，送给后人一个虽远算不上完美但却得到显著改善的世界。他们的后继者坐拥这份遗产，却沉溺于意识形态和民粹主义。结果是国际俱乐部弱化，援救义务变味，我们正在为此付出代价。但只要回到实用主义的思路，我们不仅能重建道德世界，而且能使它变得比以往任何时候都更好。\n\n第三部分 重建包容性社会 - 第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 1959\n造成这种新分化的力量是基于两种可追溯到工业革命的简单关系。一是生产率和专业化之间的关系，通常的说法是“在实践中学习”（ learning by doing）。专注于更少任务的人能培养出更高超的技能。二是生产率和规模之间的关系，通常的说法是“规模经济”。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 1972\n1980年代以来，知识经济呈指数增长，其推动力有两个：大学中基础研究的空前增多，以及与此互补的公司中应用研究的增多。利用物质造福人类的潜力仅受到物理基本定律的限制。我们目前还在这个过程的初级阶段，因为复杂的物质世界极难掌握。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 1975\n通过一个个科学发现，我们探索着这个复杂世界，这可能逐渐使生产率发生革命性突破。但人类要凭有限的能力掌握复杂物质世界，唯一途径是让能力最强的人变得越来越专业化。 15世纪之后，再没有人能严肃地表示自己知道所有已知知识了。今天，最聪明的人会抵达某个狭窄领域的知识前沿，形成极为深入的理解，而相应地会远离其他领域的前沿。不仅研究是这样，具有商业价值的技能也是如此。例如，法律越来越复杂，所以不同法律分支变得更精细了。大学的扩张不仅催生研究，而且培养了有能力掌握这类技能的毕业生。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2043\n双方观点中包含的道理仅能说服其追随者，但都不完全正确。右派认识到的道理是，政策目标绝不能是把地方城市变成“福利街”。幸福依赖于尊严和使命感，而不仅仅取决于人的消费能力。用公共福利来补贴没有成就感的工作，这样的策略绝不等同于创造需要特定技能、劳动者掌握该技能后会感到自豪的就业机会。所以，政策目标应该是创造高生产率的就业机会，而不是用公共财政来补贴从事低生产率工作的人。左派认定的道理是，凭借在大都市里的高薪专业工作富得流油又洋洋得意的人，在道德上是令人反感的。这些人认为他们的收入都是应得的，而我将证明不是这回事。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2061\n正如乔纳森·海特发现的，对大多数人来说，公平意味着比例性和应得性，而不是平等。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2070\n亨利·乔治的大胆思想\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2072\n正确的政策是对城市土地的增值部分征税。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2082\n所有集聚经济效益都成了租金，为土地所有者获得。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2105\n亨利·乔治的思想是实践理性的早期应用，讨论的是租金与其他形式的收入在应得性方面的差异。他谨慎地把土地增值产生的租金和资本收益区分开来，认为后者具有道德合法性。他的主张既不属于马克思主义，也不属于民粹主义。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2126\n假想情况一：一个包含有不同技能和不同居住需求的居民的大都市\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2146\n假想情况二：需要法治的大都市\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2168\n大都市的生产率依赖的是整个国家提供的公共品，如法治和已经做出的旨在增强连通性的基础设施投资。这些公共品为所有人都提供了一些好处，但高技能的大都市工作者从中获得了过高的收益。更根本的是，集聚经济效益本质上是由国民集体创造的。是无数工作者的互动，而不仅仅是每一名高薪工作者的独自努力，创造了集聚经济效益。高技能人士有权保留其高生产率产生的一部分收益，但不应该得到全部收益。此外，不在大都市里工作的人，由于其生产率并非在其他人的帮助下提高，他们所应得的份额也不应与大都市里的高技能人士一样多。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2198\n但事实是亨利·乔治定理已经失效。在大都市里，获得大部分集聚经济效益的人是居住需求很小的高技能人士，这意味着大量的寻租机会。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2371\n繁荣城市和破败城市之间的地域分化不是不可避免的；这一现象是晚近发生的，而且是可以逆转的。但靠公共政策的微小调整无法逆转这一趋势。简单地说，小幅调整无济于事，但更根本的问题是，经济发展的空间动力取决于预期：企业选择的经营地是它们预计其他企业将选择的经营地。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2443\n证据表明，人的决策很大程度上受社会网络中其他人观点的影响，这说明家庭和朋友的反应很重要，因为我们都是社会动物。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2559\n现在所有人都能上网，但近期的研究显示，受教育程度高的家庭的孩子学会利用互联网来扩展知识，而低受教育程度家庭的孩子则用互联网来消遣。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2561\n学校可以发生的最有价值的改变是让学校更具有社会融合性。社会融合性的主要障碍是学区。因为人们会根据自己的社会地位高低来选择居住地点，所以学区会导致这种社会分层反映到学校里。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2573\n但最主要的认识是教师的素质远比资金重要。提升教师群体的素质有四个简单的途径：吸引更好的教师加入教学队伍，基于有评估的试验这种实用主义做法来培训教师，让最好的教师投入挑战性最大的地方，淘汰最差的教师。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2597\n人类避免损失的动力比获得收益的动力强烈得多［专业术语称此为“损失厌恶”（ loss aversion）］\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2638\n非认知技能不是通过学习形成的，其形成途径包括受信赖的导师的教导，以及运动等可以让孩子学习合作和领导力的团体活动。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2648\n青少年选择听取导师的意见不仅可以获得信息，还可以从导师那里得到叙事，以指导自己的人生。父母奖惩范围之外的健康叙事能产生高尚的熏陶效果，让误入歧途的青少年返回正轨，因为父母的权力会妨碍孩子听从的意愿。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2651\n学校其实并不是为人生做准备的，而是为将来要接受的培训做准备。学校充其量能培养一些人的认知能力，这些能力可以帮助他们获得技能并在一些职业中产生高生产率。但非认知技能在学校中不会得到同等程度的关注。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2668\n专业人士知道需要什么：高质量的技术性职业教育与培训。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2684\n道德企业的概念：企业的整个团队把一项比个人致富更大的使命内化为自己的追求。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2719\n国富论》所代表的粗糙心理学认为人们只关心钱。《道德情操论》所代表的更准确的心理学则告诉我们，人们也关心自己的社会地位：他们尊重别人，并被别人尊重。关于人为什么事而后悔的证据证实了我们的直觉：人更在意尊重而不是金钱。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2754\n在重新思考就业权时意识形态没什么用：左派意识形态分子憎恶劳动力“市场”，右派意识形态分子将其神圣化。自由市场派最常见的批评是最低工资会导致失业。失业是出差错最明显的表征，但并不总是最重要的表征。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2756\n劳动力市场有两个不同功能：其一是将拥有特定技能的求职者与企业为这些技能而设的职位配对，这个匹配的过程会影响失业率；另一个功能会影响社会的普遍繁荣，即对培养这些职业技能的投资。这两个功能之间存在着固有的张力。如果能做出具有约束力的承诺，投资就会更可行。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2799\n一个必然的推论是，未来需要大规模扩张的一个高度劳动密集型行业将是培训业。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2917\n哈佛大学著名经济学家拉里·萨默斯（ Larry Summers）曾提出，一个社会中工程师与律师的人数比与国家的经济增长率存在相关性。这一针见血地指出了一个更大的问题：市场力量无法使掠夺性活动与具有社会价值的活动（例如创新）实现正确的平衡。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2938\n抑制社会分化\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2956\n为了将不断提高的国家生产力转化为国民更美好的生活，逐步减少工作时间并相应延长假期是合理且必要的途径。不采取这些做法及上文提出的政策，社会将进一步分裂为两个对立的阶层：一是工作狂的高技能阶层，有大把金钱但时间很少；二是低技能阶层，有大把时间但金钱很少。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2966\n目前的挑战是缩小不断扩大的生产率分化。解决这个问题需要我们进行一场长征，首先就要从父爱主义社会管理（国家强制管理拒不服从的家庭）转向母爱主义社会管理（国家以实际支持来为这些家庭提供缓冲）。\n\n第九章 全球分化：赢家和落后群体 > 位置 3003\n比较优势的主张告诉我们，在各国内部，由于贸易带来了共同的收益，只要在每个国家里通过再分配进行合适的补偿，就有可能使每个人的境况都得到改善。\n\n第九章 全球分化：赢家和落后群体 > 位置 3007\n损失主要通过劳动力市场传递，且在地理上是集中的。\n\n第九章 全球分化：赢家和落后群体 > 位置 3097\n全球化不是一个要么全盘接受要么全盘拒绝的整体现象。全球化是各种经济与社会变化的大杂烩，这些变化都是可以单独拿出来分析的。公共政策的任务是：鼓励全球化中肯定有益的成分；有的成分大体是有益的，但会对某些群体造成重大损失，对这些成分要安排补偿机制；有的成分会导致财富再分配，而我们无法快速地通过补偿机制来纠正这种再分配，对这些成分则应限制。\n\n第四部分 重建包容性政治 - 第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3131\n当前政治战场的主要形势似乎是，震惊和愤怒的功利主义与罗尔斯主义先锋队，正在遭受民粹主义意识形态分子的进攻。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3196\n但政治是社会的反映，社会不好，政治也不会好。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3196\n只有当一个社会有足够多的公民要求符合道德和务实的政治时，这样的政治才会产生。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3197\n正是由于这个原因，本书主要是为公民而非政客写的。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3234\n人并不是自私到变态的“经济人”，需要在社会家长制中由柏拉图笔下的“卫国者”来约束，相反，正常人知道人际关系会产生义务，而履行义务是我们人生使命感的核心。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3235\n柏拉图笔下的“卫国者”和“经济人”的有害结合已经主导了公共政策。这种思维无情地剥离了人的道德责任，让父爱主义国家来承担义务。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3255\n将林林总总的义务广泛分布于社会之中不仅能让这些义务得到更好地履行，也能让人们在积极履行义务的过程中获得更大的充实感。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3259\n政治主要是国家层面的。要让政治发挥其潜力来打造一个互惠义务组成的密网，一个国家的民众需要接受某种身份认同。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3270\n但最能起到增强效果的方式是传播关于归属感的支持性政治叙事，这是我们的政治领导人的核心职责。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3273\n人们更关注处在自己社交网络中心的人，而不是在电视上侃侃而谈的人。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3294\n共同身份会成为远见式互惠的基础。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3316\n真正重要的政治威胁是排他的民族主义。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3316\n自由派放弃共同归属感及本可由这种归属感支持的良性爱国主义，也就是放弃了唯一能把我们的社会团结起来共同寻求解决方案的力量。自由派大意而不负责任地将这种力量交给了江湖骗子式的极端派，他们正得意洋洋地为实现自己的偏激目的而扭曲这种力量。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3319\n我们曾经做到过，我们也可以再次做到。\n","source":"_posts/《资本主义的未来》摘抄.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 《资本主义的未来》摘抄\ntags: 随笔\ncomments: false\ncategories: 随笔\ndate: 2020-11-25 18:10:52\n---\n第一部分 危机 - 第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 60\n新的成功者既不是资本家也不是普通劳动者，而是受过良好教育、拥有新技能的人。他们组成了一个新阶层，他们在大学里相遇，形成新的共同身份，基于技能对彼此心怀尊重。他们甚至形成了一种独特的道德，将少数族裔、性取向等特征上升为群体身份，将其视为受害者。他们宣称只有自己关心受害者群体，从而对受教育程度低于自己的人主张道德优势。受过良好教育的人组成了一个新的统治阶层，比以往任何时候都更信任政府并彼此信任。\n<!--more-->\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 74\n调查显示，年轻人空前悲观：大多数年轻人觉得自己未来的生活水准将低于父母的。这并不是错觉：过去 40年来，资本主义的经济表现不断恶化。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 94\n大自然厌恶真空，选民也一样。现实与可能性之间的鸿沟导致的挫折感为两种伺机而动的政客提供了动力——民粹主义者和意识形态分子。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 100\n意识形态提供了一种诱人的组合，简单的道德确定性和无所不能的分析，能够为任何问题提供自信的答案。几种复兴的意识形态，诸如 20世纪的法西斯主义和 17世纪的宗教原教旨主义，都曾引诱着社会走向悲剧。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 107\n克里斯马式的民粹主义者。民粹主义者连意识形态的粗略分析也不做，直接跳向只有两分钟说服力的解决方案。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 168\n事实很快就证明，以机械的方式从个体的“效用”出发，推论出关于社会福祉的理论，是无论如何也达不到理论连贯性的基本标准的。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 195\n成功者意识不到普通人的焦虑。功利主义先锋相信自己才德兼备，凭着这样的自信，他们毫不迟疑地自视为当代的柏拉图“卫国者”，有权否定其他人的价值观。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 204\n自由至上主义者（ Libertarians）把权利归还给了个人，但没有把义务归还给个人。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 211\n最初争取包容的运动（也许不经意地）变得僵化，演化出相互对立的群体身份，人们通过设想某个敌对群体来激发斗志。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 221\n功利主义者、罗尔斯主义者和自由至上主义者都强调个人而非集体；\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 222\n功利主义经济学家要求按需求进行再分配；逐渐地，福利制度被重新设计，以使权利与贡献不再相关，在此过程中，公平这一常规的人类价值被摒弃。没有做出过贡献的人比做出过贡献的人更受优待。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 228\n这两种意识形态都摒弃互惠与应得性的常规道德本能，抬高一个单一的理性原则（尽管二者的理性内涵内容不同），并主张由专家组成的先锋队来将这项原则强加于社会。而合作运动是建立在那些常规道德本能之上的，\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 232\n当左派知识分子放弃实践性社群主义的社会民主主义，转奉功利主义与罗尔斯主义的意识形态时，中右翼政党要么僵化地怀旧，在思想方面无所建树，要么被另一群同样误入歧途的知识分子所俘获。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 237\n新经济学说结盟。该派学说认为，追求自身利益的自由在仅受竞争制约的情况下能产生比公共监管和规划更好的结果。该学说为罗纳德·里根（ Ronald Reagan）和玛格丽特·撒切尔（ Margaret Thatcher）的政策革命奠定了思想基础。尽管左右派的新意识形态呈现出截然对立的面貌，但它们都强调个人，并推崇精英统治：左派推崇的道德优越的精英与右派推崇的经济能力优越的精英竞争。左派眼中的超级明星是很有德行的人，右派眼中的超级明星则是极为富有的人。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 250\n公共选择理论认识到，公共政策决定通常不是由超然的圣人做出的，而是通过平衡包括官僚集团自身在内的不同利益集团的诉求而形成的。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 287\n克罗斯兰是一位实用主义者：评价某种政策要看其是否行之有效，而非是否符合某种意识形态的信条。实用主义哲学的一项核心主张是，因为社会在不断变化，所以我们不应期待有永恒的真理。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 306\n对大多数人来说，人际关系对生活有根本性的意义，而人际关系必然涉及义务。至关重要的是，人们会做出互惠性承诺，这是社群的根本要素。自私与互惠性义务之间的斗争，即个人主义与社群之间的斗争，在三种主导人类生活的组织中展开：国家、企业和家庭。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 337\n因为没有更好的术语，我姑且把我提出的这些弥合分歧的政策统称为“社会母爱主义”（ social maternalism）。我主张政府在经济和社会领域发挥积极作用，但政府不能公然给自己授权。政府的税收政策应遏制强者攫取其不应得的收益，但不能热衷于把富人的收入分给穷人。政府监管应赋予“创造性破坏”（竞争驱动经济进步的过程）中的受损者索取补偿的权利，而不能试图阻挠这个赋予资本主义惊人活力的进程本身。政府倡导的爱国主义应当具有凝聚力，取代对支离破碎的受害者身份认同的强调。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 342\n我不是指把一堆杂乱的观点拼凑在一起，而是指要接受人们多样化和本能的价值观，并接受基于这种多样性而做出的务实取舍。诉诸某种单一的绝对原则，使其凌驾于各种价值观之上，这种做法注定会导致分裂。\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 > 位置 351\n在《国家挑战》（ The Fix）一书中，乔纳森·泰珀曼（ Jonathan Tepperman）研究了十位这样的领导人，\n\n第一章 新的焦虑 >

432\n斯密在他的书中重点关注的情感：温和的压力，如羞耻和尊重，促使我们交换义务——如果你愿意帮助我，我就愿意帮助你。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 442\n人既受《国富论》中描述的“愿望”驱动，也受《道德情操论》中描述的“义务”驱动。无论愿望还是义务，斯密都认为，从自给自足到互相交易的转变是革命性的，但他自己似乎认为《道德情操论》更重要，义务的交易比愿望的交易更重要。“\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 454\n道德源于价值观而非理性。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 457\n叫做“动机性推理”的假象。理性基于价值观，而不是价值观基于理性，或者正如斯密那句形象的话：“理性是激情的奴隶。”\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 459\n《理性之谜》（ The Enigma of Reason）\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 461\n理性本身是为说服他人而进化出来的，而不是为了改进我们自己的决策。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 463\n过去 200年间人类大脑的大规模扩容是由社交需求驱动的。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 473\n实用主义拒绝意识形态，没有一种价值观是至高无上、绝对和永恒的。\n\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 484\n实用主义者承认这些局限性：个体的道德判断是可能出错的。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 487\n有些政治哲学家对个体的实践理性能力极度怀疑，他们看重蓄积在制度里的智慧，这是保守主义。有些政治哲学家信任个体的理性，且看重其带来的自由，这是自由主义。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 497\n千万年来，人类唯有通过群体合作才能生存，单干就意味着死亡。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 507\n我们不是从自身推导出世界，而是从所处的世界推导出自身。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 545\n归属感、义务和因果关系，这三种叙事结合在一起，形成一张互惠义务之网。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 556\n但信念体系也有一种不可估量的好处：它将自私的“经济人”变成以义务为驱动力的人，他们自视为某个团体的一分子，\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 573\n人群就是环境，人们演化是为了相互适应。一个社会的起点决定了它的终点，在演化过程中，初始差异被放大。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 608\n已经把全世界联系在一起的“硅谷”巨头们想象，他们正在通过这种方式开启一个团结在其自由至上主义价值观周围的全球社会。这是很难实现的。连接人与人的新技术正在取代偶然地由地域决定的人类网络化群体（地方社会或国家）。新的电子网络群体的成员，其身份是基于自我的选择而非偶然形成的：在“回音室”里，人们更喜欢与观点一致者建立联系。[ 25]在该过程中，叙事创造信念，信念与人们共同生活的空间日益脱节。但我们的政治单位依然是由我们的居住地决定的。我们的选票是按地域划区计票的，源于政治的公共服务和政策是按地域提供和适用的。所以，之前导致不同政体之间的规范存在巨大差异的过程，在新技术带来的地域连通性下，正在导致各政体内部出现巨大的规范差异。政体内的观念变得更加两极分化；分歧更容易转化为人身攻击；几百年来导致政体之间对立的仇恨，正在每个政体内部导致信念体系的对立。历史上政体之间的仇恨演变为大规模的有组织暴力。政体内部的仇恨将产生不同结果，但同样可能是令人悲伤的。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 648\n亚当·斯密所接受的经济学的坚实基础是承认非互惠性的利他主义只限于援救义务：这不足以对抗利己主义。\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置 649\n归属感、义务与目的性行动的叙事结合\n\n第二章 道德的基础：从自私的基因到道德的团体 > 位置

728\n当我们承认对他人负有的新义务时，我们的社会更有希望实现繁荣；当我们忽视这些义务时，社会便会远离繁荣。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 776\n将良好理念与道德目标联系在一起的国家总会创造奇迹。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 791\n新的焦虑植根于经济差异。繁荣的大都市和衰败的中小城市之间的地域差距正在扩大；一道不断拉大的鸿沟两个群体分隔开来，一边是拥有受人尊重和富有成就感的工作的人，另一边是职业前景黯淡甚至失业的人。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 797\n但如果国家试图将一套迥异的价值观强加给它的公民，就会失去国民信任，权威也会受损。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 798\n随着社会分裂的加剧，人们愈发不愿宽宏地对待裂痕另一边的人了。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 810\n社会民主主义\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 832\n“理性经济人”\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 834\n“理性社会人”\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 842\n综上所述，每个人有四个获得尊重的来源。一是我们的工作，二是我们的国籍，三是我们选择突出哪个身份，四是与像我们一样选择突出该身份的人组成的群体。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 863\n整个过程中，所有人只是在努力把自己获得的尊重最大化。但由于经济的结构性变化，一道裂痕出现了。高技能水平者把突出的身份改成了自己的工作。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 879\n帮助他人的意愿是通过结合三种叙事而产生的：对一个群体的共同归属感；群体内部的互惠义务；行为与群体幸福之间的联系，这种联系表明行为是有目的的。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 902\n如果我们相信自己能预测他人的行为，我们就会信任他人。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 911\n在一个复杂的社会中，密布的关系网络依赖于信任。因此，当信任崩溃时，合作也开始瓦解。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 918\n人们警惕共同的国家认同，这是可以理解的，毕竟民族主义曾造成可怕的后果。所有身份认同都隐含排他性，但如果它做出明确、敌对的排他性规定则是有害的。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 934\n现代繁荣社会中的人是在权力已经转化为权威的环境里长大的，所以把这视为理所当然。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 947\n所有这些看似各不相同的分离运动都有一个共同点：它们都涉及一国内的富裕地区试图摆脱对其余地区所负的义务。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 964\n随着遵守义务行为的减少，权利变得无法实现，人们对政府的信任度下滑。这是席卷西方各国的强烈趋势。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 989\n残酷的现实是，公共政策的场域必然是“空间性”的。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1000\n从公共政策角度看，处在同一空间里的人是一体的，但从社会角度看却已经不再是这样了。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1000\n空间性社群在遭受两方面的冲击：作为替代性社群的网络回音室，以及更彻底地避开面对面交流、\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1001\n沉入焦虑性自恋的孤立状态。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1013\n民族主义者\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1027\n归属、乡土与爱国主义\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1028\n为了使每个人都能幸福，一个社会需要一种强烈的共同身份认同。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1073\n基于地方的身份认同是在进化中形成的人类心灵深处最根深蒂固的特征之一，不属于那些相对较晚时因使用语言而形成的软性价值观。基于地方的身份认同不仅根深蒂固，而且很强烈。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1080\n叙事促进记忆，这让我们把家乡不仅仅视为其当前的样貌，还视为一个演变的过程：我们对家乡城市所经历的重重变化的理解，增强了我们对当前眼中的这座城市的归属感。\n\n 第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1109\n显然，在战争时期，绝大多数关于目的性行为的叙事意味着共同利益，因此能强化共同身份；\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1111\n而对立身份对社会是有害的。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1112\n宣扬利益对立的每个叙事孤立地看都有可能是对的，但这些叙事累积起来就具有很大的破坏性，导致集体福祉恶化。\n\n第三章 道德的国家 > 位置 1114\n政客一直回避关于共同归属的叙事，无论是关于地域还是目的的，这无意中进一步削弱了父爱主义国家履行职责的能力。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1138\n如果说现代资本主义有一个让人最反感的特征，那就是沉迷于盈利。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1147\n企业经营的目的是履行对客户和员工的义务。盈利不是目标，而是为在可持续基础上实现这些目标而必须满足的条件。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1166\n一家公司需要使命感。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1310\n公共政策出错的原因是陈旧意识形态之间的尖锐斗争导致人们聚焦于不重要的问题。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1311\n右翼意识形态主张信仰“市场”，贬斥所有政策干预，其解决方案是：“政府不要再骑在企业背上，取消监管！”左翼意识形态贬斥资本主义，谴责企业和基金管理者贪得无厌，其解决方案是国家控制企业，将战略经济领域国有化。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1368\n集权使政府不用向国民负责，导致既得利益者猖獗不已，大多数人都明白这一点。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1374\n既得利益者对自身优势的了解远远超过政府官员。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1390\n生产率提升必然意味着经济的复杂性稳步增大，这导致其他产业也出现了一些网络化特征。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1426\n导致国际合作更困难的因素是绝大多数电子科技公司都是美国公司，因此美国政府对国际合作充其量持模棱两可的态度。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1444\n在企业规模越大、生产率与利润越高的行业，规模经济效应带来的额外收益是一种“经济租金”。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1446\n经济学家所说的“经济租金”是指从一项经济活动的收益中除去为吸引劳动者、资金与企业家所需的成本之后的那部分收益。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1490\n幸福并非来自金钱方面的成功。\n\n第四章 道德的企业 > 位置 1527\n道德企业已经被吸血乌贼取代。时代已经改变，需要让它回到从前的样子。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1563\n开明自利支持一种共同身份，共同身份界定了一种具有区别性的互惠性所适用的范围。归属于家庭的共同身份很容易建立，因为它是一种日常生活的现实：“相互尊重”的范围。互惠性承诺的规范是情感的自然延伸，而且使命感能增强这些规范：如果有足够多的人遵从，所有人就能得到长期性的物质利益，这就是“开明的自利”。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1581\n以前被视为需要抵制的诱惑行为，现在被视为需要把握住的自我实现时刻。许多新阶层家庭的夫妻都发现，要想实现自我就必须离婚。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1606\n在日本，养育“用来炫耀的孩子”的压力比西方社会大得多，所以单亲家庭无法和双亲家庭竞争。因此，受教育程度高的日本单身女性更倾向于养宠物，而不是无法让自己感到骄傲的孩子。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1716\n道德家庭的某些方面是权力与欺凌关系的拙劣伪装，扔掉这些东西再好不过。但从中“解放”出来的很多不过是伪装成自我发现的自私。与此类似，一边以功利主义态度关心“全世界的穷人”，一边否认对家庭的责任，这并不是什么道德觉醒，而是为了摆出道德姿态而获得的廉价快感罢了。\n\n第五章 道德的家庭 > 位置 1732\n是，经济学领域的一项重大突破表明，“变弱”可能意味着“变强”。一个人也许有必要放弃一些权力，以便做出可信的承诺，并从中获益。能够做出承诺是开明自利的特征。说得花哨点就是一种“责任手段”解决了“时间不一致性问题”。该技术的发现者们获得了诺贝尔奖。\n\n第六章 道德的世界 > 位置 1860\n在其他方面，欧盟仍是一个极有价值的俱乐部，并有潜力发挥更多作用。但是，欧盟已不再是一个大家毫不含糊地相互支持的俱乐部了，而是在日益变成强国指挥其他国家的组织。\n\n第六章 道德的世界 > 位置 1930\n把头脑与爱心结合起来可以指导我们具体应该成立什么样的新的互惠性俱乐部，从而应对迫在眉睫的全球性焦虑，并为需要援救的人提供有效的救助。二战后那一代全球领袖面临的形势远比今天危险，但他们同时实现了这两个目标，送给后人一个虽远算不上完美但却得到显著改善的世界。他们的后继者坐拥这份遗产，却沉溺于意识形态和民粹主义。结果是国际俱乐部弱化，援救义务变味，我们正在为此付出代价。但只要回到实用主义的思路，我们不仅能重建道德世界，而且能使它变得比以往任何时候都更好。\n\n第三部分 重建包容性社会 - 第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 1959\n造成这种新分化的力量是基于两种可追溯到工业革命的简单关系。一是生产率和专业化之间的关系，通常的说法是“在实践中学习”（ learning by doing）。专注于更少任务的人能培养出更高超的技能。二是生产率和规模之间的关系，通常的说法是“规模经济”。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 1972\n1980年代以来，知识经济呈指数增长，其推动力有两个：大学中基础研究的空前增多，以及与此互补的公司中应用研究的增多。利用物质造福人类的潜力仅受到物理基本定律的限制。我们目前还在这个过程的初级阶段，因为复杂的物质世界极难掌握。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 1975\n通过一个个科学发现，我们探索着这个复杂世界，这可能逐渐使生产率发生革命性突破。但人类要凭有限的能力掌握复杂物质世界，唯一途径是让能力最强的人变得越来越专业化。 15世纪之后，再没有人能严肃地表示自己知道所有已知知识了。今天，最聪明的人会抵达某个狭窄领域的知识前沿，形成极为深入的理解，而相应地会远离其他领域的前沿。不仅研究是这样，具有商业价值的技能也是如此。例如，法律越来越复杂，所以不同法律分支变得更精细了。大学的扩张不仅催生研究，而且培养了有能力掌握这类技能的毕业生。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2043\n双方观点中包含的道理仅能说服其追随者，但都不完全正确。右派认识到的道理是，政策目标绝不能是把地方城市变成“福利街”。幸福依赖于尊严和使命感，而不仅仅取决于人的消费能力。用公共福利来补贴没有成就感的工作，这样的策略绝不等同于创造需要特定技能、劳动者掌握该技能后会感到自豪的就业机会。所以，政策目标应该是创造高生产率的就业机会，而不是用公共财政来补贴从事低生产率工作的人。左派认定的道理是，凭借在大都市里的高薪专业工作富得流油又洋洋得意的人，在道德上是令人反感的。这些人认为他们的收入都是应得的，而我将证明不是这回事。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2061\n正如乔纳森·海特发现的，对大多数人来说，公平意味着比例性和应得性，而不是平等。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2070\n亨利·乔治的大胆思想\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2072\n正确的政策是对城市土地的增值部分征税。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2082\n所有集聚经济效益都成了租金，为土地所有者获得。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2105\n亨利·乔治的思想是实践理性的早期应用，讨论的是租金与其他形式的收入在应得性方面的差异。他谨慎地把土地增值产生的租金和资本收益区分开来，认为后者具有道德合法性。他的主张既不属于马克思主义，也不属于民粹主义。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2126\n假想情况一：一个包含有不同技能和不同居住需求的居民的大都市\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2146\n假想情况二：需要法治的大都市\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2168\n大都市的生产率依赖的是整个国家提供的公共品，如法治和已经做出的旨在增强连通性的基础设施投资。这些公共品为所有人都提供了一些好处，但高技能的大都市工作者从中获得了过高的收益。更根本的是，集聚经济效益本质上是由国民集体创造的。是无数工作者的互动，而不仅仅是每一名高薪工作者的独自努力，创造了集聚经济效益。高技能人士有权保留其高生产率产生的一部分收益，但不应该得到全部收益。此外，不在大都市里工作的人，由于其生产率并非在其他人的帮助下提高，他们所应得的份额也不应与大都市里的高技能人士一样多。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2198\n但事实是亨利·乔治定理已经失效。在大都市里，获得大部分集聚经济效益的人是居住需求很小的高技能人士，这意味着大量的寻租机会。\n\n第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 > 位置 2371\n繁荣城市和破败城市之间的地域分化不是不可避免的；这一现象是晚近发生的，而且是可以逆转的。但靠公共政策的微小调整无法逆转这一趋势。简单地说，小幅调整无济于事，但更根本的问题是，经济发展的空间动力取决于预期：企业选择的经营地是它们预计其他企业将选择的经营地。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2443\n证据表明，人的决策很大程度上受社会网络中其他人观点的影响，这说明家庭和朋友的反应很重要，因为我们都是社会动物。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2559\n现在所有人都能上网，但近期的研究显示，受教育程度高的家庭的孩子学会利用互联网来扩展知识，而低受教育程度家庭的孩子则用互联网来消遣。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2561\n学校可以发生的最有价值的改变是让学校更具有社会融合性。社会融合性的主要障碍是学区。因为人们会根据自己的社会地位高低来选择居住地点，所以学区会导致这种社会分层反映到学校里。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2573\n但最主要的认识是教师的素质远比资金重要。提升教师群体的素质有四个简单的途径：吸引更好的教师加入教学队伍，基于有评估的试验这种实用主义做法来培训教师，让最好的教师投入挑战性最大的地方，淘汰最差的教师。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2597\n人类避免损失的动力比获得收益的动力强烈得多［专业术语称此为“损失厌恶”（ loss aversion）］\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2638\n非认知技能不是通过学习形成的，其形成途径包括受信赖的导师的教导，以及运动等可以让孩子学习合作和领导力的团体活动。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2648\n青少年选择听取导师的意见不仅可以获得信息，还可以从导师那里得到叙事，以指导自己的人生。父母奖惩范围之外的健康叙事能产生高尚的熏陶效果，让误入歧途的青少年返回正轨，因为父母的权力会妨碍孩子听从的意愿。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2651\n学校其实并不是为人生做准备的，而是为将来要接受的培训做准备。学校充其量能培养一些人的认知能力，这些能力可以帮助他们获得技能并在一些职业中产生高生产率。但非认知技能在学校中不会得到同等程度的关注。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2668\n专业人士知道需要什么：高质量的技术性职业教育与培训。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2684\n道德企业的概念：企业的整个团队把一项比个人致富更大的使命内化为自己的追求。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2719\n国富论》所代表的粗糙心理学认为人们只关心钱。《道德情操论》所代表的更准确的心理学则告诉我们，人们也关心自己的社会地位：他们尊重别人，并被别人尊重。关于人为什么事而后悔的证据证实了我们的直觉：人更在意尊重而不是金钱。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2754\n在重新思考就业权时意识形态没什么用：左派意识形态分子憎恶劳动力“市场”，右派意识形态分子将其神圣化。自由市场派最常见的批评是最低工资会导致失业。失业是出差错最明显的表征，但并不总是最重要的表征。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2756\n劳动力市场有两个不同功能：其一是将拥有特定技能的求职者与企业为这些技能而设的职位配对，这个匹配的过程会影响失业率；另一个功能会影响社会的普遍繁荣，即对培养这些职业技能的投资。这两个功能之间存在着固有的张力。如果能做出具有约束力的承诺，投资就会更可行。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2799\n一个必然的推论是，未来需要大规模扩张的一个高度劳动密集型行业将是培训业。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2917\n哈佛大学著名经济学家拉里·萨默斯（ Larry Summers）曾提出，一个社会中工程师与律师的人数比与国家的经济增长率存在相关性。这一针见血地指出了一个更大的问题：市场力量无法使掠夺性活动与具有社会价值的活动（例如创新）实现正确的平衡。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2938\n抑制社会分化\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2956\n为了将不断提高的国家生产力转化为国民更美好的生活，逐步减少工作时间并相应延长假期是合理且必要的途径。不采取这些做法及上文提出的政策，社会将进一步分裂为两个对立的阶层：一是工作狂的高技能阶层，有大把金钱但时间很少；二是低技能阶层，有大把时间但金钱很少。\n\n第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 > 位置 2966\n目前的挑战是缩小不断扩大的生产率分化。解决这个问题需要我们进行一场长征，首先就要从父爱主义社会管理（国家强制管理拒不服从的家庭）转向母爱主义社会管理（国家以实际支持来为这些家庭提供缓冲）。\n\n第九章 全球分化：赢家和落后群体 > 位置 3003\n比较优势的主张告诉我们，在各国内部，由于贸易带来了共同的收益，只要在每个国家里通过再分配进行合适的补偿，就有可能使每个人的境况都得到改善。\n\n第九章 全球分化：赢家和落后群体 > 位置 3007\n损失主要通过劳动力市场传递，且在地理上是集中的。\n\n第九章 全球分化：赢家和落后群体 > 位置 3097\n全球化不是一个要么全盘接受要么全盘拒绝的整体现象。全球化是各种经济与社会变化的大杂烩，这些变化都是可以单独拿出来分析的。公共政策的任务是：鼓励全球化中肯定有益的成分；有的成分大体是有益的，但会对某些群体造成重大损失，对这些成分要安排补偿机制；有的成分会导致财富再分配，而我们无法快速地通过补偿机制来纠正这种再分配，对这些成分则应限制。\n\n第四部分 重建包容性政治 - 第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3131\n当前政治战场的主要形势似乎是，震惊和愤怒的功利主义与罗尔斯主义先锋队，正在遭受民粹主义意识形态分子的进攻。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3196\n但政治是社会的反映，社会不好，政治也不会好。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3196\n只有当一个社会有足够多的公民要求符合道德和务实的政治时，这样的政治才会产生。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3197\n正是由于这个原因，本书主要是为公民而非政客写的。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3234\n人并不是自私到变态的“经济人”，需要在社会家长制中由柏拉图笔下的“卫国者”来约束，相反，正常人知道人际关系会产生义务，而履行义务是我们人生使命感的核心。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3235\n柏拉图笔下的“卫国者”和“经济人”的有害结合已经主导了公共政策。这种思维无情地剥离了人的道德责任，让父爱主义国家来承担义务。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3255\n将林林总总的义务广泛分布于社会之中不仅能让这些义务得到更好地履行，也能让人们在积极履行义务的过程中获得更大的充实感。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3259\n政治主要是国家层面的。要让政治发挥其潜力来打造一个互惠义务组成的密网，一个国家的民众需要接受某种身份认同。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3270\n但最能起到增强效果的方式是传播关于归属感的支持性政治叙事，这是我们的政治领导人的核心职责。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3273\n人们更关注处在自己社交网络中心的人，而不是在电视上侃侃而谈的人。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3294\n共同身份会成为远见式互惠的基础。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3316\n真正重要的政治威胁是排他的民族主义。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3316\n自由派放弃共同归属感及本可由这种归属感支持的良性爱国主义，也就是放弃了唯一能把我们的社会团结起来共同寻求解决方案的力量。自由派大意而不负责任地将这种力量交给了江湖骗子式的极端派，他们正得意洋洋地为实现自己的偏激目的而扭曲这种力量。\n\n第十章 战胜极端派 > 位置 3319\n我们曾经做到过，我们也可以再次做到。\n","slug":"《资本主义的未来》摘抄","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.503Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vksi003rpmnk0o6a9el6","content":"<p>第一部分 危机 - 第一章 新的焦虑 &gt;

337\n因为没有更好的术语，我姑且把我提出的这些弥合分歧的政策统称为“社会母爱主义”（\nsocial\nmaternalism）。我主张政府在经济和社会领域发挥积极作用，但政府不能公然给自己授权。政府的税收政策应遏制强者攫取其不应得的收益，但不能热衷于把富人的收入分给穷人。政府监管应赋予“创造性破坏”（竞争驱动经济进步的过程）中的受损者索取补偿的权利，而不能试图阻挠这个赋予资本主义惊人活力的进程本身。政府倡导的爱国主义应当具有凝聚力，取代对支离破碎的受害者身份认同的强调。</p>\n<p>第一章

地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 &gt; 位置 1972\n1980年代以来，知识经济呈指数增长，其推动力有两个：大学中基础研究的空前增多，以及与此互补的公司中应用研究的增多。利用物质造福人类的潜力仅受到物理基本定律的限制。我们目前还在这个过程的初级阶段，因为复杂的物质世界极难掌握。</p>\n<p>第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 &gt; 位置 1975\n通过一个个科学发现，我们探索着这个复杂世界，这可能逐渐使生产率发生革命性突破。但人类要凭有限的能力掌握复杂物质世界，唯一途径是让能力最强的人变得越来越专业化。\n15世纪之后，再没有人能严肃地表示自己知道所有已知知识了。今天，最聪明的人会抵达某个狭窄领域的知识前沿，形成极为深入的理解，而相应地会远离其他领域的前沿。不仅研究是这样，具有商业价值的技能也是如此。例如，法律越来越复杂，所以不同法律分支变得更精细了。大学的扩张不仅催生研究，而且培养了有能力掌握这类技能的毕业生。</p>\n<p>第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 &gt; 位置 2043\n双方观点中包含的道理仅能说服其追随者，但都不完全正确。右派认识到的道理是，政策目标绝不能是把地方城市变成“福利街”。幸福依赖于尊严和使命感，而不仅仅取决于人的消费能力。用公共福利来补贴没有成就感的工作，这样的策略绝不等同于创造需要特定技能、劳动者掌握该技能后会感到自豪的就业机会。所以，政策目标应该是创造高生产率的就业机会，而不是用公共财政来补贴从事低生产率工作的人。左派认定的道理是，凭借在大都市里的高薪专业工作富得流油又洋洋得意的人，在道德上是令人反感的。这些人认为他们的收入都是应得的，而我将证明不是这回事。</p>\n<p>第七章

2168\n大都市的生产率依赖的是整个国家提供的公共品，如法治和已经做出的旨在增强连通性的基础设施投资。这些公共品为所有人都提供了一些好处，但高技能的大都市工作者从中获得了过高的收益。更根本的是，集聚经济效益本质上是由国民集体创造的。是无数工作者的互动，而不仅仅是每一名高薪工作者的独自努力，创造了集聚经济效益。高技能人士有权保留其高生产率产生的一部分收益，但不应该得到全部收益。此外，不在大都市里工作的人，由于其生产率并非在其他人的帮助下提高，他们所应得的份额也不应与大都市里的高技能人士一样多。</p>\n<p>第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 &gt; 位置 2198\n但事实是亨利·乔治定理已经失效。在大都市里，获得大部分集聚经济效益的人是居住需求很小的高技能人士，这意味着大量的寻租机会。</p>\n<p>第七章 地域分化：繁荣的大都市，破败的普通城市 &gt; 位置 2371\n繁荣城市和破败城市之间的地域分化不是不可避免的；这一现象是晚近发生的，而且是可以逆转的。但靠公共政策的微小调整无法逆转这一趋势。简单地说，小幅调整无济于事，但更根本的问题是，经济发展的空间动力取决于预期：企业选择的经营地是它们预计其他企业将选择的经营地。</p>\n<p>第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 &gt; 位置

2754\n在重新思考就业权时意识形态没什么用：左派意识形态分子憎恶劳动力“市场”，右派意识形态分子将其神圣化。自由市场派最常见的批评是最低工资会导致失业。失业是出差错最明显的表征，但并不总是最重要的表征。</p>\n<p>第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 &gt; 位置 2756\n劳动力市场有两个不同功能：其一是将拥有特定技能的求职者与企业为这些技能而设的职位配对，这个匹配的过程会影响失业率；另一个功能会影响社会的普遍繁荣，即对培养这些职业技能的投资。这两个功能之间存在着固有的张力。如果能做出具有约束力的承诺，投资就会更可行。</p>\n<p>第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 &gt; 位置 2799\n一个必然的推论是，未来需要大规模扩张的一个高度劳动密集型行业将是培训业。</p>\n<p>第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 &gt; 位置 2917\n哈佛大学著名经济学家拉里·萨默斯（ Larry\nSummers）曾提出，一个社会中工程师与律师的人数比与国家的经济增长率存在相关性。这一针见血地指出了一个更大的问题：市场力量无法使掠夺性活动与具有社会价值的活动（例如创新）实现正确的平衡。</p>\n<p>第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 &gt; 位置 2938\n抑制社会分化</p>\n<p>第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 &gt; 位置 2956\n为了将不断提高的国家生产力转化为国民更美好的生活，逐步减少工作时间并相应延长假期是合理且必要的途径。不采取这些做法及上文提出的政策，社会将进一步分裂为两个对立的阶层：一是工作狂的高技能阶层，有大把金钱但时间很少；二是低技能阶层，有大把时间但金钱很少。</p>\n<p>第八章 阶层分化：享有一切的家庭，分崩离析的家庭 &gt; 位置 2966\n目前的挑战是缩小不断扩大的生产率分化。解决这个问题需要我们进行一场长征，首先就要从父爱主义社会管理（国家强制管理拒不服从的家庭）转向母爱主义社会管理（国家以实际支持来为这些家庭提供缓冲）。</p>\n<p>第九章 全球分化：赢家和落后群体 &gt; 位置 3003\n比较优势的主张告诉我们，在各国内部，由于贸易带来了共同的收益，只要在每个国家里通过再分配进行合适的补偿，就有可能使每个人的境况都得到改善。</p>\n<p>第九章 全球分化：赢家和落后群体 &gt; 位置 3007\n损失主要通过劳动力市场传递，且在地理上是集中的。</p>\n<p>第九章 全球分化：赢家和落后群体 &gt; 位置 3097\n全球化不是一个要么全盘接受要么全盘拒绝的整体现象。全球化是各种经济与社会变化的大杂烩，这些变化都是可以单独拿出来分析的。公共政策的任务是：鼓励全球化中肯定有益的成分；有的成分大体是有益的，但会对某些群体造成重大损失，对这些成分要安排补偿机制；有的成分会导致财富再分配，而我们无法快速地通过补偿机制来纠正这种再分配，对这些成分则应限制。</p>\n<p>第四部分 重建包容性政治 - 第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3131\n当前政治战场的主要形势似乎是，震惊和愤怒的功利主义与罗尔斯主义先锋队，正在遭受民粹主义意识形态分子的进攻。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3196\n但政治是社会的反映，社会不好，政治也不会好。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3196\n只有当一个社会有足够多的公民要求符合道德和务实的政治时，这样的政治才会产生。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3197\n正是由于这个原因，本书主要是为公民而非政客写的。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3234\n人并不是自私到变态的“经济人”，需要在社会家长制中由柏拉图笔下的“卫国者”来约束，相反，正常人知道人际关系会产生义务，而履行义务是我们人生使命感的核心。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3235\n柏拉图笔下的“卫国者”和“经济人”的有害结合已经主导了公共政策。这种思维无情地剥离了人的道德责任，让父爱主义国家来承担义务。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3255\n将林林总总的义务广泛分布于社会之中不仅能让这些义务得到更好地履行，也能让人们在积极履行义务的过程中获得更大的充实感。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3259\n政治主要是国家层面的。要让政治发挥其潜力来打造一个互惠义务组成的密网，一个国家的民众需要接受某种身份认同。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3270\n但最能起到增强效果的方式是传播关于归属感的支持性政治叙事，这是我们的政治领导人的核心职责。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3273\n人们更关注处在自己社交网络中心的人，而不是在电视上侃侃而谈的人。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3294 共同身份会成为远见式互惠的基础。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3316\n真正重要的政治威胁是排他的民族主义。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置 3316\n自由派放弃共同归属感及本可由这种归属感支持的良性爱国主义，也就是放弃了唯一能把我们的社会团结起来共同寻求解决方案的力量。自由派大意而不负责任地将这种力量交给了江湖骗子式的极端派，他们正得意洋洋地为实现自己的偏激目的而扭曲这种力量。</p>\n<p>第十章 战胜极端派 &gt; 位置

动态规划 LeetCode 算法效率 算法\n<!--more-->\n\n# 一、引言\n\n生活中会遇到很多的问题，在使用代码来进行抽象逻辑的时候，有时候会需要抽象成数学上的算法，来提高处理的效率。因为计算机的资源是有限的，并不能简单地、暴力地帮我们处理所有的问题。而且，很多重复的工作，也有必要通过抽象成算法来简化。比如举一个常见的例子，从1~n累加的和，就可以通过高斯算法来表示，得到(1+n)*n/2这样的结果，这样可以大大简化运算的步骤，从而提高算法的效率。同样的例子还有很多。算法可以有效的帮助到我们。\n\n常用的有几大算法，分别是分治法、贪婪算法、动态规划、穷举法。当然还有一些分支定界法、回朔法、哈希表、深度优先搜索等等，在这里不做主要的介绍，在这里，主要介绍的是动态规划以及和动态规划思想有关算法的一些区别和需要注意的地方。\n\n# 二、何为动态规划\n\n动态规划（英文名称是：dynamic programming，这里的programing不是指程序代码，而是一种方法，一种算法思想）是解决某一类算法的思想，通过组合子问题的解，来求解最优解的方法。广泛应用在计算机科学、数学、生物信息学还有管理学科和经济学当中，通过把复杂的问题拆解成相对简单一些的子问题来求解。这样，通过分解成子问题，再通过子问题的最优集合，我们就可以方便的解决原来可能很复杂的问题。\n\n关于子问题，有两个概念是需要了解的，第一个是最优子结构，动态规划要解决的，就是从一堆问题的解决方案中，寻找问题的最优解，当然这种最优解可能不存在，也可能用动态规划是无法寻找和找不到的。当找到最优解之后，通过把最优解拼装起来，就可以得到最后的解了。\n\n如果问题比较复杂的话，那么非常有可能不止只有一个最优解，甚至，最优解也可以是一堆最优解的结合，这就是第二个关于子问题需要了解的，就是重复子问题。遇到这种情况，一般就需要通用递归重复子问题来得到最终的结果，当重复的子问题很多的时候，动态规划可以帮助我们减少很多重复的计算量。但是如果在使用递归方法来解决算法问题时，没有出现可以重复的子问题，那么就没必要非要使用动态规划的思想来解决，一般的递归方法也是可以很好地胜任的。\n\n还有一个关于子问题的概念是，无后效性，也就是说每个子问题可以是相互独立的，在推导的过程中，后面的结果不该再去对这个子问题的结果产生影响。这一点也很重要，因为动态规划一般都是自顶向下来进行的，如果是子问题之间相互关联性很大的话，那就说明，这并不需要来通过动态规划来处理，也会严重影响到最后的算法的效率问题，或者这个算法有可能无法在有限的时间内终止，这都是不符合我们预期的。\n\n我们可以这样说，寻找一个问题的子问题，并且完善子问题之间的关系的，写出状态转移方程，就是动态规划思想的基本思想过程了。也基本上可以说，如果能够证明，该问题存在最优的子问题，并且能够通过子问题的不断重复递归来得到最终的最优解，那么就说明该问题适合使用动态规划来解答。\n\n以下通过几个案例，来详细解答这个过程。\n\n# 三、案例一，不含连续1的非负整数\n\n先来一道，关于数位动态规划的案例：\n> 给定一个正整数n，找出小于或等于n的非负整数中，其二进制表示不包含连续的1的个数。[^1]\n\n## 方法1. 最简单粗暴的方法\n\n首先我们用最简单粗暴的方法来计算一下这个案例，代码如下：\n\n```Java\nclass Solution {\n    public int findIntegers(int n) {\n        int result = n + 1;\n        for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {\n            int nextNumber = i;\n            int remainder = nextNumber % 2;\n            while (nextNumber != 0) {\n                int lastRemainder = remainder;\n                nextNumber = nextNumber / 2;\n                remainder = nextNumber % 2;\n                if (lastRemainder == 1 && remainder == 1) {\n                    result--;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n以上方法，当输入是`2147483647`时，得到的结果是3524578，计算耗时为30063ms。 十进制转二进制的方法就是除二取余法，以上方法，从0~n，每个数都计算一遍，只要有出现连续的1，就在总数上减一，这样就可以得到最终的结果。\n\n## 方法2. 使用动态规划的思想来解析\n\n上面的方法最后的耗时显然是一个非常长的时间，那么我们该如何使用动态规划来分析这道题呢？按照暴力计算的思路，就是把全部的数都计算一遍，但显然没有这个必要去全部都去计算一遍。 举个例子，比如数字7，7转成二进制的数是`111`\n，转成二进制表示的话： 0 : 000，1 : 001，2 : 010，3 : 011，4 : 100，5 : 101，6 : 110，7 : 111\n\n以上符合条件的数，分别是`'0'`，`'1'`，`'10'`，`'100'`，`'101'`，一共5个数。我们可以把上面的数，使用二叉字典树的形式表达出来，如下图。\n\n{% mermaid graph TD %}\nroot(['110'])-->0((0))\nroot-->1((1))\n0-->00((0))\n0-->01((1))\n1-->10((0))\n1-->11((1))\n00-->000((0))\n00-->001((1))\n01-->010((0))\n01-->011((1))\n10-->100((0))\n10-->101((1))\n11-->110((0))\n11-->111((_))\n{% endmermaid %}\n\n可以发现，里面是会有很多重复计算的，当数字小的时候，这点儿耗时可以忽略，但是当数字很大的时候，这种计算就会是非常耗时的，有着更多无意义的重复计算。 先观察可以发现，当右子树，连续出现两个1的时候，代表着后面的数全部都是不符合要求的。\n\n也就是说，我们要计算的二进制表示中不含连续的1的数量，可以描述成要计算根节点为0的满二叉树中不含连续的1的路径数量。通过计算，我们可以列出来已知的一些结果。可以发现，要计算的根节点为0的满二叉树中不含连续1的路径数量，可以发现是上面2层不含连续1的路径数量之和。结果如下：\n\n|          |          |          |          |          |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| f(2^0)=1 | f(2^1)=1 | f(2^2)=2 | f(2^3)=3 | f(2^3)=5 |\n\n我们依据斐波那契数列的关系，可以得出状态转移方程：\n\n$$\nf(2^n)= \\begin{cases} f(2^{n-1})+f(2^{n-2})& \\text{n}\\geq{2}\\ 1& \\text{n}<{2}  \\end{cases} \n$$\n\n最后的代码如下：\n\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int findIntegers(int n) {\n        List<Integer> data = new ArrayList<>();\n        //添加斐波那契数列的初始值\n        data.add(1);\n        data.add(1);\n        //利用斐波那契数列，计算出最大数的有效结果\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            int val = 1 << i;\n            if (val >= 0 && val <= n) {\n                data.add(data.get(data.size() - 1) + data.get(data.size() - 2));\n            } else {\n                data.add(data.get(data.size() - 1) + data.get(data.size() - 2));\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        boolean haveOne = false;\n        int result = 0;\n        for (int i = data.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {\n            // << 位移，用来表示在二进制上，1向左移动了几位，比如 1 << 2 的结果是100，也就是十进制的4\n            int val = 1 << i;\n            // &位与，二进制数上只有当都是1时，才为1，用来筛选出最高位的1所在的位置\n            if ((n & val) != 0) {\n                //把已经出现的左边树的数都加上\n                result += data.get(i + 1);\n                //如果出现连续的1，这里跳出循环，代表的下面的数都不会再符合条件\n                if (haveOne) {\n                    break;\n                }\n                haveOne = true;\n            } else {\n                haveOne = false;\n            }\n            if (i == 0) {\n                //如果计算到了这里，需要再加1，因为0也是需要被计入符合条件的数字的\n                ++result;\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n输出的结果，在同一台电脑，同样的配置下，当输入是2147483647时，得到的结果是3524578，计算耗时为20ms。可以看到，相比较直接的暴力计算，最终的性能有了非常大的提升。\n\n# 四、案例二，不同的二叉搜索树\n\n这是一道关于计数问题的动态规划的案例：\n> 给你一个整数n，求恰由n个节点组成且节点值从1到n互不相同的二叉搜索树有多少种？返回满足题意的二叉搜索树的种数。[^2]\n\n## 1. 什么是二叉搜索树\n所谓的二叉搜索树，就是节点的左子树所有的值，一定小于该节点；右子树所有的值，一定大于该节点。比如，n=5时，可以得到：\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\ntree1_1((1))-->tree1_l[ ]\ntree1_1((1))-->tree1_2((3))\ntree1_2((3))-->tree1_3((2))\ntree1_2((3))-->tree1_r[ ]\n \ntree2_1((1))-->tree2_l[ ]\ntree2_1((1))-->tree2_2((2))\ntree2_2((2))-->tree2_r[

stroke:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:0px;\n```\n## 2.方法一： 使用动态规划的思想来解析\n要构建一颗二叉搜索树，我们可以把题目这样描述，给定一个有序的序列1\\~n，遍历这个序列，对于每个数字i来说，把$i$当做根节点，把1~(i-1)当做左子树，把(i+1)~n当做右子树，接着递归遍历这两个序列，重复前面的操作，最后计数，就可以得到我们要的结果。因为一开始遍历的时候，根的值不一样，我们可以认为，通过这种方式构建出来的二叉搜索树都是唯一的。\n\n接下来，我们定义两个函数，\n1. $G(n)$: 把题目要求的有序的序列1~n，构建起来的不同二叉树搜索树的计数个数，也就是我们最终想要得到的结果，这里和输入的序列的内容无关，只要是序列里面的数都不同就可以了，n表示数量。\n2. $F(i,n)$:以i为树的根，把1~(i-1)当做左子树，把(i+1)~n当做右子树构建起来的不同二叉树的计数个数，n表示数量，i表示根节点。\n\n根据上面的描述，我们可以得到如下的公式：\n$$\nG(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{F(i,n)} \\tag{1}\n$$\n\n首先，我们定义当n=1，或者n=2时，$G(n)=1,  G(n)=2$。\n\n接着，我们来计算$F(i,n)$，以i为树的根，计算的所有的二叉搜索树的集合，是左子树集合和右子树集合的笛卡尔积，再加上根节点之后，就构建成一颗二叉搜索树了。所谓的笛卡尔积就是在集合论中，两个集合中所有可能的有序对的集合。举例说明，一个序列[1,2,3,4,5,6]，以i=3，左边的序列[1,2]，右边的序列[4,5,6]。左边的序列，构建起来的二叉树搜索树的数量是$G(2)$，右边的序列，构建起来的二叉搜索树的数量是$G(3)$。这样我们就可以得到$F(3)=G(2) \\cdot G(3)$。也就是说，我们会发现，因为$G(n)$其实和输入序列内容无关，只和输入的不同序列的数量有关系。所以，我们得到如下公式：\n$$\nF(i,n)=G(i-1) \\cdot G(n-i) \\tag{2}\n$$\n将上面的公式(1)和公式(2)，合并一下，就可以得到，我们想要的最终结果：\n$$\nG(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}G(i-1) \\cdot G(n-i) \\tag{3}\n$$\n据此，我可以写下如下的代码：\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public long numTrees(int n) {\n        long[] tree = new long[n + 1];\n        tree[0] = 1;\n        tree[1] = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {\n            for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {\n                tree[i] += tree[j - 1] * tree[i - j];\n            }\n        }\n        return tree[n];\n    }\n}\n```\n当输入是35时，得到的结果是3116285494907301262，计算耗时为21ms。 以上就是我们的分析过程。\n\n## 2.方法二：数学公式\n从上面的推导，我们就可以发现，我们可以发现这是个数学上的公式，在数学上，我们上面推导出来的$G(n)$这个函数被称为卡塔兰数。具体的公式是：\n$$\nC_0=1,C_{n+1}=\\frac{2(2n+1)}{n+2}C_n\n$$\n\n这是一个在组合数学上非常出名的公式。其实这个公式和上面的动态规划思想是一样的，只是直观地给出来最终的结果，这里就不对卡塔兰数进行证明了。我们会发现这个答案的解的结果是呈爆炸增长的。\n \n# 五、动态规划与其他算法思想之间的关系\n\n## 1. 分治策略\n\n分治的思想是把一个问题分解成一系列的小问题，把问题的规模缩小到可以解决的程度，然后通过解决这些小问题，再合并之后，得到最终的结果。听上去和动态规划的想法是一样的。但其实是不一样的，动态规划是无数个无数个子问题的重复，是存在重复的子问题的。但是，分治思想是把问题拆解之后，变成一个个独立的小问题，并且和原问题描述是一致的，只是规模缩小了很多，再然后对计算结果进行合并，比如归并排序，就是把一堆的数组，平均的分成两半，然后在这两半里面进行排序，这就是典型的分治思想。还比如，快速排序，把数组随机的分成两半，然后不断地递归处理这些数组，来得到最终的结果，注意这里分成的这两半数是不一样的，而且还存在不断的递归，前面的子问题会影响到后面的子问题的情况。所以说，有没有重复子问题的出现，就是动态规划和分治最重要的差别。\n\n如果一个问题可以通过拆解成独立的子问题，然后再把一堆的独立子问题再合并到一起，那么一般情况下，就可以考虑使用分治策略。但是如果这种拆解之后的子问题中包含很多公共子问题的话，那么，使用分治的效率就会低很多，因为这个时候，会有很多的重复的公共来浪费算法的性能，这种时候，使用动态规划来解决也许是个不错的选择。\n\n## 2. 贪心算法\n\n贪心算法，是比较于分治和动态规划简单一些的方法，说简单，并不是说这种方法实现起来不难，而是说，相比较于分治和动态规划，它的复杂度很低，也相对容易理解。而且分治和动态规划是要穷举并覆盖原问题所有的情况的，但是贪心算法是可以不用覆盖到所有的情况，只要能得出最优的结果，就可以结束了。贪心算法不要求存在最优的结果，而首先考虑的是局部最优，通过一系列的局部最优，在有些情况下就会得到全局最优，即便不是全局最优的，也一般不会是最差的结果，如果是可以通过求解局部最优就能得到全局最优的话，那一定是可以使用贪心算法的。\n\n贪心算法的基本思路一般是，首先把原来的问题分解成若干个子问题，然后求解这些子问题，之后把这些子问题组合起来就得到最终的结果了。也同样的，贪心算法也要求，子问题是符合无后效性的，就是说，后面阶段的求解不会再去影响到前面结果的值，保证子问题的独立性。\n\n举个例子，比如柠檬水找零找零问题[^3]，一个柠檬水摊上，一杯水5美元，一次购买一杯，按顺序找零，顾客支付的面额只有5美元，10美元，20美元，按顺序支付，当场点清。初始时，你没有一分钱，给你一串付款数字，判断是否能够最终找零。\n\n这个问题就可以这样子来分析拆解。首先，如果给的是5美元，那可以直接收下，你的账户上5美元数量加一。然后，如果给的是10美元，那你只能找零5美元，然后你的户头上10美元的数量加一，5美元的数量减一。再然后，如果给的是20美元，有两种支付方式，一种是给一张10美元和一张5美元，一种是给三张5美元的，这样20美元的数量就加一，但是20美元并不能用于之后的支付，可以忽略，那就只需要统计10美元和5美元的数量即可，在这里，你需要尽可能使用第一种支付方式来支付，这样你手上的5美元数量会不断增加。\n\n整个过程，后面的的顾客支付的数字，不会影响到前面的数字，只要依据这三种情况来分段支付即可，直到手上美元数量，无法再进行后续的支付。这个过程，就是使用到了贪心算法，而之所以使用到贪心算法，是因为面值的的大小固定在5美元，10美元，20美元这三种上面，并且是按照顺序来支付的，所以按照贪心算法的思想，并不需要去求解所有的情况，只需要当前的数字是否能够满足条件位置，直到需要求解的结果出来即可，也就是说局部的最优解，就是全局的最优解，这符合我们的预期。\n\n分治策略、贪心算法和动态规划都和拆解子问题有关，区别只是关于子问题，有着不一样的要求，根据不同的分析，来解决实际中遇到的困难。分治和动态规划，都要求对最后得到的子问题全部解出来，但是贪心算法不需要，只要解到结果就可以了。贪心算法和动态规划，都要求设计的子问题是满足最优结构的，但是分治策略可以不是最优的子问题。\n\n# 六、总结\n\n本文主要通过两个案例来详细说明了动态规划是如何进行和思考的。案例一，是针对数位相关的动态规划的问题。在案例一中，我们会发现，使用动态规划的方法与单纯的使用暴力穷举法相比，性能有着非常大的提升。但这并不是说穷举法就没有效了。使用动态规划也是要穷举所有的子问题来处理的，但是当我们找不到合适的算法来解决问题时，使用简单暴力的穷举法，也可以成为我们的选择，虽然往往这样的情况下，会非常的耗时。\n\n案例二，是关于计数相关的动态规划的问题。通过拆解子问题，划分成解决左子树和右子树的序列，就可以递归的得到最终的结果。当然这是分析的过程。所以说，动态规划是一个算法思想，是帮助我们理解和分析问题的算法思想，就和分治策略和贪心算法是一样的。合理使用算法思想是可以到帮助我们的。\n\n同时，在最后要说一下，算法的分析方法有非常多的思路，不要局限在某个问题上，要合理应用，合理学习，这样才能更快更方便的得到问题的解。\n\n#

三、案例一，不含连续1的非负整数\n\n先来一道，关于数位动态规划的案例：\n> 给定一个正整数n，找出小于或等于n的非负整数中，其二进制表示不包含连续的1的个数。[^1]\n\n## 方法1. 最简单粗暴的方法\n\n首先我们用最简单粗暴的方法来计算一下这个案例，代码如下：\n\n```Java\nclass Solution {\n    public int findIntegers(int n) {\n        int result = n + 1;\n        for (int i = n; i > 0; i--) {\n            int nextNumber = i;\n            int remainder = nextNumber % 2;\n            while (nextNumber != 0) {\n                int lastRemainder = remainder;\n                nextNumber = nextNumber / 2;\n                remainder = nextNumber % 2;\n                if (lastRemainder == 1 && remainder == 1) {\n                    result--;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n以上方法，当输入是`2147483647`时，得到的结果是3524578，计算耗时为30063ms。 十进制转二进制的方法就是除二取余法，以上方法，从0~n，每个数都计算一遍，只要有出现连续的1，就在总数上减一，这样就可以得到最终的结果。\n\n## 方法2. 使用动态规划的思想来解析\n\n上面的方法最后的耗时显然是一个非常长的时间，那么我们该如何使用动态规划来分析这道题呢？按照暴力计算的思路，就是把全部的数都计算一遍，但显然没有这个必要去全部都去计算一遍。 举个例子，比如数字7，7转成二进制的数是`111`\n，转成二进制表示的话： 0 : 000，1 : 001，2 : 010，3 : 011，4 : 100，5 : 101，6 : 110，7 : 111\n\n以上符合条件的数，分别是`'0'`，`'1'`，`'10'`，`'100'`，`'101'`，一共5个数。我们可以把上面的数，使用二叉字典树的形式表达出来，如下图。\n\n{% mermaid graph TD %}\nroot(['110'])-->0((0))\nroot-->1((1))\n0-->00((0))\n0-->01((1))\n1-->10((0))\n1-->11((1))\n00-->000((0))\n00-->001((1))\n01-->010((0))\n01-->011((1))\n10-->100((0))\n10-->101((1))\n11-->110((0))\n11-->111((_))\n{% endmermaid %}\n\n可以发现，里面是会有很多重复计算的，当数字小的时候，这点儿耗时可以忽略，但是当数字很大的时候，这种计算就会是非常耗时的，有着更多无意义的重复计算。 先观察可以发现，当右子树，连续出现两个1的时候，代表着后面的数全部都是不符合要求的。\n\n也就是说，我们要计算的二进制表示中不含连续的1的数量，可以描述成要计算根节点为0的满二叉树中不含连续的1的路径数量。通过计算，我们可以列出来已知的一些结果。可以发现，要计算的根节点为0的满二叉树中不含连续1的路径数量，可以发现是上面2层不含连续1的路径数量之和。结果如下：\n\n|          |          |          |          |          |\n|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| f(2^0)=1 | f(2^1)=1 | f(2^2)=2 | f(2^3)=3 | f(2^3)=5 |\n\n我们依据斐波那契数列的关系，可以得出状态转移方程：\n\n$$\nf(2^n)= \\begin{cases} f(2^{n-1})+f(2^{n-2})& \\text{n}\\geq{2}\\ 1& \\text{n}<{2}  \\end{cases} \n$$\n\n最后的代码如下：\n\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int findIntegers(int n) {\n        List<Integer> data = new ArrayList<>();\n        //添加斐波那契数列的初始值\n        data.add(1);\n        data.add(1);\n        //利用斐波那契数列，计算出最大数的有效结果\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n            int val = 1 << i;\n            if (val >= 0 && val <= n) {\n                data.add(data.get(data.size() - 1) + data.get(data.size() - 2));\n            } else {\n                data.add(data.get(data.size() - 1) + data.get(data.size() - 2));\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        boolean haveOne = false;\n        int result = 0;\n        for (int i = data.size() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {\n            // << 位移，用来表示在二进制上，1向左移动了几位，比如 1 << 2 的结果是100，也就是十进制的4\n            int val = 1 << i;\n            // &位与，二进制数上只有当都是1时，才为1，用来筛选出最高位的1所在的位置\n            if ((n & val) != 0) {\n                //把已经出现的左边树的数都加上\n                result += data.get(i + 1);\n                //如果出现连续的1，这里跳出循环，代表的下面的数都不会再符合条件\n                if (haveOne) {\n                    break;\n                }\n                haveOne = true;\n            } else {\n                haveOne = false;\n            }\n            if (i == 0) {\n                //如果计算到了这里，需要再加1，因为0也是需要被计入符合条件的数字的\n                ++result;\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n输出的结果，在同一台电脑，同样的配置下，当输入是2147483647时，得到的结果是3524578，计算耗时为20ms。可以看到，相比较直接的暴力计算，最终的性能有了非常大的提升。\n\n# 四、案例二，不同的二叉搜索树\n\n这是一道关于计数问题的动态规划的案例：\n> 给你一个整数n，求恰由n个节点组成且节点值从1到n互不相同的二叉搜索树有多少种？返回满足题意的二叉搜索树的种数。[^2]\n\n## 1. 什么是二叉搜索树\n所谓的二叉搜索树，就是节点的左子树所有的值，一定小于该节点；右子树所有的值，一定大于该节点。比如，n=5时，可以得到：\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\ntree1_1((1))-->tree1_l[ ]\ntree1_1((1))-->tree1_2((3))\ntree1_2((3))-->tree1_3((2))\ntree1_2((3))-->tree1_r[ ]\n \ntree2_1((1))-->tree2_l[ ]\ntree2_1((1))-->tree2_2((2))\ntree2_2((2))-->tree2_r[

stroke:#FFFFFF,stroke-width:0px;\n```\n## 2.方法一： 使用动态规划的思想来解析\n要构建一颗二叉搜索树，我们可以把题目这样描述，给定一个有序的序列1\\~n，遍历这个序列，对于每个数字i来说，把$i$当做根节点，把1~(i-1)当做左子树，把(i+1)~n当做右子树，接着递归遍历这两个序列，重复前面的操作，最后计数，就可以得到我们要的结果。因为一开始遍历的时候，根的值不一样，我们可以认为，通过这种方式构建出来的二叉搜索树都是唯一的。\n\n接下来，我们定义两个函数，\n1. $G(n)$: 把题目要求的有序的序列1~n，构建起来的不同二叉树搜索树的计数个数，也就是我们最终想要得到的结果，这里和输入的序列的内容无关，只要是序列里面的数都不同就可以了，n表示数量。\n2. $F(i,n)$:以i为树的根，把1~(i-1)当做左子树，把(i+1)~n当做右子树构建起来的不同二叉树的计数个数，n表示数量，i表示根节点。\n\n根据上面的描述，我们可以得到如下的公式：\n$$\nG(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{F(i,n)} \\tag{1}\n$$\n\n首先，我们定义当n=1，或者n=2时，$G(n)=1,  G(n)=2$。\n\n接着，我们来计算$F(i,n)$，以i为树的根，计算的所有的二叉搜索树的集合，是左子树集合和右子树集合的笛卡尔积，再加上根节点之后，就构建成一颗二叉搜索树了。所谓的笛卡尔积就是在集合论中，两个集合中所有可能的有序对的集合。举例说明，一个序列[1,2,3,4,5,6]，以i=3，左边的序列[1,2]，右边的序列[4,5,6]。左边的序列，构建起来的二叉树搜索树的数量是$G(2)$，右边的序列，构建起来的二叉搜索树的数量是$G(3)$。这样我们就可以得到$F(3)=G(2) \\cdot G(3)$。也就是说，我们会发现，因为$G(n)$其实和输入序列内容无关，只和输入的不同序列的数量有关系。所以，我们得到如下公式：\n$$\nF(i,n)=G(i-1) \\cdot G(n-i) \\tag{2}\n$$\n将上面的公式(1)和公式(2)，合并一下，就可以得到，我们想要的最终结果：\n$$\nG(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}G(i-1) \\cdot G(n-i) \\tag{3}\n$$\n据此，我可以写下如下的代码：\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public long numTrees(int n) {\n        long[] tree = new long[n + 1];\n        tree[0] = 1;\n        tree[1] = 1;\n        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {\n            for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {\n                tree[i] += tree[j - 1] * tree[i - j];\n            }\n        }\n        return tree[n];\n    }\n}\n```\n当输入是35时，得到的结果是3116285494907301262，计算耗时为21ms。 以上就是我们的分析过程。\n\n## 2.方法二：数学公式\n从上面的推导，我们就可以发现，我们可以发现这是个数学上的公式，在数学上，我们上面推导出来的$G(n)$这个函数被称为卡塔兰数。具体的公式是：\n$$\nC_0=1,C_{n+1}=\\frac{2(2n+1)}{n+2}C_n\n$$\n\n这是一个在组合数学上非常出名的公式。其实这个公式和上面的动态规划思想是一样的，只是直观地给出来最终的结果，这里就不对卡塔兰数进行证明了。我们会发现这个答案的解的结果是呈爆炸增长的。\n \n# 五、动态规划与其他算法思想之间的关系\n\n## 1. 分治策略\n\n分治的思想是把一个问题分解成一系列的小问题，把问题的规模缩小到可以解决的程度，然后通过解决这些小问题，再合并之后，得到最终的结果。听上去和动态规划的想法是一样的。但其实是不一样的，动态规划是无数个无数个子问题的重复，是存在重复的子问题的。但是，分治思想是把问题拆解之后，变成一个个独立的小问题，并且和原问题描述是一致的，只是规模缩小了很多，再然后对计算结果进行合并，比如归并排序，就是把一堆的数组，平均的分成两半，然后在这两半里面进行排序，这就是典型的分治思想。还比如，快速排序，把数组随机的分成两半，然后不断地递归处理这些数组，来得到最终的结果，注意这里分成的这两半数是不一样的，而且还存在不断的递归，前面的子问题会影响到后面的子问题的情况。所以说，有没有重复子问题的出现，就是动态规划和分治最重要的差别。\n\n如果一个问题可以通过拆解成独立的子问题，然后再把一堆的独立子问题再合并到一起，那么一般情况下，就可以考虑使用分治策略。但是如果这种拆解之后的子问题中包含很多公共子问题的话，那么，使用分治的效率就会低很多，因为这个时候，会有很多的重复的公共来浪费算法的性能，这种时候，使用动态规划来解决也许是个不错的选择。\n\n## 2. 贪心算法\n\n贪心算法，是比较于分治和动态规划简单一些的方法，说简单，并不是说这种方法实现起来不难，而是说，相比较于分治和动态规划，它的复杂度很低，也相对容易理解。而且分治和动态规划是要穷举并覆盖原问题所有的情况的，但是贪心算法是可以不用覆盖到所有的情况，只要能得出最优的结果，就可以结束了。贪心算法不要求存在最优的结果，而首先考虑的是局部最优，通过一系列的局部最优，在有些情况下就会得到全局最优，即便不是全局最优的，也一般不会是最差的结果，如果是可以通过求解局部最优就能得到全局最优的话，那一定是可以使用贪心算法的。\n\n贪心算法的基本思路一般是，首先把原来的问题分解成若干个子问题，然后求解这些子问题，之后把这些子问题组合起来就得到最终的结果了。也同样的，贪心算法也要求，子问题是符合无后效性的，就是说，后面阶段的求解不会再去影响到前面结果的值，保证子问题的独立性。\n\n举个例子，比如柠檬水找零找零问题[^3]，一个柠檬水摊上，一杯水5美元，一次购买一杯，按顺序找零，顾客支付的面额只有5美元，10美元，20美元，按顺序支付，当场点清。初始时，你没有一分钱，给你一串付款数字，判断是否能够最终找零。\n\n这个问题就可以这样子来分析拆解。首先，如果给的是5美元，那可以直接收下，你的账户上5美元数量加一。然后，如果给的是10美元，那你只能找零5美元，然后你的户头上10美元的数量加一，5美元的数量减一。再然后，如果给的是20美元，有两种支付方式，一种是给一张10美元和一张5美元，一种是给三张5美元的，这样20美元的数量就加一，但是20美元并不能用于之后的支付，可以忽略，那就只需要统计10美元和5美元的数量即可，在这里，你需要尽可能使用第一种支付方式来支付，这样你手上的5美元数量会不断增加。\n\n整个过程，后面的的顾客支付的数字，不会影响到前面的数字，只要依据这三种情况来分段支付即可，直到手上美元数量，无法再进行后续的支付。这个过程，就是使用到了贪心算法，而之所以使用到贪心算法，是因为面值的的大小固定在5美元，10美元，20美元这三种上面，并且是按照顺序来支付的，所以按照贪心算法的思想，并不需要去求解所有的情况，只需要当前的数字是否能够满足条件位置，直到需要求解的结果出来即可，也就是说局部的最优解，就是全局的最优解，这符合我们的预期。\n\n分治策略、贪心算法和动态规划都和拆解子问题有关，区别只是关于子问题，有着不一样的要求，根据不同的分析，来解决实际中遇到的困难。分治和动态规划，都要求对最后得到的子问题全部解出来，但是贪心算法不需要，只要解到结果就可以了。贪心算法和动态规划，都要求设计的子问题是满足最优结构的，但是分治策略可以不是最优的子问题。\n\n# 六、总结\n\n本文主要通过两个案例来详细说明了动态规划是如何进行和思考的。案例一，是针对数位相关的动态规划的问题。在案例一中，我们会发现，使用动态规划的方法与单纯的使用暴力穷举法相比，性能有着非常大的提升。但这并不是说穷举法就没有效了。使用动态规划也是要穷举所有的子问题来处理的，但是当我们找不到合适的算法来解决问题时，使用简单暴力的穷举法，也可以成为我们的选择，虽然往往这样的情况下，会非常的耗时。\n\n案例二，是关于计数相关的动态规划的问题。通过拆解子问题，划分成解决左子树和右子树的序列，就可以递归的得到最终的结果。当然这是分析的过程。所以说，动态规划是一个算法思想，是帮助我们理解和分析问题的算法思想，就和分治策略和贪心算法是一样的。合理使用算法思想是可以到帮助我们的。\n\n同时，在最后要说一下，算法的分析方法有非常多的思路，不要局限在某个问题上，要合理应用，合理学习，这样才能更快更方便的得到问题的解。\n\n#

id=\"方法2.-使用动态规划的思想来解析\">方法2.\n使用动态规划的思想来解析</h2>\n<p>上面的方法最后的耗时显然是一个非常长的时间，那么我们该如何使用动态规划来分析这道题呢？按照暴力计算的思路，就是把全部的数都计算一遍，但显然没有这个必要去全部都去计算一遍。\n举个例子，比如数字7，7转成二进制的数是<code>111</code>\n，转成二进制表示的话： 0 : 000，1 : 001，2 : 010，3 : 011，4 : 100，5 :\n101，6 : 110，7 : 111</p>\n<p>以上符合条件的数，分别是<code>'0'</code>，<code>'1'</code>，<code>'10'</code>，<code>'100'</code>，<code>'101'</code>，一共5个数。我们可以把上面的数，使用二叉字典树的形式表达出来，如下图。</p>\n<pre>\n<code class=\"mermaid\">\ngraph

inline\">\\(i\\)</span>当做根节点，把1<sub>(i-1)当做左子树，把(i+1)</sub>n当做右子树，接着递归遍历这两个序列，重复前面的操作，最后计数，就可以得到我们要的结果。因为一开始遍历的时候，根的值不一样，我们可以认为，通过这种方式构建出来的二叉搜索树都是唯一的。</p>\n<p>接下来，我们定义两个函数， 1. <span\nclass=\"math inline\">\\(G(n)\\)</span>:\n把题目要求的有序的序列1~n，构建起来的不同二叉树搜索树的计数个数，也就是我们最终想要得到的结果，这里和输入的序列的内容无关，只要是序列里面的数都不同就可以了，n表示数量。\n2. <span\nclass=\"math inline\">\\(F(i,n)\\)</span>:以i为树的根，把1<sub>(i-1)当做左子树，把(i+1)</sub>n当做右子树构建起来的不同二叉树的计数个数，n表示数量，i表示根节点。</p>\n<p>根据上面的描述，我们可以得到如下的公式： <span\nclass=\"math display\">\\[\nG(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{F(i,n)} \\tag{1}\n\\]</span></p>\n<p>首先，我们定义当n=1，或者n=2时，<span class=\"math inline\">\\(G(n)=1,\nG(n)=2\\)</span>。</p>\n<p>接着，我们来计算<span\nclass=\"math inline\">\\(F(i,n)\\)</span>，以i为树的根，计算的所有的二叉搜索树的集合，是左子树集合和右子树集合的笛卡尔积，再加上根节点之后，就构建成一颗二叉搜索树了。所谓的笛卡尔积就是在集合论中，两个集合中所有可能的有序对的集合。举例说明，一个序列[1,2,3,4,5,6]，以i=3，左边的序列[1,2]，右边的序列[4,5,6]。左边的序列，构建起来的二叉树搜索树的数量是<span\nclass=\"math inline\">\\(G(2)\\)</span>，右边的序列，构建起来的二叉搜索树的数量是<span\nclass=\"math inline\">\\(G(3)\\)</span>。这样我们就可以得到<span\nclass=\"math inline\">\\(F(3)=G(2) \\cdot\nG(3)\\)</span>。也就是说，我们会发现，因为<span\nclass=\"math inline\">\\(G(n)\\)</span>其实和输入序列内容无关，只和输入的不同序列的数量有关系。所以，我们得到如下公式：\n<span class=\"math display\">\\[\nF(i,n)=G(i-1) \\cdot G(n-i) \\tag{2}\n\\]</span>\n将上面的公式(1)和公式(2)，合并一下，就可以得到，我们想要的最终结果：\n<span

id=\"分治策略\">1. 分治策略</h2>\n<p>分治的思想是把一个问题分解成一系列的小问题，把问题的规模缩小到可以解决的程度，然后通过解决这些小问题，再合并之后，得到最终的结果。听上去和动态规划的想法是一样的。但其实是不一样的，动态规划是无数个无数个子问题的重复，是存在重复的子问题的。但是，分治思想是把问题拆解之后，变成一个个独立的小问题，并且和原问题描述是一致的，只是规模缩小了很多，再然后对计算结果进行合并，比如归并排序，就是把一堆的数组，平均的分成两半，然后在这两半里面进行排序，这就是典型的分治思想。还比如，快速排序，把数组随机的分成两半，然后不断地递归处理这些数组，来得到最终的结果，注意这里分成的这两半数是不一样的，而且还存在不断的递归，前面的子问题会影响到后面的子问题的情况。所以说，有没有重复子问题的出现，就是动态规划和分治最重要的差别。</p>\n<p>如果一个问题可以通过拆解成独立的子问题，然后再把一堆的独立子问题再合并到一起，那么一般情况下，就可以考虑使用分治策略。但是如果这种拆解之后的子问题中包含很多公共子问题的话，那么，使用分治的效率就会低很多，因为这个时候，会有很多的重复的公共来浪费算法的性能，这种时候，使用动态规划来解决也许是个不错的选择。</p>\n<h2 id=\"贪心算法\">2. 贪心算法</h2>\n<p>贪心算法，是比较于分治和动态规划简单一些的方法，说简单，并不是说这种方法实现起来不难，而是说，相比较于分治和动态规划，它的复杂度很低，也相对容易理解。而且分治和动态规划是要穷举并覆盖原问题所有的情况的，但是贪心算法是可以不用覆盖到所有的情况，只要能得出最优的结果，就可以结束了。贪心算法不要求存在最优的结果，而首先考虑的是局部最优，通过一系列的局部最优，在有些情况下就会得到全局最优，即便不是全局最优的，也一般不会是最差的结果，如果是可以通过求解局部最优就能得到全局最优的话，那一定是可以使用贪心算法的。</p>\n<p>贪心算法的基本思路一般是，首先把原来的问题分解成若干个子问题，然后求解这些子问题，之后把这些子问题组合起来就得到最终的结果了。也同样的，贪心算法也要求，子问题是符合无后效性的，就是说，后面阶段的求解不会再去影响到前面结果的值，保证子问题的独立性。</p>\n<p>举个例子，比如柠檬水找零找零问题<a href=\"#fn3\" class=\"footnote-ref\"\nid=\"fnref3\"\nrole=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>3</sup></a>，一个柠檬水摊上，一杯水5美元，一次购买一杯，按顺序找零，顾客支付的面额只有5美元，10美元，20美元，按顺序支付，当场点清。初始时，你没有一分钱，给你一串付款数字，判断是否能够最终找零。</p>\n<p>这个问题就可以这样子来分析拆解。首先，如果给的是5美元，那可以直接收下，你的账户上5美元数量加一。然后，如果给的是10美元，那你只能找零5美元，然后你的户头上10美元的数量加一，5美元的数量减一。再然后，如果给的是20美元，有两种支付方式，一种是给一张10美元和一张5美元，一种是给三张5美元的，这样20美元的数量就加一，但是20美元并不能用于之后的支付，可以忽略，那就只需要统计10美元和5美元的数量即可，在这里，你需要尽可能使用第一种支付方式来支付，这样你手上的5美元数量会不断增加。</p>\n<p>整个过程，后面的的顾客支付的数字，不会影响到前面的数字，只要依据这三种情况来分段支付即可，直到手上美元数量，无法再进行后续的支付。这个过程，就是使用到了贪心算法，而之所以使用到贪心算法，是因为面值的的大小固定在5美元，10美元，20美元这三种上面，并且是按照顺序来支付的，所以按照贪心算法的思想，并不需要去求解所有的情况，只需要当前的数字是否能够满足条件位置，直到需要求解的结果出来即可，也就是说局部的最优解，就是全局的最优解，这符合我们的预期。</p>\n<p>分治策略、贪心算法和动态规划都和拆解子问题有关，区别只是关于子问题，有着不一样的要求，根据不同的分析，来解决实际中遇到的困难。分治和动态规划，都要求对最后得到的子问题全部解出来，但是贪心算法不需要，只要解到结果就可以了。贪心算法和动态规划，都要求设计的子问题是满足最优结构的，但是分治策略可以不是最优的子问题。</p>\n<h1 id=\"六总结\">六、总结</h1>\n<p>本文主要通过两个案例来详细说明了动态规划是如何进行和思考的。案例一，是针对数位相关的动态规划的问题。在案例一中，我们会发现，使用动态规划的方法与单纯的使用暴力穷举法相比，性能有着非常大的提升。但这并不是说穷举法就没有效了。使用动态规划也是要穷举所有的子问题来处理的，但是当我们找不到合适的算法来解决问题时，使用简单暴力的穷举法，也可以成为我们的选择，虽然往往这样的情况下，会非常的耗时。</p>\n<p>案例二，是关于计数相关的动态规划的问题。通过拆解子问题，划分成解决左子树和右子树的序列，就可以递归的得到最终的结果。当然这是分析的过程。所以说，动态规划是一个算法思想，是帮助我们理解和分析问题的算法思想，就和分治策略和贪心算法是一样的。合理使用算法思想是可以到帮助我们的。</p>\n<p>同时，在最后要说一下，算法的分析方法有非常多的思路，不要局限在某个问题上，要合理应用，合理学习，这样才能更快更方便的得到问题的解。</p>\n<h1

id=\"一引言\">一、引言</h1>\n<p>生活中会遇到很多的问题，在使用代码来进行抽象逻辑的时候，有时候会需要抽象成数学上的算法，来提高处理的效率。因为计算机的资源是有限的，并不能简单地、暴力地帮我们处理所有的问题。而且，很多重复的工作，也有必要通过抽象成算法来简化。比如举一个常见的例子，从1~n累加的和，就可以通过高斯算法来表示，得到(1+n)*n/2这样的结果，这样可以大大简化运算的步骤，从而提高算法的效率。同样的例子还有很多。算法可以有效的帮助到我们。</p>\n<p>常用的有几大算法，分别是分治法、贪婪算法、动态规划、穷举法。当然还有一些分支定界法、回朔法、哈希表、深度优先搜索等等，在这里不做主要的介绍，在这里，主要介绍的是动态规划以及和动态规划思想有关算法的一些区别和需要注意的地方。</p>\n<h1 id=\"二何为动态规划\">二、何为动态规划</h1>\n<p>动态规划（英文名称是：dynamic\nprogramming，这里的programing不是指程序代码，而是一种方法，一种算法思想）是解决某一类算法的思想，通过组合子问题的解，来求解最优解的方法。广泛应用在计算机科学、数学、生物信息学还有管理学科和经济学当中，通过把复杂的问题拆解成相对简单一些的子问题来求解。这样，通过分解成子问题，再通过子问题的最优集合，我们就可以方便的解决原来可能很复杂的问题。</p>\n<p>关于子问题，有两个概念是需要了解的，第一个是最优子结构，动态规划要解决的，就是从一堆问题的解决方案中，寻找问题的最优解，当然这种最优解可能不存在，也可能用动态规划是无法寻找和找不到的。当找到最优解之后，通过把最优解拼装起来，就可以得到最后的解了。</p>\n<p>如果问题比较复杂的话，那么非常有可能不止只有一个最优解，甚至，最优解也可以是一堆最优解的结合，这就是第二个关于子问题需要了解的，就是重复子问题。遇到这种情况，一般就需要通用递归重复子问题来得到最终的结果，当重复的子问题很多的时候，动态规划可以帮助我们减少很多重复的计算量。但是如果在使用递归方法来解决算法问题时，没有出现可以重复的子问题，那么就没必要非要使用动态规划的思想来解决，一般的递归方法也是可以很好地胜任的。</p>\n<p>还有一个关于子问题的概念是，无后效性，也就是说每个子问题可以是相互独立的，在推导的过程中，后面的结果不该再去对这个子问题的结果产生影响。这一点也很重要，因为动态规划一般都是自顶向下来进行的，如果是子问题之间相互关联性很大的话，那就说明，这并不需要来通过动态规划来处理，也会严重影响到最后的算法的效率问题，或者这个算法有可能无法在有限的时间内终止，这都是不符合我们预期的。</p>\n<p>我们可以这样说，寻找一个问题的子问题，并且完善子问题之间的关系的，写出状态转移方程，就是动态规划思想的基本思想过程了。也基本上可以说，如果能够证明，该问题存在最优的子问题，并且能够通过子问题的不断重复递归来得到最终的最优解，那么就说明该问题适合使用动态规划来解答。</p>\n<p>以下通过几个案例，来详细解答这个过程。</p>\n<h1\nid=\"三案例一不含连续1的非负整数\">三、案例一，不含连续1的非负整数</h1>\n<p>先来一道，关于数位动态规划的案例： &gt;\n给定一个正整数n，找出小于或等于n的非负整数中，其二进制表示不包含连续的1的个数。<a\nhref=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref1\"\nrole=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n<h2 id=\"方法1.-最简单粗暴的方法\">方法1.

id=\"方法2.-使用动态规划的思想来解析\">方法2.\n使用动态规划的思想来解析</h2>\n<p>上面的方法最后的耗时显然是一个非常长的时间，那么我们该如何使用动态规划来分析这道题呢？按照暴力计算的思路，就是把全部的数都计算一遍，但显然没有这个必要去全部都去计算一遍。\n举个例子，比如数字7，7转成二进制的数是<code>111</code>\n，转成二进制表示的话： 0 : 000，1 : 001，2 : 010，3 : 011，4 : 100，5 :\n101，6 : 110，7 : 111</p>\n<p>以上符合条件的数，分别是<code>'0'</code>，<code>'1'</code>，<code>'10'</code>，<code>'100'</code>，<code>'101'</code>，一共5个数。我们可以把上面的数，使用二叉字典树的形式表达出来，如下图。</p>\n<pre>\n<code class=\"mermaid\">\ngraph TD\nroot([&#39;110&#39;])--&gt;0((0))\nroot--&gt;1((1))\n0--&gt;00((0))\n0--&gt;01((1))\n1--&gt;10((0))\n1--&gt;11((1))\n00--&gt;000((0))\n00--&gt;001((1))\n01--&gt;010((0))\n01--&gt;011((1))\n10--&gt;100((0))\n10--&gt;101((1))\n11--&gt;110((0))\n11--&gt;111((_))\n</code>\n</pre>\n<p>可以发现，里面是会有很多重复计算的，当数字小的时候，这点儿耗时可以忽略，但是当数字很大的时候，这种计算就会是非常耗时的，有着更多无意义的重复计算。\n先观察可以发现，当右子树，连续出现两个1的时候，代表着后面的数全部都是不符合要求的。</p>\n<p>也就是说，我们要计算的二进制表示中不含连续的1的数量，可以描述成要计算根节点为0的满二叉树中不含连续的1的路径数量。通过计算，我们可以列出来已知的一些结果。可以发现，要计算的根节点为0的满二叉树中不含连续1的路径数量，可以发现是上面2层不含连续1的路径数量之和。结果如下：</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td>f(2^0)=1</td>\n<td>f(2^1)=1</td>\n<td>f(2^2)=2</td>\n<td>f(2^3)=3</td>\n<td>f(2^3)=5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>我们依据斐波那契数列的关系，可以得出状态转移方程：</p>\n<p><span class=\"math

inline\">\\(i\\)</span>当做根节点，把1<sub>(i-1)当做左子树，把(i+1)</sub>n当做右子树，接着递归遍历这两个序列，重复前面的操作，最后计数，就可以得到我们要的结果。因为一开始遍历的时候，根的值不一样，我们可以认为，通过这种方式构建出来的二叉搜索树都是唯一的。</p>\n<p>接下来，我们定义两个函数， 1. <span\nclass=\"math inline\">\\(G(n)\\)</span>:\n把题目要求的有序的序列1~n，构建起来的不同二叉树搜索树的计数个数，也就是我们最终想要得到的结果，这里和输入的序列的内容无关，只要是序列里面的数都不同就可以了，n表示数量。\n2. <span\nclass=\"math

\\tag{1}\n\\]</span></p>\n<p>首先，我们定义当n=1，或者n=2时，<span class=\"math inline\">\\(G(n)=1,\nG(n)=2\\)</span>。</p>\n<p>接着，我们来计算<span\nclass=\"math inline\">\\(F(i,n)\\)</span>，以i为树的根，计算的所有的二叉搜索树的集合，是左子树集合和右子树集合的笛卡尔积，再加上根节点之后，就构建成一颗二叉搜索树了。所谓的笛卡尔积就是在集合论中，两个集合中所有可能的有序对的集合。举例说明，一个序列[1,2,3,4,5,6]，以i=3，左边的序列[1,2]，右边的序列[4,5,6]。左边的序列，构建起来的二叉树搜索树的数量是<span\nclass=\"math

display\">\\[\nC_0=1,C_{n+1}=\\frac{2(2n+1)}{n+2}C_n\n\\]</span></p>\n<p>这是一个在组合数学上非常出名的公式。其实这个公式和上面的动态规划思想是一样的，只是直观地给出来最终的结果，这里就不对卡塔兰数进行证明了。我们会发现这个答案的解的结果是呈爆炸增长的。</p>\n<h1\nid=\"五动态规划与其他算法思想之间的关系\">五、动态规划与其他算法思想之间的关系</h1>\n<h2 id=\"分治策略\">1. 分治策略</h2>\n<p>分治的思想是把一个问题分解成一系列的小问题，把问题的规模缩小到可以解决的程度，然后通过解决这些小问题，再合并之后，得到最终的结果。听上去和动态规划的想法是一样的。但其实是不一样的，动态规划是无数个无数个子问题的重复，是存在重复的子问题的。但是，分治思想是把问题拆解之后，变成一个个独立的小问题，并且和原问题描述是一致的，只是规模缩小了很多，再然后对计算结果进行合并，比如归并排序，就是把一堆的数组，平均的分成两半，然后在这两半里面进行排序，这就是典型的分治思想。还比如，快速排序，把数组随机的分成两半，然后不断地递归处理这些数组，来得到最终的结果，注意这里分成的这两半数是不一样的，而且还存在不断的递归，前面的子问题会影响到后面的子问题的情况。所以说，有没有重复子问题的出现，就是动态规划和分治最重要的差别。</p>\n<p>如果一个问题可以通过拆解成独立的子问题，然后再把一堆的独立子问题再合并到一起，那么一般情况下，就可以考虑使用分治策略。但是如果这种拆解之后的子问题中包含很多公共子问题的话，那么，使用分治的效率就会低很多，因为这个时候，会有很多的重复的公共来浪费算法的性能，这种时候，使用动态规划来解决也许是个不错的选择。</p>\n<h2 id=\"贪心算法\">2. 贪心算法</h2>\n<p>贪心算法，是比较于分治和动态规划简单一些的方法，说简单，并不是说这种方法实现起来不难，而是说，相比较于分治和动态规划，它的复杂度很低，也相对容易理解。而且分治和动态规划是要穷举并覆盖原问题所有的情况的，但是贪心算法是可以不用覆盖到所有的情况，只要能得出最优的结果，就可以结束了。贪心算法不要求存在最优的结果，而首先考虑的是局部最优，通过一系列的局部最优，在有些情况下就会得到全局最优，即便不是全局最优的，也一般不会是最差的结果，如果是可以通过求解局部最优就能得到全局最优的话，那一定是可以使用贪心算法的。</p>\n<p>贪心算法的基本思路一般是，首先把原来的问题分解成若干个子问题，然后求解这些子问题，之后把这些子问题组合起来就得到最终的结果了。也同样的，贪心算法也要求，子问题是符合无后效性的，就是说，后面阶段的求解不会再去影响到前面结果的值，保证子问题的独立性。</p>\n<p>举个例子，比如柠檬水找零找零问题<a href=\"#fn3\" class=\"footnote-ref\"\nid=\"fnref3\"\nrole=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>3</sup></a>，一个柠檬水摊上，一杯水5美元，一次购买一杯，按顺序找零，顾客支付的面额只有5美元，10美元，20美元，按顺序支付，当场点清。初始时，你没有一分钱，给你一串付款数字，判断是否能够最终找零。</p>\n<p>这个问题就可以这样子来分析拆解。首先，如果给的是5美元，那可以直接收下，你的账户上5美元数量加一。然后，如果给的是10美元，那你只能找零5美元，然后你的户头上10美元的数量加一，5美元的数量减一。再然后，如果给的是20美元，有两种支付方式，一种是给一张10美元和一张5美元，一种是给三张5美元的，这样20美元的数量就加一，但是20美元并不能用于之后的支付，可以忽略，那就只需要统计10美元和5美元的数量即可，在这里，你需要尽可能使用第一种支付方式来支付，这样你手上的5美元数量会不断增加。</p>\n<p>整个过程，后面的的顾客支付的数字，不会影响到前面的数字，只要依据这三种情况来分段支付即可，直到手上美元数量，无法再进行后续的支付。这个过程，就是使用到了贪心算法，而之所以使用到贪心算法，是因为面值的的大小固定在5美元，10美元，20美元这三种上面，并且是按照顺序来支付的，所以按照贪心算法的思想，并不需要去求解所有的情况，只需要当前的数字是否能够满足条件位置，直到需要求解的结果出来即可，也就是说局部的最优解，就是全局的最优解，这符合我们的预期。</p>\n<p>分治策略、贪心算法和动态规划都和拆解子问题有关，区别只是关于子问题，有着不一样的要求，根据不同的分析，来解决实际中遇到的困难。分治和动态规划，都要求对最后得到的子问题全部解出来，但是贪心算法不需要，只要解到结果就可以了。贪心算法和动态规划，都要求设计的子问题是满足最优结构的，但是分治策略可以不是最优的子问题。</p>\n<h1 id=\"六总结\">六、总结</h1>\n<p>本文主要通过两个案例来详细说明了动态规划是如何进行和思考的。案例一，是针对数位相关的动态规划的问题。在案例一中，我们会发现，使用动态规划的方法与单纯的使用暴力穷举法相比，性能有着非常大的提升。但这并不是说穷举法就没有效了。使用动态规划也是要穷举所有的子问题来处理的，但是当我们找不到合适的算法来解决问题时，使用简单暴力的穷举法，也可以成为我们的选择，虽然往往这样的情况下，会非常的耗时。</p>\n<p>案例二，是关于计数相关的动态规划的问题。通过拆解子问题，划分成解决左子树和右子树的序列，就可以递归的得到最终的结果。当然这是分析的过程。所以说，动态规划是一个算法思想，是帮助我们理解和分析问题的算法思想，就和分治策略和贪心算法是一样的。合理使用算法思想是可以到帮助我们的。</p>\n<p>同时，在最后要说一下，算法的分析方法有非常多的思路，不要局限在某个问题上，要合理应用，合理学习，这样才能更快更方便的得到问题的解。</p>\n<h1

'a']++;\n            max = Math.max(hash[c - 'a'], max);\n        }\n        if (max == 1) return true;\n        int countMax = 0, countMin = 0, min = max;\n        for (Integer value : hash) {\n            if (value == 0) continue;\n            if (value < min) {\n                countMin = 1;\n            } else if (value == min) {\n                countMin++;\n            }\n            min = Math.min(value, min);\n            if (value == max) {\n                countMax++;\n            }\n        }\n        if (countMax == word.length()) return word.length() <= 2;\n        if (countMax == 1) {\n            return max - min == 1 || max - min == 0 || (countMin == 1 && min == 1 && max + min == word.length());\n        } else {\n            return countMin == 1 && min == 1 && ((countMax * max + countMin) == word.length());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n以上代码在本地执行的时候，当输入是s:wordgoodgoodgoodd时，得到的结果是false计算耗时为23ms。当输入是s:abbbcccdddeeefff时，得到的结果是true计算耗时为24ms。在leetcode上执行用时：0ms，计算的很快就得到了结果。因为环境的差异，大家在比较算法的效率高低的时候，以leetcode上的为准。\n\n# 四、串联所有单词的子串\n题目描述：\n>给定一个字符串s和一个字符串数组words。words中所有字符串长度相同。s中的串联子串是指一个包含words中所有字符串以任意顺序排列连接起来的子串，比如words = [\"ab\",\"cd\",\"ef\"]，那么\"abcdef\"，\"abefcd\"，\"cdabef\"，\"cdefab\"，\"efabcd\"，和\"efcdab\" 都是串联子串。\"acdbef\"不是串联子串，因为他不是任何words排列的连接。返回所有串联字串在s中的开始索引。你可以以任意顺序返回答案。[^2]\n\n## 方法一\n看到这样的问题时，最简单的做法是，首先生成word数组中的全排列，生成全排列的方法有很多，比如邻位对换法、回溯算法等等，这里不做赘述，但是无论是何种全排列方法，随着word数组中的数量增加，最后的时间复杂度都是指数级增长的，最后有可能会花费相当长的时间来生成全排列，如果电脑资源不够的话，甚至会生成失败，对资源是一种极大的浪费。所以看到这样的问题，如何缩短时间复杂度呢？问题的关键就是如何处理关键字。\n\n滑动窗口也叫双指针，是我们在设计算法的时候的一个很有用的方法。在面对需要我们处理字符串的情况下，可以设计一个窗口，窗口的大小可以是固定的，也可以动态变化的，之后按照一定的方向依次去扫描字符串或者数组或者其他的数据形式，然后在每次扫描之后处理窗口中出现的字符串或者数组或者其他的数据。在本问题中，首先统计下words中字符串出现的次数然后保存在wordMap中，当做我们当前要比较的哈希表，这样在之后进行比较的时候就不用每次都再来计算一遍wordMap了。因为words中所有的字符串长度相同，所以可以把单个字符串的长度记为wordLength，把words的字符数量记为n，那words中所有的字符串拼到一起，可以组成的字符串的长度是maxWordLength。然后从左往右，每次开始的时候复制一份wordMap到diffMap中，作为当前比较的哈希表，依次读取n个长度为wordLength的字符串，然后判断是否在diffMap中，如果出现了不存在于diffMap中的字符串，就代表该次读取出来的字符串不符合要求，直接开始下一轮读取。那如何判断该次读取出的字符串是否存在于diffMap中呢？可以把diffMap中的对应的值减1，一直减到如果出现小于0的情况出现，就表示当前的读取出来的字符串不符合要求，因为每次读取出来的都是n个字符串，在进行减1操作的时候，除非全部符合diffMap的字符数，否者就会出现某一个关键字减1之后小于0的情况出现，这样就可以就可以简化运算，也就是说除非出现小于0的情况，除此之外就表示都是符合要求的。\n\n实现的代码如下，在leetcode上执行用时：91ms。\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {\n        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();\n        if (words.length == 0) return result;\n        int wordLength = words[0].length(), maxWordLength = wordLength * words.length;\n        Map<String, Integer> wordMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (String word : words) {\n            wordMap.put(word, wordMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n        Map<String, Integer> diffMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - maxWordLength + 1; i++) {\n            diffMap.clear();\n            diffMap.putAll(wordMap);\n            boolean haveIndex = true;\n            for (int n = 0; n < words.length; n++) {\n                String word = s.substring(i + n * wordLength, i + (n + 1) * wordLength);\n                int value = diffMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) - 1;\n                if (value >= 0) {\n                    diffMap.put(word, value);\n                } else {\n                    haveIndex = false;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (haveIndex) {\n                result.add(i);\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n## 方法二\n如果仔细观察，就会发现以上的算法存在一种浪费的情况，那就是每次读取了n个字符串出来做比较的时候，会发现是存在重复读取字符串来比较的。基于此，可以优化以上的算法。在初始化wordMap的时候，都标记为负数，作为哈希表。从左往右读取，记字符串s的长度为ls，记开始读取字符串的位置i，记words中的单个字符串长度为wordLength，words的字符串数量记为n，从i开始，读取n个长度为wordLength的字符串，那就是把i~ls的字符串划分为数个长度为wordLength的字符串，这样，最后几个不满足wordLength的字符串就可以舍弃掉了，因为无法构成一个符合要求的字符串了。\n\n设计好了滑动的窗口，然后就是开始移动，每次开始移动的时候，把wordMap中的数据写入到diffMap中初始化diffMap作为当前的哈希表，每次移动一个长度为wordLength的字符串，然后给diffMap中对应的值加1，如果出现了等于0的情况就删除该键值，如果diffMap中刚好全都被移除了，表示刚好符合要求，记录下当前的值，除此之外表示全都不满足要求。需要注意的是，外层循环的部分，只需要0~wordLength-1次，因为wordLength长度的字符串才能符合要求，所以实际上的开始位置在wordLength位置上的时候，就已经在第一轮的滑动窗口中比较过了。\n\n最终的实现代码如下，在leetcode上执行用时：11ms。\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {\n        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();\n        if (words.length == 0) return result;\n        int wordLength = words[0].length(), maxWordLength = wordLength * words.length;\n        Map<String, Integer> wordMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (String word : words) {\n            wordMap.put(word, wordMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) - 1);\n        }\n        Map<String, Integer> diffMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < wordLength && i + maxWordLength <= s.length(); i++) {\n            diffMap.clear();\n            diffMap.putAll(wordMap);\n            for (int j = 0; i + (j + 1) * wordLength <= s.length(); j++) {\n                int startIndex = i + j * wordLength;\n                int endIndex = i + (j + 1) * wordLength;\n                if (j >= words.length) {\n                    String firstWord = s.substring(startIndex - maxWordLength, endIndex - maxWordLength);\n                    int value = diffMap.getOrDefault(firstWord, 0) - 1;\n                    if (value == 0) {\n                        diffMap.remove(firstWord);\n                    } else {\n                        diffMap.put(firstWord, value);\n                    }\n                }\n                String nextWord = s.substring(startIndex, endIndex);\n                int value = diffMap.getOrDefault(nextWord, 0) + 1;\n                if (value != 0) {\n                    diffMap.put(nextWord, value);\n                } else {\n                    diffMap.remove(nextWord);\n                    if (diffMap.isEmpty()) {\n                        result.add(endIndex - maxWordLength);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n可以看到相比于方法一，速度提高了8倍。滑动窗口往往可以和其他算法相互结合，比如堆栈、队列，根据实际的需要，可以帮助提高算的效率。在利用哈希表来设计算的时候，如果可以使用到滑动窗口的话会非常的有用。\n\n# 五、直线上最多的点数\n题目描述：\n>给你一个数组points，其中 points[i] = [xi, yi] 表示 X-Y 平面上的一个点。求最多有多少个点在同一条直线上。[^3]\n \n看到这样的描述，可以显而易见的发现，这是一个二维平面坐标，也就是可以使用二元一次函数来表示是，也就是**y=ax+b**形式的函数，其中的特例是**x=c**(c表示一个常数)，二元一次方程都可以用上面的函数来表示，用这样的函数形式就可以表示X-Y平面上所有的直线了。这样的话就可以用两个点来表示一条直线了，然后只需要判断剩下的点是否在当前这条直线上就可以了。那我们借此来构建哈希函数，然后按照分桶算法来给点分组，然后计数，然后输出其中最大的值即可。\n\n分桶算法就是很直观的一种哈希思想实现，按照关键词，把数据分成多组，然后对数组进行处理，每个桶分别维护自己内部的数据，然后管理每个桶就可以了。在本问题中因为两点成一条直线，所以可以用[xi, yi]和[xi+1, yi+1]两两相减，然后就可以按照**y=ax+b**来计算出a和b，或者当x坐标都一样的时候就可以按照**x=c**来计算出c，对于**y=ax+b**的形式，首先按照a分成一组，然后在这一组数据中再按照b再进行一次划分，细划分出新的桶来，另外对于**x=c**的形式，把c作为关键字划分出数据来当做一个桶。以a、b、c作为哈希表的关键字分别计算，这样的话就可以把数据分到一个个的桶中，然后再去计数有多少点是一条直接上的就可以了。\n\n以下是代码实现，在leetcode上执行用时: 29ms。\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public int maxPoints(int[][] points) {\n        if (points.length <= 2) return points.length;\n        int result = 0;\n        Map<Float, Map<Float, Set<int[]>>> map = new HashMap<>();\n        Map<Integer, Set<int[]>> xMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < points.length - 1; i++) {\n            for (int f = i + 1; f < points.length; f++) {\n                float dx = (float) points[i][0] - points[f][0];\n                float dy = (float) points[i][1] - points[f][1];\n                float pi = dy / dx;\n                float b = points[i][1] -

'a']++;\n            max = Math.max(hash[c - 'a'], max);\n        }\n        if (max == 1) return true;\n        int countMax = 0, countMin = 0, min = max;\n        for (Integer value : hash) {\n            if (value == 0) continue;\n            if (value < min) {\n                countMin = 1;\n            } else if (value == min) {\n                countMin++;\n            }\n            min = Math.min(value, min);\n            if (value == max) {\n                countMax++;\n            }\n        }\n        if (countMax == word.length()) return word.length() <= 2;\n        if (countMax == 1) {\n            return max - min == 1 || max - min == 0 || (countMin == 1 && min == 1 && max + min == word.length());\n        } else {\n            return countMin == 1 && min == 1 && ((countMax * max + countMin) == word.length());\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n以上代码在本地执行的时候，当输入是s:wordgoodgoodgoodd时，得到的结果是false计算耗时为23ms。当输入是s:abbbcccdddeeefff时，得到的结果是true计算耗时为24ms。在leetcode上执行用时：0ms，计算的很快就得到了结果。因为环境的差异，大家在比较算法的效率高低的时候，以leetcode上的为准。\n\n# 四、串联所有单词的子串\n题目描述：\n>给定一个字符串s和一个字符串数组words。words中所有字符串长度相同。s中的串联子串是指一个包含words中所有字符串以任意顺序排列连接起来的子串，比如words = [\"ab\",\"cd\",\"ef\"]，那么\"abcdef\"，\"abefcd\"，\"cdabef\"，\"cdefab\"，\"efabcd\"，和\"efcdab\" 都是串联子串。\"acdbef\"不是串联子串，因为他不是任何words排列的连接。返回所有串联字串在s中的开始索引。你可以以任意顺序返回答案。[^2]\n\n## 方法一\n看到这样的问题时，最简单的做法是，首先生成word数组中的全排列，生成全排列的方法有很多，比如邻位对换法、回溯算法等等，这里不做赘述，但是无论是何种全排列方法，随着word数组中的数量增加，最后的时间复杂度都是指数级增长的，最后有可能会花费相当长的时间来生成全排列，如果电脑资源不够的话，甚至会生成失败，对资源是一种极大的浪费。所以看到这样的问题，如何缩短时间复杂度呢？问题的关键就是如何处理关键字。\n\n滑动窗口也叫双指针，是我们在设计算法的时候的一个很有用的方法。在面对需要我们处理字符串的情况下，可以设计一个窗口，窗口的大小可以是固定的，也可以动态变化的，之后按照一定的方向依次去扫描字符串或者数组或者其他的数据形式，然后在每次扫描之后处理窗口中出现的字符串或者数组或者其他的数据。在本问题中，首先统计下words中字符串出现的次数然后保存在wordMap中，当做我们当前要比较的哈希表，这样在之后进行比较的时候就不用每次都再来计算一遍wordMap了。因为words中所有的字符串长度相同，所以可以把单个字符串的长度记为wordLength，把words的字符数量记为n，那words中所有的字符串拼到一起，可以组成的字符串的长度是maxWordLength。然后从左往右，每次开始的时候复制一份wordMap到diffMap中，作为当前比较的哈希表，依次读取n个长度为wordLength的字符串，然后判断是否在diffMap中，如果出现了不存在于diffMap中的字符串，就代表该次读取出来的字符串不符合要求，直接开始下一轮读取。那如何判断该次读取出的字符串是否存在于diffMap中呢？可以把diffMap中的对应的值减1，一直减到如果出现小于0的情况出现，就表示当前的读取出来的字符串不符合要求，因为每次读取出来的都是n个字符串，在进行减1操作的时候，除非全部符合diffMap的字符数，否者就会出现某一个关键字减1之后小于0的情况出现，这样就可以就可以简化运算，也就是说除非出现小于0的情况，除此之外就表示都是符合要求的。\n\n实现的代码如下，在leetcode上执行用时：91ms。\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {\n        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();\n        if (words.length == 0) return result;\n        int wordLength = words[0].length(), maxWordLength = wordLength * words.length;\n        Map<String, Integer> wordMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (String word : words) {\n            wordMap.put(word, wordMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n        Map<String, Integer> diffMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() - maxWordLength + 1; i++) {\n            diffMap.clear();\n            diffMap.putAll(wordMap);\n            boolean haveIndex = true;\n            for (int n = 0; n < words.length; n++) {\n                String word = s.substring(i + n * wordLength, i + (n + 1) * wordLength);\n                int value = diffMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) - 1;\n                if (value >= 0) {\n                    diffMap.put(word, value);\n                } else {\n                    haveIndex = false;\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n            if (haveIndex) {\n                result.add(i);\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n## 方法二\n如果仔细观察，就会发现以上的算法存在一种浪费的情况，那就是每次读取了n个字符串出来做比较的时候，会发现是存在重复读取字符串来比较的。基于此，可以优化以上的算法。在初始化wordMap的时候，都标记为负数，作为哈希表。从左往右读取，记字符串s的长度为ls，记开始读取字符串的位置i，记words中的单个字符串长度为wordLength，words的字符串数量记为n，从i开始，读取n个长度为wordLength的字符串，那就是把i~ls的字符串划分为数个长度为wordLength的字符串，这样，最后几个不满足wordLength的字符串就可以舍弃掉了，因为无法构成一个符合要求的字符串了。\n\n设计好了滑动的窗口，然后就是开始移动，每次开始移动的时候，把wordMap中的数据写入到diffMap中初始化diffMap作为当前的哈希表，每次移动一个长度为wordLength的字符串，然后给diffMap中对应的值加1，如果出现了等于0的情况就删除该键值，如果diffMap中刚好全都被移除了，表示刚好符合要求，记录下当前的值，除此之外表示全都不满足要求。需要注意的是，外层循环的部分，只需要0~wordLength-1次，因为wordLength长度的字符串才能符合要求，所以实际上的开始位置在wordLength位置上的时候，就已经在第一轮的滑动窗口中比较过了。\n\n最终的实现代码如下，在leetcode上执行用时：11ms。\n```java\nclass Solution {\n    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {\n        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();\n        if (words.length == 0) return result;\n        int wordLength = words[0].length(), maxWordLength = wordLength * words.length;\n        Map<String, Integer> wordMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (String word : words) {\n            wordMap.put(word, wordMap.getOrDefault(word, 0) - 1);\n        }\n        Map<String, Integer> diffMap = new HashMap<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < wordLength && i + maxWordLength <= s.length(); i++) {\n            diffMap.clear();\n            diffMap.putAll(wordMap);\n            for (int j = 0; i + (j + 1) * wordLength <= s.length(); j++) {\n                int startIndex = i + j * wordLength;\n                int endIndex = i + (j + 1) * wordLength;\n                if (j >= words.length) {\n                    String firstWord = s.substring(startIndex - maxWordLength, endIndex - maxWordLength);\n                    int value = diffMap.getOrDefault(firstWord, 0) - 1;\n                    if (value == 0) {\n                        diffMap.remove(firstWord);\n                    } else {\n                        diffMap.put(firstWord, value);\n                    }\n                }\n                String nextWord = s.substring(startIndex, endIndex);\n                int value = diffMap.getOrDefault(nextWord, 0) + 1;\n                if (value != 0) {\n                    diffMap.put(nextWord, value);\n                } else {\n                    diffMap.remove(nextWord);\n                    if (diffMap.isEmpty()) {\n                        result.add(endIndex -

1; i++) {\n            for (int f = i + 1; f < points.length; f++) {\n                float dx = (float) points[i][0] - points[f][0];\n                float dy = (float) points[i][1] - points[f][1];\n                float pi = dy / dx;\n                float b = points[i][1] - pi * points[i][0];\n                Set<int[]> value = null;\n                if (dx == 0) {\n                    value = xMap.computeIfAbsent(points[i][0], k -> new HashSet<>());\n                }\n                if (value == null) {\n                    Map<Float, Set<int[]>> bMap = map.computeIfAbsent(pi, k -> new HashMap<>());\n                    value = bMap.computeIfAbsent(b, k -> new HashSet<>());\n                }\n                value.add(points[i]);\n                value.add(points[f]);\n                result = Math.max(value.size(), result);\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n# 总结\n通过以上的了例子来讲解说明，在实际中如何使用哈希表来设计高效的算法。在实际的操作做，关键字、哈希表、哈希函数，有很多种的设计方式，按照自己的需要选择合适的就可以了。其中关于关键字函数的设计有很多种，比如直接寻址法、平方取中法、折叠法、随机数法等。在实际的查找过程中，还可以和其他的算法相互结合来优化算法的效率，比如差分算法、分桶算法、二叉树、平衡树、链表、队列、前缀和等等。在数据量较大的情况下，尤其在现实的实际使用场景中，关键字冲突有可能频繁地出现，在冲突出现的时候，可以使用二叉树、红黑树、队列等等方式来保存数据，但是如果出现最差的情况，就可能出现关键字全部都一样，导致所有的数据都堆积在一起，降低查询的效率。这也是在工业上设计哈希函数的时候要注意的问题，要对极差情况，攻击者可以使用特定的方式，来让哈希表出现最差的情况，从而拖慢速度，从而发起攻击。\n\n如何设计合理的哈希函数，往往都是根据具体的情况来分析。但总的原则来说就是希望关键字尽量的唯一不会出现重复冲突，还有就是尽量地让数据保持平衡，把数据尽量的散列开来，不要让某个或者某些关键字出现大量的数据堆积，从而拖慢速度。在实际应用中，哈希表往往是动态扩容的，当装填因子渐渐变大的时候，如何进行动态扩容也是会在实际运用中可能需要面对的问题。一般地可以在装填因子达到某个阈值之后，就去申请一个新的更大的哈希表来保存数据，然后把数据迁移过去。当然也可以在装填因子变得太小的时候，缩小哈希表，从而节省空间，但是否需要这么做，要根据具体的信息来决定，比如这种装填因子是否只是短期内的波动，如果频繁地更新哈希表，也会导致效率下降，比如波峰可能只有一段时间内，超过一段时间之后，就恢复成可接受的装填因子了。这些信息都可能会决定是否需要动态缩表或者动态扩表。如果一次性的完成动态缩表或者扩表，就可能对当前正在进行的操作造成效率降低的问题。可以先申请新的哈希表，把新的数据写入到新的哈希表中，然后分批把旧的数据写入到新的哈希表来完成缩表或者扩表，对于这个时候的查询和删除来说，就需要先去在新的哈希表操作，然后再去旧的哈希表操作，这样既可以降低动态改变哈希表的影响，也可以完成动态改变哈希表。所以操作的复杂度、时间复杂度、空间复杂度，就需要做出权衡，如果可以全部顾及那自然是最好的，否则就需要选择一个对自己最好的选择。\n\n本文中只是讲了比较简单一些的例子，在实际运用中，会比上面的例子管理的数据庞大得多，但是基本的哈希思想是不变的，就是创建一个哈希表，然后来建立快速的查找关系，尤其在大量的数据面前，是可以收获到很好的效果的。比如安全加密、数据校验、LRU缓存淘汰算法、word中的拼写检查等等，这些都会用到哈希思想。还有在大型系统中的负载均衡，如何快速地管理系统中的服务器并找到对应的IP地址，就可以建立一个哈希表来增删改查从而达到负载均衡的目的。还有比如数据分片，管理大型日志库，如何查找日志库中查询频率最高的关键字，如何判断图片是否在图库之中等等。还有分布式的存储、布谷鸟哈希表等等，这里不多做赘述，这些的应用都会很常见。合理使用哈希思想确实可以帮助我们有效地提高算法效率。\n\n# 参考文献\n\n[1] Thomas H.Cormen, Charles E.Leiserson, Ronald L.Rivest, Clifford Stein：算法导论[M].殷建平，徐云，王刚，刘晓光，苏明，邹恒明，王宏志.\n机械工业出版社，2012-12\n\n[^1]: https://leetcode.cn/problems/remove-letter-to-equalize-frequency\n[^2]: https://leetcode.cn/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words\n[^3]: https://leetcode.cn/problems/max-points-on-a-line/","slug":"哈希思想在算法中的实践","published":1,"updated":"2024-12-10T07:57:16.195Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vksk004ipmnk2j7x1lg6","content":"<p>【Abstract】In order to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, the\nhash idea is a very useful method in the practice of the algorithm.

id=\"more\"></span></p>\n<h1 id=\"一引言\">一、引言</h1>\n<p>在日常进行代码编程和实际的工作中，经常会遇到需要设计一些算法的场景，哈希表作为数据结构中常见的一种形式，有很大的用处，合理使用哈希表可以有效的帮助到我们来设计更有效率的算法。一般地，在很多算法设计的时候，都会遇到动态集合的需求，需要支持插入、查找、删除的操作，使用哈希表来构建，会是一种非常有效的思路。哈希思想就是使用哈希表的手段，来解决一些实际的问题，即本文主要通过一些实践例子来试图讲解哈希思想的运用。</p>\n<h1 id=\"二什么是哈希思想\">二、什么是哈希思想</h1>\n<p>哈希表也叫散列表，由三部分组成，一部分是关键字，也叫直接寻址表，一部分是数组，也叫哈希表或者散列表，一部分是哈希函数，也叫散列函数，可以通过关键字通过散列函数在数组中查找数据，这样理想的情况就是查找时间O(1)，最差的情况会出现整个列表全都查找一遍，时间是O(n)。但是这种最差的情况一般不会出现，因为哈希表的关键字在构建的时候一般尽量选择具有唯一性的值，比如使用哈希散列算法计算出来的哈希值。哈希思想简单总结来说，就是构建一个关键字函数，然后通过哈希函数来与数组部分相关联就可以查找数据了。</p>\n<p>当关键字数量比较小的时候，可以使用直接寻址法，把全部的关键字都构建出来，然后建立查找关系就可以了。当关键字比较多的时候，可以使用开放寻址法，按照需要，动态构建相关的关键字集合，然后再建立增删改查的关系就可以了。构建完全哈希表，静态存储全部关键字，可以在完全哈希表中最坏情况下完成关键字查找，这种在有些情况下也是合适的做法，具体采用何种做法，视具体情况而定。</p>\n<p>当关键字无法保证覆盖全部的数据时，就会出现关键字冲突，导致一个关键字对应多个数据，采用的方法很多，比如对于冲突的数据采用链表的方式，或者红黑树来建立查找关系，通过一一查找来寻找数据，这种方法好处是基本可以覆盖所有的数据，坏处是，在冲突的关键字上会存在数据堆积现象，可能需要把冲突的数据全部查找一遍才可以，而且还需要另外开辟一个空间来存储数据，增加空间消耗。当然还有别的办法，比如开放寻址法，当关键字冲突的时候，使用在散列法，使用该关键字再生成一个新的关键字，如果还冲突就重复再用新生成的这个关键字生成一个关键字，直到不重复为止，这种方法的优点是，保证可以放下全部的数据，节省空间，这种方法的缺点是不能真正地删除数据，因为后面新生成的关键字是可能和之前删除的关键字相关的，只能标记一下已经删除了。在开放寻址法中重新生成冲突的关键字的方法，还有链表法，还有比如线性探查法，直接依次探查下一个关键字就可以了，还有比如二次探查、双重散列、建立公共溢出区等等方法。</p>\n<p>随着哈希表数据的增加，可以使用装填因子也叫装载因子来表示当前数据的填满程度，装填因子的计算方法是装入哈希表中的关键字个数与当前哈希表总的长度的比值，当装填因子越大的时候，填充的数据越多，空间利用率越高，但是关键字冲突的可能性就会增加，查找数据的成本可能就会增加。当装填因子越小的时候，填充的数据越少，空间利用率就越低，关键字冲突的概率就会减少，查找数据的成本越低。往往在设置装填因子的时候，就需要根据实际情况做一些取舍和平衡来冲突的概率和空间利用率，然后根据装填因子来决定是否增加哈希表的长度还是什么别的处理。</p>\n<p>文本的代码实现都是使用Java实现。</p>\n<h1 id=\"三删除字符使频率相同\">三、删除字符使频率相同</h1>\n<p>题目描述： &gt;\n给你一个下标从0开始的字符串word，字符串只包含小写英文字母。你需要选择一个下标并删除下标处的字符，使得word中剩余每个字母出现频率相同。如果删除一个字母后，并且恰好只删除一个字母，word中剩余所有字母的出现频率都相同，那么返回true，否则返回false。比如输入的字符串是<code>aaccc</code>，'c'的数量是3，数量减1，就可以让'a'和'c'的数量一样，所以返回tue。<a\nhref=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref1\"\nrole=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n<p>首先分析下该问题，首先我们需要遍历一遍字符串，首先统计出所有字母的出现频率。英文字母有26，且不考虑大小写，只有小写字母，那么我们就可以构建一个哈希表来记录字母的出现频率，表的长度最大值也就是26了，因为关键字数量很小，所以可以首先初始化出一个26长度的数组，也就是哈希表，然后再去遍历整个字符串，按照26个字母的顺序，来记录频率数据，所以其实这就相当于建立一个字母和频率一一对应关系的字典，这样就可以节约内存空间来避免保存所有的字母，因为数组可以按照字母顺序直接去读取，所以还可以节省插入时的时间消耗。</p>\n<p>然后就可以来处理上一步得到的数组了。首先如果得到的所有字母的最大数量就是1，也就是说字符串里所有的字母都不相同，那么可以直接返回为true，因为任何一个数量减1之后都可以符合条件。然后遍历一遍这个数组，可以得到数量的最大值（下方代码中的max，代表出现数量最多的次数是多少）和最小值（下方代码中的min，代表出现数量最少的次数是多少），还可以得到最大数量出现的次数（下方代码中的countMax，代表有多少种字母是这个最大数量max的），和最小数量出现的次数（下方代码中的countMin，代表有多少种字母是这个最小数量min的）。如果判断最大数量出现的次数等于全部的字符长度，那就代表该字符串全部的字母都相同，除非该字符串word的长度小于等于2可以返回为true，否则是返回false。如果最大数量只出现了一次，也就是只有一种字母数量最多，那么最大的数量减去最小的数量，差值为1或者0，比如abcc、abb、cdd、ab、ef这样的字符串，这些都是可以返回为true的，如果是abccc、abbccc、abbb这样的字符串就该返回false。如果最大数量只出现了一次，也就是只有一种字母数量最多，并且其他的字母都是1个，比如accccc、bffff这样的字符串，这些都是返回的true，除此之外的其他的情况都是false。如果最大数量出现了多个，但是最小数量的只出现了一个，并且这两种加起来的数量刚好等于字符串的长度，就代表，比如abbbccc、effgg这样的字符串，这些都应该返回true，除此之外的其他情况都是false，比如abbcccfff这样的字符串就该是false。</p>\n<p>实现的代码如下：

方法二\n如果仔细观察，就会发现以上的算法存在一种浪费的情况，那就是每次读取了n个字符串出来做比较的时候，会发现是存在重复读取字符串来比较的。基于此，可以优化以上的算法。在初始化wordMap的时候，都标记为负数，作为哈希表。从左往右读取，记字符串s的长度为ls，记开始读取字符串的位置i，记words中的单个字符串长度为wordLength，words的字符串数量记为n，从i开始，读取n个长度为wordLength的字符串，那就是把i~ls的字符串划分为数个长度为wordLength的字符串，这样，最后几个不满足wordLength的字符串就可以舍弃掉了，因为无法构成一个符合要求的字符串了。</p>\n<p>设计好了滑动的窗口，然后就是开始移动，每次开始移动的时候，把wordMap中的数据写入到diffMap中初始化diffMap作为当前的哈希表，每次移动一个长度为wordLength的字符串，然后给diffMap中对应的值加1，如果出现了等于0的情况就删除该键值，如果diffMap中刚好全都被移除了，表示刚好符合要求，记录下当前的值，除此之外表示全都不满足要求。需要注意的是，外层循环的部分，只需要0~wordLength-1次，因为wordLength长度的字符串才能符合要求，所以实际上的开始位置在wordLength位置上的时候，就已经在第一轮的滑动窗口中比较过了。</p>\n<p>最终的实现代码如下，在leetcode上执行用时：11ms。

id=\"总结\">总结</h1>\n<p>通过以上的了例子来讲解说明，在实际中如何使用哈希表来设计高效的算法。在实际的操作做，关键字、哈希表、哈希函数，有很多种的设计方式，按照自己的需要选择合适的就可以了。其中关于关键字函数的设计有很多种，比如直接寻址法、平方取中法、折叠法、随机数法等。在实际的查找过程中，还可以和其他的算法相互结合来优化算法的效率，比如差分算法、分桶算法、二叉树、平衡树、链表、队列、前缀和等等。在数据量较大的情况下，尤其在现实的实际使用场景中，关键字冲突有可能频繁地出现，在冲突出现的时候，可以使用二叉树、红黑树、队列等等方式来保存数据，但是如果出现最差的情况，就可能出现关键字全部都一样，导致所有的数据都堆积在一起，降低查询的效率。这也是在工业上设计哈希函数的时候要注意的问题，要对极差情况，攻击者可以使用特定的方式，来让哈希表出现最差的情况，从而拖慢速度，从而发起攻击。</p>\n<p>如何设计合理的哈希函数，往往都是根据具体的情况来分析。但总的原则来说就是希望关键字尽量的唯一不会出现重复冲突，还有就是尽量地让数据保持平衡，把数据尽量的散列开来，不要让某个或者某些关键字出现大量的数据堆积，从而拖慢速度。在实际应用中，哈希表往往是动态扩容的，当装填因子渐渐变大的时候，如何进行动态扩容也是会在实际运用中可能需要面对的问题。一般地可以在装填因子达到某个阈值之后，就去申请一个新的更大的哈希表来保存数据，然后把数据迁移过去。当然也可以在装填因子变得太小的时候，缩小哈希表，从而节省空间，但是否需要这么做，要根据具体的信息来决定，比如这种装填因子是否只是短期内的波动，如果频繁地更新哈希表，也会导致效率下降，比如波峰可能只有一段时间内，超过一段时间之后，就恢复成可接受的装填因子了。这些信息都可能会决定是否需要动态缩表或者动态扩表。如果一次性的完成动态缩表或者扩表，就可能对当前正在进行的操作造成效率降低的问题。可以先申请新的哈希表，把新的数据写入到新的哈希表中，然后分批把旧的数据写入到新的哈希表来完成缩表或者扩表，对于这个时候的查询和删除来说，就需要先去在新的哈希表操作，然后再去旧的哈希表操作，这样既可以降低动态改变哈希表的影响，也可以完成动态改变哈希表。所以操作的复杂度、时间复杂度、空间复杂度，就需要做出权衡，如果可以全部顾及那自然是最好的，否则就需要选择一个对自己最好的选择。</p>\n<p>本文中只是讲了比较简单一些的例子，在实际运用中，会比上面的例子管理的数据庞大得多，但是基本的哈希思想是不变的，就是创建一个哈希表，然后来建立快速的查找关系，尤其在大量的数据面前，是可以收获到很好的效果的。比如安全加密、数据校验、LRU缓存淘汰算法、word中的拼写检查等等，这些都会用到哈希思想。还有在大型系统中的负载均衡，如何快速地管理系统中的服务器并找到对应的IP地址，就可以建立一个哈希表来增删改查从而达到负载均衡的目的。还有比如数据分片，管理大型日志库，如何查找日志库中查询频率最高的关键字，如何判断图片是否在图库之中等等。还有分布式的存储、布谷鸟哈希表等等，这里不多做赘述，这些的应用都会很常见。合理使用哈希思想确实可以帮助我们有效地提高算法效率。</p>\n<h1

id=\"二什么是哈希思想\">二、什么是哈希思想</h1>\n<p>哈希表也叫散列表，由三部分组成，一部分是关键字，也叫直接寻址表，一部分是数组，也叫哈希表或者散列表，一部分是哈希函数，也叫散列函数，可以通过关键字通过散列函数在数组中查找数据，这样理想的情况就是查找时间O(1)，最差的情况会出现整个列表全都查找一遍，时间是O(n)。但是这种最差的情况一般不会出现，因为哈希表的关键字在构建的时候一般尽量选择具有唯一性的值，比如使用哈希散列算法计算出来的哈希值。哈希思想简单总结来说，就是构建一个关键字函数，然后通过哈希函数来与数组部分相关联就可以查找数据了。</p>\n<p>当关键字数量比较小的时候，可以使用直接寻址法，把全部的关键字都构建出来，然后建立查找关系就可以了。当关键字比较多的时候，可以使用开放寻址法，按照需要，动态构建相关的关键字集合，然后再建立增删改查的关系就可以了。构建完全哈希表，静态存储全部关键字，可以在完全哈希表中最坏情况下完成关键字查找，这种在有些情况下也是合适的做法，具体采用何种做法，视具体情况而定。</p>\n<p>当关键字无法保证覆盖全部的数据时，就会出现关键字冲突，导致一个关键字对应多个数据，采用的方法很多，比如对于冲突的数据采用链表的方式，或者红黑树来建立查找关系，通过一一查找来寻找数据，这种方法好处是基本可以覆盖所有的数据，坏处是，在冲突的关键字上会存在数据堆积现象，可能需要把冲突的数据全部查找一遍才可以，而且还需要另外开辟一个空间来存储数据，增加空间消耗。当然还有别的办法，比如开放寻址法，当关键字冲突的时候，使用在散列法，使用该关键字再生成一个新的关键字，如果还冲突就重复再用新生成的这个关键字生成一个关键字，直到不重复为止，这种方法的优点是，保证可以放下全部的数据，节省空间，这种方法的缺点是不能真正地删除数据，因为后面新生成的关键字是可能和之前删除的关键字相关的，只能标记一下已经删除了。在开放寻址法中重新生成冲突的关键字的方法，还有链表法，还有比如线性探查法，直接依次探查下一个关键字就可以了，还有比如二次探查、双重散列、建立公共溢出区等等方法。</p>\n<p>随着哈希表数据的增加，可以使用装填因子也叫装载因子来表示当前数据的填满程度，装填因子的计算方法是装入哈希表中的关键字个数与当前哈希表总的长度的比值，当装填因子越大的时候，填充的数据越多，空间利用率越高，但是关键字冲突的可能性就会增加，查找数据的成本可能就会增加。当装填因子越小的时候，填充的数据越少，空间利用率就越低，关键字冲突的概率就会减少，查找数据的成本越低。往往在设置装填因子的时候，就需要根据实际情况做一些取舍和平衡来冲突的概率和空间利用率，然后根据装填因子来决定是否增加哈希表的长度还是什么别的处理。</p>\n<p>文本的代码实现都是使用Java实现。</p>\n<h1 id=\"三删除字符使频率相同\">三、删除字符使频率相同</h1>\n<p>题目描述： &gt;\n给你一个下标从0开始的字符串word，字符串只包含小写英文字母。你需要选择一个下标并删除下标处的字符，使得word中剩余每个字母出现频率相同。如果删除一个字母后，并且恰好只删除一个字母，word中剩余所有字母的出现频率都相同，那么返回true，否则返回false。比如输入的字符串是<code>aaccc</code>，'c'的数量是3，数量减1，就可以让'a'和'c'的数量一样，所以返回tue。<a\nhref=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref1\"\nrole=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n<p>首先分析下该问题，首先我们需要遍历一遍字符串，首先统计出所有字母的出现频率。英文字母有26，且不考虑大小写，只有小写字母，那么我们就可以构建一个哈希表来记录字母的出现频率，表的长度最大值也就是26了，因为关键字数量很小，所以可以首先初始化出一个26长度的数组，也就是哈希表，然后再去遍历整个字符串，按照26个字母的顺序，来记录频率数据，所以其实这就相当于建立一个字母和频率一一对应关系的字典，这样就可以节约内存空间来避免保存所有的字母，因为数组可以按照字母顺序直接去读取，所以还可以节省插入时的时间消耗。</p>\n<p>然后就可以来处理上一步得到的数组了。首先如果得到的所有字母的最大数量就是1，也就是说字符串里所有的字母都不相同，那么可以直接返回为true，因为任何一个数量减1之后都可以符合条件。然后遍历一遍这个数组，可以得到数量的最大值（下方代码中的max，代表出现数量最多的次数是多少）和最小值（下方代码中的min，代表出现数量最少的次数是多少），还可以得到最大数量出现的次数（下方代码中的countMax，代表有多少种字母是这个最大数量max的），和最小数量出现的次数（下方代码中的countMin，代表有多少种字母是这个最小数量min的）。如果判断最大数量出现的次数等于全部的字符长度，那就代表该字符串全部的字母都相同，除非该字符串word的长度小于等于2可以返回为true，否则是返回false。如果最大数量只出现了一次，也就是只有一种字母数量最多，那么最大的数量减去最小的数量，差值为1或者0，比如abcc、abb、cdd、ab、ef这样的字符串，这些都是可以返回为true的，如果是abccc、abbccc、abbb这样的字符串就该返回false。如果最大数量只出现了一次，也就是只有一种字母数量最多，并且其他的字母都是1个，比如accccc、bffff这样的字符串，这些都是返回的true，除此之外的其他的情况都是false。如果最大数量出现了多个，但是最小数量的只出现了一个，并且这两种加起来的数量刚好等于字符串的长度，就代表，比如abbbccc、effgg这样的字符串，这些都应该返回true，除此之外的其他情况都是false，比如abbcccfff这样的字符串就该是false。</p>\n<p>实现的代码如下：

方法二\n如果仔细观察，就会发现以上的算法存在一种浪费的情况，那就是每次读取了n个字符串出来做比较的时候，会发现是存在重复读取字符串来比较的。基于此，可以优化以上的算法。在初始化wordMap的时候，都标记为负数，作为哈希表。从左往右读取，记字符串s的长度为ls，记开始读取字符串的位置i，记words中的单个字符串长度为wordLength，words的字符串数量记为n，从i开始，读取n个长度为wordLength的字符串，那就是把i~ls的字符串划分为数个长度为wordLength的字符串，这样，最后几个不满足wordLength的字符串就可以舍弃掉了，因为无法构成一个符合要求的字符串了。</p>\n<p>设计好了滑动的窗口，然后就是开始移动，每次开始移动的时候，把wordMap中的数据写入到diffMap中初始化diffMap作为当前的哈希表，每次移动一个长度为wordLength的字符串，然后给diffMap中对应的值加1，如果出现了等于0的情况就删除该键值，如果diffMap中刚好全都被移除了，表示刚好符合要求，记录下当前的值，除此之外表示全都不满足要求。需要注意的是，外层循环的部分，只需要0~wordLength-1次，因为wordLength长度的字符串才能符合要求，所以实际上的开始位置在wordLength位置上的时候，就已经在第一轮的滑动窗口中比较过了。</p>\n<p>最终的实现代码如下，在leetcode上执行用时：11ms。

id=\"五直线上最多的点数\">五、直线上最多的点数</h1>\n<p>题目描述： &gt;给你一个数组points，其中 points[i] = [xi, yi] 表示 X-Y\n平面上的一个点。求最多有多少个点在同一条直线上。<a href=\"#fn3\"\nclass=\"footnote-ref\" id=\"fnref3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><sup>3</sup></a></p>\n<p>看到这样的描述，可以显而易见的发现，这是一个二维平面坐标，也就是可以使用二元一次函数来表示是，也就是<strong>y=ax+b</strong>形式的函数，其中的特例是<strong>x=c</strong>(c表示一个常数)，二元一次方程都可以用上面的函数来表示，用这样的函数形式就可以表示X-Y平面上所有的直线了。这样的话就可以用两个点来表示一条直线了，然后只需要判断剩下的点是否在当前这条直线上就可以了。那我们借此来构建哈希函数，然后按照分桶算法来给点分组，然后计数，然后输出其中最大的值即可。</p>\n<p>分桶算法就是很直观的一种哈希思想实现，按照关键词，把数据分成多组，然后对数组进行处理，每个桶分别维护自己内部的数据，然后管理每个桶就可以了。在本问题中因为两点成一条直线，所以可以用[xi,\nyi]和[xi+1,\nyi+1]两两相减，然后就可以按照<strong>y=ax+b</strong>来计算出a和b，或者当x坐标都一样的时候就可以按照<strong>x=c</strong>来计算出c，对于<strong>y=ax+b</strong>的形式，首先按照a分成一组，然后在这一组数据中再按照b再进行一次划分，细划分出新的桶来，另外对于<strong>x=c</strong>的形式，把c作为关键字划分出数据来当做一个桶。以a、b、c作为哈希表的关键字分别计算，这样的话就可以把数据分到一个个的桶中，然后再去计数有多少点是一条直接上的就可以了。</p>\n<p>以下是代码实现，在leetcode上执行用时:

id=\"总结\">总结</h1>\n<p>通过以上的了例子来讲解说明，在实际中如何使用哈希表来设计高效的算法。在实际的操作做，关键字、哈希表、哈希函数，有很多种的设计方式，按照自己的需要选择合适的就可以了。其中关于关键字函数的设计有很多种，比如直接寻址法、平方取中法、折叠法、随机数法等。在实际的查找过程中，还可以和其他的算法相互结合来优化算法的效率，比如差分算法、分桶算法、二叉树、平衡树、链表、队列、前缀和等等。在数据量较大的情况下，尤其在现实的实际使用场景中，关键字冲突有可能频繁地出现，在冲突出现的时候，可以使用二叉树、红黑树、队列等等方式来保存数据，但是如果出现最差的情况，就可能出现关键字全部都一样，导致所有的数据都堆积在一起，降低查询的效率。这也是在工业上设计哈希函数的时候要注意的问题，要对极差情况，攻击者可以使用特定的方式，来让哈希表出现最差的情况，从而拖慢速度，从而发起攻击。</p>\n<p>如何设计合理的哈希函数，往往都是根据具体的情况来分析。但总的原则来说就是希望关键字尽量的唯一不会出现重复冲突，还有就是尽量地让数据保持平衡，把数据尽量的散列开来，不要让某个或者某些关键字出现大量的数据堆积，从而拖慢速度。在实际应用中，哈希表往往是动态扩容的，当装填因子渐渐变大的时候，如何进行动态扩容也是会在实际运用中可能需要面对的问题。一般地可以在装填因子达到某个阈值之后，就去申请一个新的更大的哈希表来保存数据，然后把数据迁移过去。当然也可以在装填因子变得太小的时候，缩小哈希表，从而节省空间，但是否需要这么做，要根据具体的信息来决定，比如这种装填因子是否只是短期内的波动，如果频繁地更新哈希表，也会导致效率下降，比如波峰可能只有一段时间内，超过一段时间之后，就恢复成可接受的装填因子了。这些信息都可能会决定是否需要动态缩表或者动态扩表。如果一次性的完成动态缩表或者扩表，就可能对当前正在进行的操作造成效率降低的问题。可以先申请新的哈希表，把新的数据写入到新的哈希表中，然后分批把旧的数据写入到新的哈希表来完成缩表或者扩表，对于这个时候的查询和删除来说，就需要先去在新的哈希表操作，然后再去旧的哈希表操作，这样既可以降低动态改变哈希表的影响，也可以完成动态改变哈希表。所以操作的复杂度、时间复杂度、空间复杂度，就需要做出权衡，如果可以全部顾及那自然是最好的，否则就需要选择一个对自己最好的选择。</p>\n<p>本文中只是讲了比较简单一些的例子，在实际运用中，会比上面的例子管理的数据庞大得多，但是基本的哈希思想是不变的，就是创建一个哈希表，然后来建立快速的查找关系，尤其在大量的数据面前，是可以收获到很好的效果的。比如安全加密、数据校验、LRU缓存淘汰算法、word中的拼写检查等等，这些都会用到哈希思想。还有在大型系统中的负载均衡，如何快速地管理系统中的服务器并找到对应的IP地址，就可以建立一个哈希表来增删改查从而达到负载均衡的目的。还有比如数据分片，管理大型日志库，如何查找日志库中查询频率最高的关键字，如何判断图片是否在图库之中等等。还有分布式的存储、布谷鸟哈希表等等，这里不多做赘述，这些的应用都会很常见。合理使用哈希思想确实可以帮助我们有效地提高算法效率。</p>\n<h1

``和``uses-permission``都是必须的：\n```xml\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n    package=\"com.android.demo\"\n

android.content.ComponentName\nimport android.content.Context\nimport android.content.Intent\n\nobject PageConstants {\n    const val pageReceiver = \"com.android.demo.broadcast.PageReceiver\"\n    const val pagePackage = \"com.android.demo\"\n    const val pageReceiverPermission = \"com.android.demo.broadcast.PageReceiver.permission\"\n\n    //我这里需要跳转的页面不多，所以在采用特定值的方式\n    const val gotoVipPage

  context.sendBroadcast(intent, PageConstants.pageReceiverPermission)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n``PageReceiver``中的实现\n```Kotlin\nimport android.content.BroadcastReceiver\nimport android.content.Context\nimport android.content.Intent\nimport cc.fotoplace.PageConstants\n\nclass PageReceiver : BroadcastReceiver() {\n    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {\n        when {\n            //在这里处理参数\n            intent.hasExtra(PageConstants.gotoVipPage) -> {\n                val intentActivity = Intent(context, VipInfoActivity::class.java)\n                intentActivity.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)\n                context.startActivity(intentActivity)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n# 通过反射类名来跳转\n通过反射可以直接去跳转页面，或者处理你要处理的方法\n```Kotlin\nimport android.content.Context\nimport android.content.Intent\nimport android.util.Log\n\nobject PageConstants {\n    @JvmStatic\n    fun gotoVipPage(context: Context) {\n        try {\n            val intentActivity =\n                Intent(context, Class.forName(\"com.android.demo.VipInfoActivity\"))\n            intentActivity.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)\n            if (intentActivity.resolveActivity(context.packageManager) != null) {\n                context.startActivity(intentActivity)\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"xx\", \"无法处理该跳转\")\n            }\n        } catch (e: ClassNotFoundException) {\n            e.printStackTrace()\n            Log.i(\"xx\", \"找不到该页面\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n以上方法，对于结果的回调，需要自己处理onActivityResult的方法来处理。\n\n在这里提及一点儿需要注意的地方，对于文件、图片什么的，可以通过``ContentResolver``来处理传送的路径，并不需要直接发送文件。\n```Kotlin\n    // Add the image to media store.\n    fun addImage(\n        resolver: ContentResolver, title: String,\n        date: Long, orientation: Int,\n        path: String?\n    ): Uri? {\n        // Insert into MediaStore.\n        val values =

values.put(MediaStore.Images.ImageColumns.DATE_TAKEN, date)\n        values.put(MediaStore.Images.ImageColumns.MIME_TYPE, \"image/jpeg\")\n        values.put(MediaStore.Images.ImageColumns.ORIENTATION, orientation)\n        values.put(MediaStore.Images.ImageColumns.DATA, path)\n        var uri: Uri? = null\n        try {\n            uri = resolver.insert(\n                MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI,\n                values\n            )\n        } catch (th: Throwable) {\n\n        }\n        return uri\n    }\n```\n# [Deep link](https://developer.android.google.cn/training/app-links/deep-linking)\n在``AndroidManifest``中注册一个DeepLinkActivity\n```xml\n<manifest

 intentActivity.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)\n                context.startActivity(intentActivity)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n# 通过反射类名来跳转\n通过反射可以直接去跳转页面，或者处理你要处理的方法\n```Kotlin\nimport android.content.Context\nimport android.content.Intent\nimport android.util.Log\n\nobject PageConstants {\n    @JvmStatic\n    fun gotoVipPage(context: Context) {\n        try {\n            val intentActivity =\n                Intent(context, Class.forName(\"com.android.demo.VipInfoActivity\"))\n            intentActivity.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK)\n            if (intentActivity.resolveActivity(context.packageManager) != null) {\n                context.startActivity(intentActivity)\n            } else {\n                Log.i(\"xx\", \"无法处理该跳转\")\n            }\n        } catch (e: ClassNotFoundException) {\n            e.printStackTrace()\n            Log.i(\"xx\", \"找不到该页面\")\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n以上方法，对于结果的回调，需要自己处理onActivityResult的方法来处理。\n\n在这里提及一点儿需要注意的地方，对于文件、图片什么的，可以通过``ContentResolver``来处理传送的路径，并不需要直接发送文件。\n```Kotlin\n    // Add the image to media store.\n    fun addImage(\n        resolver: ContentResolver, title: String,\n        date: Long, orientation: Int,\n        path: String?\n    ): Uri? {\n        // Insert into MediaStore.\n        val values =

}\n```\n# [Deep link](https://developer.android.google.cn/training/app-links/deep-linking)\n在``AndroidManifest``中注册一个DeepLinkActivity\n```xml\n<manifest

如果从学术上给社会分层下定义的话，可以理解为:社会分层是指社会成员、社会群体因社会资源占有不同而产生的层化或差异现象，尤其是指建立在法律、法规基础上的制度化的社会差异体系。\n<!--more-->\n2. 我们考察有文字记载以来的人类历史，还没有发现哪一个社会能够将人们的地位完全拉平；就是没有文字记载的社会，据称所谓“母系社会”“父系社会”，至少性别造成的地位差异也是显而易见的。\n\n3. 改革开放之前，是以“先赋因素”来确认人身份的身份制，比如户籍、家庭出身，严重限制了社会流动性。\n\n4. 社会结构是指社会各要素和各部分相互之间的一种比较稳定的关系模式或互动模式。\n\n5. 一般认为，从社会学家韦伯开始提出了三元社会分层的观点：即财产地位分层、权利地位分层和声望地位分层。其实，有多少种社会资源，就可以有多少种不同的社会分层或社会分层结构。\n\n6. 消除差异的公平观和地位准入的公平观。\n\n7. 我国社会分层现象的特点：\n>* 社会分层差异巨大\n>* 城乡分野\n>* 金字塔型社会结构\n>* 身份等级社会\n>* 官民社会\n>* 精英层的巨大作用\n>* 社会基础群体的重大社会功能\n>* 社会流动机制的特点\n>* 家庭纽带弥合社会差异的重要功能\n\n8. 伦斯基认为，社会结构、社会分层的核心问题是两个：第一，谁得到了什么？第二，为什么得到？\n\n9. 中国近70年资源配置的手段，政府干预、市场机制、权利的作用、单位的作用、老百姓的博弈。\n\n10. 乌坎事件。\n\n11. 起到缓解社会矛盾的机制：第一，基层组织的“缓冲机制。第二，传统单位体制的“缓冲机制”功能。第三，政治身份群体“缓冲机制”。第四，新的社会保障机制起到了缓冲社会矛盾的功能。第五，子女地位上升对父母地位下降的补偿功能。第六，家庭内部的经济互助，这是最具有中国特色的社会缓冲机制。\n\n12. 欧美发达国家社会分层演化的特点：第一，从传统的贵族与平民的身份制度演变为雇主与雇员的阶级分层制度。第二，农业劳动阶级的衰落和工业劳动阶级的兴起。第三，职业分层成为社会分层的基础。第四，白领阶层在人数和比例上均超过蓝领阶层。第五，庞大的中产阶级队伍的形成。第六，生产力的高度发展。第七，严格税收制度缓解了贫富分化。第八，社会保障制度使社会上绝大多数人都能享受到基本的福利。\n\n13. 帕金(Frank Parkin)，社会屏蔽理论。\n\n14. 有必要阐释一下什么是“身份”。在社会学上，马克斯·韦伯最早也最为系统地阐述了身份（ status）和身份群体（ status group）的概念。**韦伯认为:“身份”指的是在社会声望方面可以有效地得到的肯定或否定的特权**，它建立在如下一种或数种因素基础之上:a生活方式；b正式的教育过程，包括实际经验的训练或理性的训练，及与此相对应的生活方式；c.因出身或因职业而获得的声望。”①韦伯认为，身份与阶级不同，**阶级是由客观经济指标决定的分层体系，而身份是由主观社会评价决定的**。韦伯身份概念的复杂性在于，一方面强调了身份是主观社会评价上的地位，另一方面又强调身份有客观生活方式、教育、职业、出身作为基础。身份制就是建立在上述身份基础上的一套由法律、法规、规范认可的制度体系。\n\n15. 白领阶层和中间阶层形成的基本条件。第一，要有产业变迁的条件，即它一般形成于第二产业向第三产业转型的过程之中。第二，这实际上是一个职业变迁的问题。第三，和教育有关系。\n\n16. 改革开放以来中国社会分层结构的变迁。一，身份制的变迁。二，单位制的变迁。三，经济分层取代政治分层。四，社会中心群体与社会边缘群体关系的变化。五，新的社会阶层形成。\n\n17. “利益碎片化”的一个重要表现是，人们从过去的那种仅仅追求整体利益，转变为今天的追求个体利益。每个人都追求个体利益，这样，追求利益的方向就非常不一致，这样就形成不了整体的社会运动。社会就不会产生整体的冲突。\n\n18. ①［法］列斐伏尔（HemiTebwe）:《空间:社会产物与使用价值》夏铸九等编译，收录《空间的文化形式与社会理论读本》，台北明文书局，2002年版，第20-21页。\n\n19. “社区碎片化”引发的后果。\n>* 第一，社区之间的分化或“碎片化”，造成了社会关系的失衡。\n>* 第二，社区内部的“碎片化”，斩断了人们的交往，社区失去了共同体的意义。\n>* 第三，利益的“碎片化”加剧了社会矛盾与冲突。第四，权利的“碎片化”造成了管理的真空。\n\n20. 笔者以为，所谓利益群体，核心问题说的是“在物质利益上，地位相近的人所构成的群体”或者说在经济利益上，地位相近的人所构成的群体”。\n\n21. 知识分子是市场发展第一阶段政治地位上升最快的群体，从政治地位很低的群体上升为政治地位较高的群体。90年代以来，随着市场发展进入第二个阶段、知识分子又成为市场改革的经济上的获益者在这一阶段，与其他群体相比较，知识分子又成为经济地位相对上升较快的群体。所以，知识分子在市场转型的两个阶段都是获益者。在第一个阶段，知识分子获得了政治利益，在第二个阶段，知识分子获得了经济利益。因此，我们可以判断，知识分子是中国经济社会现代化改革中最为典型的获益群体。由此可以判断，知识分子会成为我国现代化改革的最主要的支持者。\n\n22. 当然，对于社会保障、社会福利制度与底层群体的关系，学界一直是有争论的。赞同推进福利保障制度的一派认为，社会福利、社会保障制度是现代社会不可缺少的制度环节，这样的制度对跌入底层的人群起到了救助作用，减轻了底层的贫困程度，使得他们不至于产生生存危机，最终有利于全社会的和谐。而批评福利保障制度的一派认为，奉行了多年福利保障制度的所谓发达国家也并未能消灭贫困现象，有时候，贫困甚至有所加剧，这是因为，福利保障制度只是貌似公允，实际上，它反而是造成贫困层之原因。这又可以分为激进主义者与保守主义者。**激进主义者**认为:“表面看来福利制度是济贫，其实，政府发放的福利、救济金数额较少，只能使穷人维持在贫困的生活水平上。这样，救济金实际上在制造着一个贫困阶层。这个阶层生活困苦，却由于保障制度而尚能存活。因此，福利制度阻止了穷人贫困状况的根本改善。”而**保守主义者**则认为:“福利制度之所以造成了贫困，不在于它阻止了社会制度的根本变革，而是因为社会福利、保障与救济的开支过大，它使社会再生产受到抑制，使投资减少，结果限制了财富与新的就业机会的增长，最终加剧了社会上一部分人的贫困化。”\n\n23. 最早提出“相对剥夺”范式的是美国社会学斯托夫（S. Stouffer他认为，“相对剥夺感”是社会不满和社会动荡的重要源泉。**“相对剥夺感”**是一种很矛盾的心理状态。此种心态的产生是由于，人们将自己的命运与那些既和自己的地位相近，又不完全等同于自己的人或群体做反向的比较。此种心态变得强烈是由于，人们所对比的群体变成了自己的潜在对手。社会学家默顿（R. Merton）则用“参照群体”（ reference group）的理论来解释“相对剥夺感”，**即关键是人们将哪一个群体视为自己的参照群体、同哪一个群体比较**。\n\n24. 贫困文化理论，刘易斯\n\n25. 中国社会的四个利益群体，即特殊获益群体，普通获益群体，利益相对受损群体和社会底层群体。\n\n26. 而笔者所说的“社会结构紧张是指社会结构的不协调，使得社会群体之间的关系处在一种对立的、矛盾的或冲突的状态下，或者说，社会关系处于一种很强的张力之中。在这样一种状态之下，社会矛盾比较容易激化，社会问题和社会危机比较容易发生。\n\n27. 所谓中产阶级理论，就是认为现代社会是一个中产阶级会不断扩大的社会。当中产阶级变成了社会上的多数人或社会主体时，下层阶级或低收入者就必然成为社会的少数人群体。这时，社会的一个重要特征是:它在结构上比较稳定。因为，**中产阶级往往对社会的主导价值观有较强的认同感，它往往起到缓解社会对立和社会矛盾的作用**。反之，当中产阶级在社会上仅为少数人时，下层阶级或低收入者的比例就必然较高。这时，一个社会在结构上就处于不稳定状态。因为，下层收入群体对社会的认同感较弱，而反社会的情绪却较强。再者，失去了中产阶层的缓冲作用，上下两层之间容易导致矛盾和冲突。\n\n28. 吉登斯的“统一的中产阶级”，认为从市场能力上，他们有很多相似性。K.罗伯茨，F.G.库克，等提出“破碎的中产阶级”，认为中产阶级是分化成多个阶级的。J.H. 戈德索普倾向于划分细小的阶层，也不同意有一个统一的中产阶级。\n\n29. 社会地位的基础要素，即经济地位、职业地位和教育地位。\n\n30. 笔者认为，在抽象理论研究的意义上，中产阶层的标准包括以下三方面:\n>* 第一，在经济上，该阶层的收入、财产状况以及消费和生活状况不低于小康水平；\n>* 第二，在职业上居于职业地位的中间层次，更具体来说，类似于白领阶层；\n>* 第三，在知识方面，受过较好的教育，一般达到中等以上的教育水平或者受过13年及以上的教育。\n\n31. 中国中产阶级的五个集团。\n>* 第一集团是最典型的就是中产阶级，即专业技术阶层，以及传统的知识分子阶层，其中少部分高级别专家属于更高的阶层。\n>* 第二个集团是各类管理人员，包括企业事业单位的管理人员和广大的干部阶层，其中高层管理者，CEO属于更高的阶层。\n>* 第三个集团是所谓“新中产阶级”，包括科技开发型企业家，国外驻华企业的中方管理人员，国有金融行业中的中高层管理人员，各类专业技术人员。\n>* 第四个集团是效益比较好的国有企业、股份制企业和其他经营比较好的企业、公司、单位的职工层。\n>* 第五个集团是大量的中小产业、中小工商业企业主和所有者。\n\n32. 书中关于收入中产阶级的定义为，城市平均人均可支配收入作为基准线，将基准线3倍一下的定义为“收入中产”，将基准线50%到基准线一下的定义为“收入中下层”，将基准线3倍以上的定为“收入高层”。中产阶层不等于中等收入群体，壮大中产阶层，需要增加老百姓的收入、调整产业结构、普及教育。第三产业是中产阶级壮大的主要就业领域，第二、第三产业内中产阶级已占较大比例，第一产业则存在精英流失的问题。\n\n33. 年轻一代正在崛起，依照数据显示，在大城市中年轻人明显比中老年组收入要高很多，在小城市中却相反。因为年轻一代受教育程度更高，从事的也是新的产业。\n\n34. 参考2014年北京大学“中国家庭追踪调查”第三轮全国调查（COPS)数据，以下指标五个全满足的只有0.26%，满足一个的家庭有42.66%，全都不满足的有22.29%。\n![](/images/WechatIMG12.png)\n\n35. 本研究发现，造成中国中产阶层发展滞后的原因包括:在整个社会财富的分配中，居民家庭收入占比偏低、社会贫富分化比较严重等。\n\n36. 在当前中国的场景下，决定社会地位的因素。第一，权力地位。第二，经济地位。第三，教育地位。第四，技术职称。第五，户籍身份地位。第六，家庭出身，尽管我们一再抨击血统论，但是，在社会生活中，人们很看重一个人的出身，这就是为什么一些自称出身于高级干部家庭的骗子能够屡屡得手的重要原因。\n\n37. 西南财大的“中国家庭调研中心”，认为**2012年中国城乡居民家庭年均收入基尼系数为0.61**。主持该调研的甘犁教授解释说是因为他们采用专门的调查方法，调查出了一些高收入户的真实的高收入数据。\n\n38. 北京大学中国社会科学调查中心公布的数据。该中心发表的《中国民生发展报告（2014）》，公布了关于中国财产分层的数据。**2012年中国家庭财产分布的基尼系数为0.73**，更具体地展示了不同家庭组占有财产的情况是，最高1％家庭占有全部财产的34.6％，最高10％家庭占有全部财产的62.0％，最低25％家庭占有全部财产的1.2％，最低50％家庭占有全部财产的7.3％。\n\n39. 社会是否稳定，最关键的，还是要使全体中国人的基本生活条件得到保障，要使这个民族多数人逐渐富裕起来。戴维斯(J.C.Davies)在他的J曲线理论有做阐释。\n\n40. 所谓市场，讲的是三个方面：第一是商品市场，第二是劳动力市场，第三是金融信用市场。\n\n41. 经济学更多强调效率，社会学更多强调公平，实际上，这是对同一个问题的两种不同视角的分析。在效率与公平的问题上，基本可归结为三大理论流派:\n第一流派是以《资本主义与自由》的作者米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）为代表的自由主义派别，他主张效率优先，主张充分的自由竞争，他认为只有充分自由竞争的社会才能够体现出比较高的效率，而只有很高的效率才能创造出更多的财富，人们才能获得财富的分配。所以他主张充分的竞争和自由，主张废除集中管理的社会福利事业。他把效率放在了首位。\n第二流派以《正义论》一书作者、哈佛大学教授罗尔斯（ John Rawls）为代表，他主张公平至上，他的正义论，含义是公平的意思，他认为如果不能做到使“不平等分配”对每个人都有利那么一切社会资源就应平均分配。以上是两种完全对立的理论。\n第三流派的代表人物是阿瑟·奥肯（Arthur Okun），他主张在效率和公平之间找到一个平衡点。公平和效率两者虽有矛盾的，但是在某些情况下，可以找到一个平衡点。奥肯提出疑问:所有的不公平就一定促进效率吗？他认为不一定，不公平太大，引起了底层工人造反，就既没有公平也没有效率了。反之亦然，比如主张公平就过分地对企业主克以重税，这样的结果往往造成企业主投资、经营积极性的下降，整个社会生产也会随之下降，最终使人们获得的收入减少这样在效率损失的情况下会损伤、破坏社会福利基金，最终也达不到公平。\n\n42. 社会学有一个“精英循环”理论。精英循环理论认为，社会应该有一种制度体系，把不具备精英素质的人淘汰掉，让具备精英素质的人脱颖而出,进入上层。富人集团不是坏事情，但是应该有淘汰机制，让有本事的人上来、没本事的人下去。\n\n43. 贫穷分为绝对贫穷和相对贫穷。绝对贫穷，比如贫困山区等等。相对贫穷，比如城市里的下岗职工。\n\n44. 最近对税收的分析显示，中国个人所得税的纳税大户还是普通的职工层。\n\n45. 社会分层之所以在近几年的中国引起关注，一是持续的社会贫富分化。二是“权利”因素在社会资源分配及其发展机会中，显示出其决定性的作用。三是自上而下与自下而上的社会互动中，一些新的结构要素被“再生产”出来，影响和改变着社会利益关系及社会变迁的走势。\n\n46. 对现阶段中国社会结构变迁机制及其阶级阶层结构变化的分析、解释，社会学界主要有四种不同的判断，第一种，是陆学艺教授任组长的“当代中国社会结构变迁研究”课题组提出的，可称为“层化论”；第二种，主要是笔者提出的“集团论”；第三种，也主要是由笔者提出的“碎片论”；第四种，是孙立平教授提出的“断裂论”。除上述四种理论以外，对中国社会分层机制中的一些重要问题，如阶级阶层关系的传递、阶层认知、性别分层等，一些社会学学者也提出了经相关实证研究初步验证了的一些命题，如“阶层关系双重再生产模式”“阶层认知的相对剥夺论”等。\n\n47. 仇立平对上海的社会分层研究中，以“职业地位”作为社会分层的标准，认为现阶段上海存在界限分明的五大社会阶层:\n>* 第一，上上阶层，以领导干部为主，包括私人企业主、外商代理人在内的职业群体；\n>* 第二，中上阶层，以办事人员或职员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第三，中间阶层，以各类专业技术人员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第四，中下阶层，以商业从业人员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第五，下下阶层，以工人、农民、居民生活服务业人员为主的职业群体。\n\n这五大社会阶层基本上是“金字塔型”结构。被调查者认同自己家庭属于上上层的占被调查者的0.5％，中上阶层的占5.6％，中间阶层的占52.7％，中下阶层的占35.8％，下下阶层的占5.4％。大部分人将自己的家庭看作是中间或中间偏下的阶层。来自《职业地位：社会分层的指示器——上海社会结构与社会分层研究》载《社会学研究》2001年第3期。\n\n48. 对工业化社会中的新中产阶层，在西方有关社会分层研究中并未形成统一的定义，这与“新中产阶级并未组成一个紧凑单纯的阶层”有关。然而，研究者一般均认为，他们具有如下一些基本的阶层群体特征:\n>* 第一，职业构成以各种工程技术人员、科学研究人员、包括政府雇员在内的各级政治和经济管理、技术工作者等的脑力劳动职业为主要成分；\n>* 第二，除少数高级政府官员和高层企业管理人员外，他们已形成了一个由“靠工资谋生”的雇佣劳动者组成的集团；\n>* 第三，他们的经济地位和政治待遇，一般来说明显优于体力劳动者——他们中的相当一部分人，都程度不同地拥有对劳动过程的直接控制权；\n>* 第四，他们的政治态度、生活方式、个人素养、行为准则以及价值观念，不仅和普通的体力劳动者有着明显的区别，并且在相当程度上影响着社会意识形态；\n>* 第五，他们积极参与社会公共事务，并对社会公共事务管理拥有一定的发言权及影响力。\n\n49. 李春玲教授认为“中产人群”不认可中产身份，即被学界定义为中产的人群，将自己认同为中下阶层和下层阶层的比例相对较高原因之一在于，高速的经济增长和急剧的社会变迁下，出现了一种社会心态，即极强的物质欲望追求以及由此导致的不满足感和缺乏安全感，这种心态使他们总觉得未达到理想的中产生活状态。\n\n50. 熊易寒通过对上海J镇的田野调查发现，中产阶级在维护自身权益时，更倾向于采用协商的方式而非依法抗争。为了降低政治风险，中产阶级采取“忠诚呼吁”策略，即以基层政府作为忠诚对象和潜在的结盟对象，以地方政府的政绩作为谈判筹码。这种全新的维权模式完全不同于依法抗争的方式。\n\n51. 郭巍蓉、王正芬通过把医生作为体制内中产阶级，从业者作为体制外中产阶级，投资银行从业者为依附于体制的中产阶级的代表，对三个专业技术中产群体的比较分析来探究体制位置对中产阶级的社会变迁观的影响。研究发现体制位置以“市场化程度”和“体制身份定义-利益获取形态”作为中间机制，导致了三个群体在对社会改革主要力量为何的看法、对社会未来的预期上，行为模式上的差异。按照“与体制关系”和“与体制的合作性”两个维度，将利益划分为四种类型，医生与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性较弱，带来的是委身型利益，他们对体制的态度很复杂；投行从业者与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性也强，带来的是寄生型利益，对未来的预期徘徊于乐观与悲观之间；IT从业者与体制是弱关系，与体制的合作性也很弱，带来的是独立型利益，这种利益事实上与体制无关。因此可以说，**体制位置是研究中产阶级的政治态度和行为的一个重要变量**。\n\n52. 黄嘉文调查分析发现，当前中国的收入不平等会损害个人对幸福的积极体验。国民幸福感的高低并不取决于收入不平等本身，而是分配体系构建的合理性。\n\n53. 叶晓阳，丁延庆利用2011年首都高校生发展状况调查数据，发现在首都高校间出现了学生分层，来自社会优势阶层家庭的学生具有更大的概率进入精英学校。如果高等教育扩张使高德教育更具有“合法性”而非“效率”，进而带来教育质量的下降，那么，高等教育对社会阶层流动的促进作用将会削弱。1999年的高等教育扩张，**实际上削弱了高等教育对社会流动的作用，而强化了社会阶层的复制**。来自，《扩张的中国高德教育：教育质量与社会分层》。\n","source":"_posts/当代中国社会分层.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

我们考察有文字记载以来的人类历史，还没有发现哪一个社会能够将人们的地位完全拉平；就是没有文字记载的社会，据称所谓“母系社会”“父系社会”，至少性别造成的地位差异也是显而易见的。\n\n3. 改革开放之前，是以“先赋因素”来确认人身份的身份制，比如户籍、家庭出身，严重限制了社会流动性。\n\n4. 社会结构是指社会各要素和各部分相互之间的一种比较稳定的关系模式或互动模式。\n\n5. 一般认为，从社会学家韦伯开始提出了三元社会分层的观点：即财产地位分层、权利地位分层和声望地位分层。其实，有多少种社会资源，就可以有多少种不同的社会分层或社会分层结构。\n\n6. 消除差异的公平观和地位准入的公平观。\n\n7. 我国社会分层现象的特点：\n>* 社会分层差异巨大\n>* 城乡分野\n>* 金字塔型社会结构\n>* 身份等级社会\n>* 官民社会\n>* 精英层的巨大作用\n>* 社会基础群体的重大社会功能\n>* 社会流动机制的特点\n>* 家庭纽带弥合社会差异的重要功能\n\n8. 伦斯基认为，社会结构、社会分层的核心问题是两个：第一，谁得到了什么？第二，为什么得到？\n\n9. 中国近70年资源配置的手段，政府干预、市场机制、权利的作用、单位的作用、老百姓的博弈。\n\n10. 乌坎事件。\n\n11. 起到缓解社会矛盾的机制：第一，基层组织的“缓冲机制。第二，传统单位体制的“缓冲机制”功能。第三，政治身份群体“缓冲机制”。第四，新的社会保障机制起到了缓冲社会矛盾的功能。第五，子女地位上升对父母地位下降的补偿功能。第六，家庭内部的经济互助，这是最具有中国特色的社会缓冲机制。\n\n12. 欧美发达国家社会分层演化的特点：第一，从传统的贵族与平民的身份制度演变为雇主与雇员的阶级分层制度。第二，农业劳动阶级的衰落和工业劳动阶级的兴起。第三，职业分层成为社会分层的基础。第四，白领阶层在人数和比例上均超过蓝领阶层。第五，庞大的中产阶级队伍的形成。第六，生产力的高度发展。第七，严格税收制度缓解了贫富分化。第八，社会保障制度使社会上绝大多数人都能享受到基本的福利。\n\n13. 帕金(Frank Parkin)，社会屏蔽理论。\n\n14. 有必要阐释一下什么是“身份”。在社会学上，马克斯·韦伯最早也最为系统地阐述了身份（ status）和身份群体（ status group）的概念。**韦伯认为:“身份”指的是在社会声望方面可以有效地得到的肯定或否定的特权**，它建立在如下一种或数种因素基础之上:a生活方式；b正式的教育过程，包括实际经验的训练或理性的训练，及与此相对应的生活方式；c.因出身或因职业而获得的声望。”①韦伯认为，身份与阶级不同，**阶级是由客观经济指标决定的分层体系，而身份是由主观社会评价决定的**。韦伯身份概念的复杂性在于，一方面强调了身份是主观社会评价上的地位，另一方面又强调身份有客观生活方式、教育、职业、出身作为基础。身份制就是建立在上述身份基础上的一套由法律、法规、规范认可的制度体系。\n\n15. 白领阶层和中间阶层形成的基本条件。第一，要有产业变迁的条件，即它一般形成于第二产业向第三产业转型的过程之中。第二，这实际上是一个职业变迁的问题。第三，和教育有关系。\n\n16. 改革开放以来中国社会分层结构的变迁。一，身份制的变迁。二，单位制的变迁。三，经济分层取代政治分层。四，社会中心群体与社会边缘群体关系的变化。五，新的社会阶层形成。\n\n17. “利益碎片化”的一个重要表现是，人们从过去的那种仅仅追求整体利益，转变为今天的追求个体利益。每个人都追求个体利益，这样，追求利益的方向就非常不一致，这样就形成不了整体的社会运动。社会就不会产生整体的冲突。\n\n18. ①［法］列斐伏尔（HemiTebwe）:《空间:社会产物与使用价值》夏铸九等编译，收录《空间的文化形式与社会理论读本》，台北明文书局，2002年版，第20-21页。\n\n19. “社区碎片化”引发的后果。\n>* 第一，社区之间的分化或“碎片化”，造成了社会关系的失衡。\n>* 第二，社区内部的“碎片化”，斩断了人们的交往，社区失去了共同体的意义。\n>* 第三，利益的“碎片化”加剧了社会矛盾与冲突。第四，权利的“碎片化”造成了管理的真空。\n\n20. 笔者以为，所谓利益群体，核心问题说的是“在物质利益上，地位相近的人所构成的群体”或者说在经济利益上，地位相近的人所构成的群体”。\n\n21. 知识分子是市场发展第一阶段政治地位上升最快的群体，从政治地位很低的群体上升为政治地位较高的群体。90年代以来，随着市场发展进入第二个阶段、知识分子又成为市场改革的经济上的获益者在这一阶段，与其他群体相比较，知识分子又成为经济地位相对上升较快的群体。所以，知识分子在市场转型的两个阶段都是获益者。在第一个阶段，知识分子获得了政治利益，在第二个阶段，知识分子获得了经济利益。因此，我们可以判断，知识分子是中国经济社会现代化改革中最为典型的获益群体。由此可以判断，知识分子会成为我国现代化改革的最主要的支持者。\n\n22. 当然，对于社会保障、社会福利制度与底层群体的关系，学界一直是有争论的。赞同推进福利保障制度的一派认为，社会福利、社会保障制度是现代社会不可缺少的制度环节，这样的制度对跌入底层的人群起到了救助作用，减轻了底层的贫困程度，使得他们不至于产生生存危机，最终有利于全社会的和谐。而批评福利保障制度的一派认为，奉行了多年福利保障制度的所谓发达国家也并未能消灭贫困现象，有时候，贫困甚至有所加剧，这是因为，福利保障制度只是貌似公允，实际上，它反而是造成贫困层之原因。这又可以分为激进主义者与保守主义者。**激进主义者**认为:“表面看来福利制度是济贫，其实，政府发放的福利、救济金数额较少，只能使穷人维持在贫困的生活水平上。这样，救济金实际上在制造着一个贫困阶层。这个阶层生活困苦，却由于保障制度而尚能存活。因此，福利制度阻止了穷人贫困状况的根本改善。”而**保守主义者**则认为:“福利制度之所以造成了贫困，不在于它阻止了社会制度的根本变革，而是因为社会福利、保障与救济的开支过大，它使社会再生产受到抑制，使投资减少，结果限制了财富与新的就业机会的增长，最终加剧了社会上一部分人的贫困化。”\n\n23. 最早提出“相对剥夺”范式的是美国社会学斯托夫（S. Stouffer他认为，“相对剥夺感”是社会不满和社会动荡的重要源泉。**“相对剥夺感”**是一种很矛盾的心理状态。此种心态的产生是由于，人们将自己的命运与那些既和自己的地位相近，又不完全等同于自己的人或群体做反向的比较。此种心态变得强烈是由于，人们所对比的群体变成了自己的潜在对手。社会学家默顿（R. Merton）则用“参照群体”（ reference group）的理论来解释“相对剥夺感”，**即关键是人们将哪一个群体视为自己的参照群体、同哪一个群体比较**。\n\n24. 贫困文化理论，刘易斯\n\n25. 中国社会的四个利益群体，即特殊获益群体，普通获益群体，利益相对受损群体和社会底层群体。\n\n26. 而笔者所说的“社会结构紧张是指社会结构的不协调，使得社会群体之间的关系处在一种对立的、矛盾的或冲突的状态下，或者说，社会关系处于一种很强的张力之中。在这样一种状态之下，社会矛盾比较容易激化，社会问题和社会危机比较容易发生。\n\n27. 所谓中产阶级理论，就是认为现代社会是一个中产阶级会不断扩大的社会。当中产阶级变成了社会上的多数人或社会主体时，下层阶级或低收入者就必然成为社会的少数人群体。这时，社会的一个重要特征是:它在结构上比较稳定。因为，**中产阶级往往对社会的主导价值观有较强的认同感，它往往起到缓解社会对立和社会矛盾的作用**。反之，当中产阶级在社会上仅为少数人时，下层阶级或低收入者的比例就必然较高。这时，一个社会在结构上就处于不稳定状态。因为，下层收入群体对社会的认同感较弱，而反社会的情绪却较强。再者，失去了中产阶层的缓冲作用，上下两层之间容易导致矛盾和冲突。\n\n28. 吉登斯的“统一的中产阶级”，认为从市场能力上，他们有很多相似性。K.罗伯茨，F.G.库克，等提出“破碎的中产阶级”，认为中产阶级是分化成多个阶级的。J.H. 戈德索普倾向于划分细小的阶层，也不同意有一个统一的中产阶级。\n\n29. 社会地位的基础要素，即经济地位、职业地位和教育地位。\n\n30. 笔者认为，在抽象理论研究的意义上，中产阶层的标准包括以下三方面:\n>* 第一，在经济上，该阶层的收入、财产状况以及消费和生活状况不低于小康水平；\n>* 第二，在职业上居于职业地位的中间层次，更具体来说，类似于白领阶层；\n>* 第三，在知识方面，受过较好的教育，一般达到中等以上的教育水平或者受过13年及以上的教育。\n\n31. 中国中产阶级的五个集团。\n>* 第一集团是最典型的就是中产阶级，即专业技术阶层，以及传统的知识分子阶层，其中少部分高级别专家属于更高的阶层。\n>* 第二个集团是各类管理人员，包括企业事业单位的管理人员和广大的干部阶层，其中高层管理者，CEO属于更高的阶层。\n>* 第三个集团是所谓“新中产阶级”，包括科技开发型企业家，国外驻华企业的中方管理人员，国有金融行业中的中高层管理人员，各类专业技术人员。\n>* 第四个集团是效益比较好的国有企业、股份制企业和其他经营比较好的企业、公司、单位的职工层。\n>* 第五个集团是大量的中小产业、中小工商业企业主和所有者。\n\n32. 书中关于收入中产阶级的定义为，城市平均人均可支配收入作为基准线，将基准线3倍一下的定义为“收入中产”，将基准线50%到基准线一下的定义为“收入中下层”，将基准线3倍以上的定为“收入高层”。中产阶层不等于中等收入群体，壮大中产阶层，需要增加老百姓的收入、调整产业结构、普及教育。第三产业是中产阶级壮大的主要就业领域，第二、第三产业内中产阶级已占较大比例，第一产业则存在精英流失的问题。\n\n33. 年轻一代正在崛起，依照数据显示，在大城市中年轻人明显比中老年组收入要高很多，在小城市中却相反。因为年轻一代受教育程度更高，从事的也是新的产业。\n\n34. 参考2014年北京大学“中国家庭追踪调查”第三轮全国调查（COPS)数据，以下指标五个全满足的只有0.26%，满足一个的家庭有42.66%，全都不满足的有22.29%。\n![](/images/WechatIMG12.png)\n\n35. 本研究发现，造成中国中产阶层发展滞后的原因包括:在整个社会财富的分配中，居民家庭收入占比偏低、社会贫富分化比较严重等。\n\n36. 在当前中国的场景下，决定社会地位的因素。第一，权力地位。第二，经济地位。第三，教育地位。第四，技术职称。第五，户籍身份地位。第六，家庭出身，尽管我们一再抨击血统论，但是，在社会生活中，人们很看重一个人的出身，这就是为什么一些自称出身于高级干部家庭的骗子能够屡屡得手的重要原因。\n\n37. 西南财大的“中国家庭调研中心”，认为**2012年中国城乡居民家庭年均收入基尼系数为0.61**。主持该调研的甘犁教授解释说是因为他们采用专门的调查方法，调查出了一些高收入户的真实的高收入数据。\n\n38. 北京大学中国社会科学调查中心公布的数据。该中心发表的《中国民生发展报告（2014）》，公布了关于中国财产分层的数据。**2012年中国家庭财产分布的基尼系数为0.73**，更具体地展示了不同家庭组占有财产的情况是，最高1％家庭占有全部财产的34.6％，最高10％家庭占有全部财产的62.0％，最低25％家庭占有全部财产的1.2％，最低50％家庭占有全部财产的7.3％。\n\n39. 社会是否稳定，最关键的，还是要使全体中国人的基本生活条件得到保障，要使这个民族多数人逐渐富裕起来。戴维斯(J.C.Davies)在他的J曲线理论有做阐释。\n\n40. 所谓市场，讲的是三个方面：第一是商品市场，第二是劳动力市场，第三是金融信用市场。\n\n41. 经济学更多强调效率，社会学更多强调公平，实际上，这是对同一个问题的两种不同视角的分析。在效率与公平的问题上，基本可归结为三大理论流派:\n第一流派是以《资本主义与自由》的作者米尔顿·弗里德曼（Milton Friedman）为代表的自由主义派别，他主张效率优先，主张充分的自由竞争，他认为只有充分自由竞争的社会才能够体现出比较高的效率，而只有很高的效率才能创造出更多的财富，人们才能获得财富的分配。所以他主张充分的竞争和自由，主张废除集中管理的社会福利事业。他把效率放在了首位。\n第二流派以《正义论》一书作者、哈佛大学教授罗尔斯（ John Rawls）为代表，他主张公平至上，他的正义论，含义是公平的意思，他认为如果不能做到使“不平等分配”对每个人都有利那么一切社会资源就应平均分配。以上是两种完全对立的理论。\n第三流派的代表人物是阿瑟·奥肯（Arthur Okun），他主张在效率和公平之间找到一个平衡点。公平和效率两者虽有矛盾的，但是在某些情况下，可以找到一个平衡点。奥肯提出疑问:所有的不公平就一定促进效率吗？他认为不一定，不公平太大，引起了底层工人造反，就既没有公平也没有效率了。反之亦然，比如主张公平就过分地对企业主克以重税，这样的结果往往造成企业主投资、经营积极性的下降，整个社会生产也会随之下降，最终使人们获得的收入减少这样在效率损失的情况下会损伤、破坏社会福利基金，最终也达不到公平。\n\n42. 社会学有一个“精英循环”理论。精英循环理论认为，社会应该有一种制度体系，把不具备精英素质的人淘汰掉，让具备精英素质的人脱颖而出,进入上层。富人集团不是坏事情，但是应该有淘汰机制，让有本事的人上来、没本事的人下去。\n\n43. 贫穷分为绝对贫穷和相对贫穷。绝对贫穷，比如贫困山区等等。相对贫穷，比如城市里的下岗职工。\n\n44. 最近对税收的分析显示，中国个人所得税的纳税大户还是普通的职工层。\n\n45. 社会分层之所以在近几年的中国引起关注，一是持续的社会贫富分化。二是“权利”因素在社会资源分配及其发展机会中，显示出其决定性的作用。三是自上而下与自下而上的社会互动中，一些新的结构要素被“再生产”出来，影响和改变着社会利益关系及社会变迁的走势。\n\n46. 对现阶段中国社会结构变迁机制及其阶级阶层结构变化的分析、解释，社会学界主要有四种不同的判断，第一种，是陆学艺教授任组长的“当代中国社会结构变迁研究”课题组提出的，可称为“层化论”；第二种，主要是笔者提出的“集团论”；第三种，也主要是由笔者提出的“碎片论”；第四种，是孙立平教授提出的“断裂论”。除上述四种理论以外，对中国社会分层机制中的一些重要问题，如阶级阶层关系的传递、阶层认知、性别分层等，一些社会学学者也提出了经相关实证研究初步验证了的一些命题，如“阶层关系双重再生产模式”“阶层认知的相对剥夺论”等。\n\n47. 仇立平对上海的社会分层研究中，以“职业地位”作为社会分层的标准，认为现阶段上海存在界限分明的五大社会阶层:\n>* 第一，上上阶层，以领导干部为主，包括私人企业主、外商代理人在内的职业群体；\n>* 第二，中上阶层，以办事人员或职员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第三，中间阶层，以各类专业技术人员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第四，中下阶层，以商业从业人员为主的职业群体；\n>* 第五，下下阶层，以工人、农民、居民生活服务业人员为主的职业群体。\n\n这五大社会阶层基本上是“金字塔型”结构。被调查者认同自己家庭属于上上层的占被调查者的0.5％，中上阶层的占5.6％，中间阶层的占52.7％，中下阶层的占35.8％，下下阶层的占5.4％。大部分人将自己的家庭看作是中间或中间偏下的阶层。来自《职业地位：社会分层的指示器——上海社会结构与社会分层研究》载《社会学研究》2001年第3期。\n\n48. 对工业化社会中的新中产阶层，在西方有关社会分层研究中并未形成统一的定义，这与“新中产阶级并未组成一个紧凑单纯的阶层”有关。然而，研究者一般均认为，他们具有如下一些基本的阶层群体特征:\n>* 第一，职业构成以各种工程技术人员、科学研究人员、包括政府雇员在内的各级政治和经济管理、技术工作者等的脑力劳动职业为主要成分；\n>* 第二，除少数高级政府官员和高层企业管理人员外，他们已形成了一个由“靠工资谋生”的雇佣劳动者组成的集团；\n>* 第三，他们的经济地位和政治待遇，一般来说明显优于体力劳动者——他们中的相当一部分人，都程度不同地拥有对劳动过程的直接控制权；\n>* 第四，他们的政治态度、生活方式、个人素养、行为准则以及价值观念，不仅和普通的体力劳动者有着明显的区别，并且在相当程度上影响着社会意识形态；\n>* 第五，他们积极参与社会公共事务，并对社会公共事务管理拥有一定的发言权及影响力。\n\n49. 李春玲教授认为“中产人群”不认可中产身份，即被学界定义为中产的人群，将自己认同为中下阶层和下层阶层的比例相对较高原因之一在于，高速的经济增长和急剧的社会变迁下，出现了一种社会心态，即极强的物质欲望追求以及由此导致的不满足感和缺乏安全感，这种心态使他们总觉得未达到理想的中产生活状态。\n\n50. 熊易寒通过对上海J镇的田野调查发现，中产阶级在维护自身权益时，更倾向于采用协商的方式而非依法抗争。为了降低政治风险，中产阶级采取“忠诚呼吁”策略，即以基层政府作为忠诚对象和潜在的结盟对象，以地方政府的政绩作为谈判筹码。这种全新的维权模式完全不同于依法抗争的方式。\n\n51. 郭巍蓉、王正芬通过把医生作为体制内中产阶级，从业者作为体制外中产阶级，投资银行从业者为依附于体制的中产阶级的代表，对三个专业技术中产群体的比较分析来探究体制位置对中产阶级的社会变迁观的影响。研究发现体制位置以“市场化程度”和“体制身份定义-利益获取形态”作为中间机制，导致了三个群体在对社会改革主要力量为何的看法、对社会未来的预期上，行为模式上的差异。按照“与体制关系”和“与体制的合作性”两个维度，将利益划分为四种类型，医生与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性较弱，带来的是委身型利益，他们对体制的态度很复杂；投行从业者与体制是强关系，与体制的合作性也强，带来的是寄生型利益，对未来的预期徘徊于乐观与悲观之间；IT从业者与体制是弱关系，与体制的合作性也很弱，带来的是独立型利益，这种利益事实上与体制无关。因此可以说，**体制位置是研究中产阶级的政治态度和行为的一个重要变量**。\n\n52. 黄嘉文调查分析发现，当前中国的收入不平等会损害个人对幸福的积极体验。国民幸福感的高低并不取决于收入不平等本身，而是分配体系构建的合理性。\n\n53. 叶晓阳，丁延庆利用2011年首都高校生发展状况调查数据，发现在首都高校间出现了学生分层，来自社会优势阶层家庭的学生具有更大的概率进入精英学校。如果高等教育扩张使高德教育更具有“合法性”而非“效率”，进而带来教育质量的下降，那么，高等教育对社会阶层流动的促进作用将会削弱。1999年的高等教育扩张，**实际上削弱了高等教育对社会流动的作用，而强化了社会阶层的复制**。来自，《扩张的中国高德教育：教育质量与社会分层》。\n","slug":"当代中国社会分层","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.504Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vksl004spmnk6b5g5jow","content":"<ol

John\nRawls）为代表，他主张公平至上，他的正义论，含义是公平的意思，他认为如果不能做到使“不平等分配”对每个人都有利那么一切社会资源就应平均分配。以上是两种完全对立的理论。\n第三流派的代表人物是阿瑟·奥肯（Arthur\nOkun），他主张在效率和公平之间找到一个平衡点。公平和效率两者虽有矛盾的，但是在某些情况下，可以找到一个平衡点。奥肯提出疑问:所有的不公平就一定促进效率吗？他认为不一定，不公平太大，引起了底层工人造反，就既没有公平也没有效率了。反之亦然，比如主张公平就过分地对企业主克以重税，这样的结果往往造成企业主投资、经营积极性的下降，整个社会生产也会随之下降，最终使人们获得的收入减少这样在效率损失的情况下会损伤、破坏社会福利基金，最终也达不到公平。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会学有一个“精英循环”理论。精英循环理论认为，社会应该有一种制度体系，把不具备精英素质的人淘汰掉，让具备精英素质的人脱颖而出,进入上层。富人集团不是坏事情，但是应该有淘汰机制，让有本事的人上来、没本事的人下去。</p></li>\n<li><p>贫穷分为绝对贫穷和相对贫穷。绝对贫穷，比如贫困山区等等。相对贫穷，比如城市里的下岗职工。</p></li>\n<li><p>最近对税收的分析显示，中国个人所得税的纳税大户还是普通的职工层。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会分层之所以在近几年的中国引起关注，一是持续的社会贫富分化。二是“权利”因素在社会资源分配及其发展机会中，显示出其决定性的作用。三是自上而下与自下而上的社会互动中，一些新的结构要素被“再生产”出来，影响和改变着社会利益关系及社会变迁的走势。</p></li>\n<li><p>对现阶段中国社会结构变迁机制及其阶级阶层结构变化的分析、解释，社会学界主要有四种不同的判断，第一种，是陆学艺教授任组长的“当代中国社会结构变迁研究”课题组提出的，可称为“层化论”；第二种，主要是笔者提出的“集团论”；第三种，也主要是由笔者提出的“碎片论”；第四种，是孙立平教授提出的“断裂论”。除上述四种理论以外，对中国社会分层机制中的一些重要问题，如阶级阶层关系的传递、阶层认知、性别分层等，一些社会学学者也提出了经相关实证研究初步验证了的一些命题，如“阶层关系双重再生产模式”“阶层认知的相对剥夺论”等。</p></li>\n<li><p>仇立平对上海的社会分层研究中，以“职业地位”作为社会分层的标准，认为现阶段上海存在界限分明的五大社会阶层:\n&gt;*\n第一，上上阶层，以领导干部为主，包括私人企业主、外商代理人在内的职业群体；\n&gt;* 第二，中上阶层，以办事人员或职员为主的职业群体； &gt;*\n第三，中间阶层，以各类专业技术人员为主的职业群体； &gt;*\n第四，中下阶层，以商业从业人员为主的职业群体；

John\nRawls）为代表，他主张公平至上，他的正义论，含义是公平的意思，他认为如果不能做到使“不平等分配”对每个人都有利那么一切社会资源就应平均分配。以上是两种完全对立的理论。\n第三流派的代表人物是阿瑟·奥肯（Arthur\nOkun），他主张在效率和公平之间找到一个平衡点。公平和效率两者虽有矛盾的，但是在某些情况下，可以找到一个平衡点。奥肯提出疑问:所有的不公平就一定促进效率吗？他认为不一定，不公平太大，引起了底层工人造反，就既没有公平也没有效率了。反之亦然，比如主张公平就过分地对企业主克以重税，这样的结果往往造成企业主投资、经营积极性的下降，整个社会生产也会随之下降，最终使人们获得的收入减少这样在效率损失的情况下会损伤、破坏社会福利基金，最终也达不到公平。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会学有一个“精英循环”理论。精英循环理论认为，社会应该有一种制度体系，把不具备精英素质的人淘汰掉，让具备精英素质的人脱颖而出,进入上层。富人集团不是坏事情，但是应该有淘汰机制，让有本事的人上来、没本事的人下去。</p></li>\n<li><p>贫穷分为绝对贫穷和相对贫穷。绝对贫穷，比如贫困山区等等。相对贫穷，比如城市里的下岗职工。</p></li>\n<li><p>最近对税收的分析显示，中国个人所得税的纳税大户还是普通的职工层。</p></li>\n<li><p>社会分层之所以在近几年的中国引起关注，一是持续的社会贫富分化。二是“权利”因素在社会资源分配及其发展机会中，显示出其决定性的作用。三是自上而下与自下而上的社会互动中，一些新的结构要素被“再生产”出来，影响和改变着社会利益关系及社会变迁的走势。</p></li>\n<li><p>对现阶段中国社会结构变迁机制及其阶级阶层结构变化的分析、解释，社会学界主要有四种不同的判断，第一种，是陆学艺教授任组长的“当代中国社会结构变迁研究”课题组提出的，可称为“层化论”；第二种，主要是笔者提出的“集团论”；第三种，也主要是由笔者提出的“碎片论”；第四种，是孙立平教授提出的“断裂论”。除上述四种理论以外，对中国社会分层机制中的一些重要问题，如阶级阶层关系的传递、阶层认知、性别分层等，一些社会学学者也提出了经相关实证研究初步验证了的一些命题，如“阶层关系双重再生产模式”“阶层认知的相对剥夺论”等。</p></li>\n<li><p>仇立平对上海的社会分层研究中，以“职业地位”作为社会分层的标准，认为现阶段上海存在界限分明的五大社会阶层:\n&gt;*\n第一，上上阶层，以领导干部为主，包括私人企业主、外商代理人在内的职业群体；\n&gt;* 第二，中上阶层，以办事人员或职员为主的职业群体； &gt;*\n第三，中间阶层，以各类专业技术人员为主的职业群体； &gt;*\n第四，中下阶层，以商业从业人员为主的职业群体； &gt;*\n第五，下下阶层，以工人、农民、居民生活服务业人员为主的职业群体。</p></li>\n</ol>\n<p>这五大社会阶层基本上是“金字塔型”结构。被调查者认同自己家庭属于上上层的占被调查者的0.5％，中上阶层的占5.6％，中间阶层的占52.7％，中下阶层的占35.8％，下下阶层的占5.4％。大部分人将自己的家庭看作是中间或中间偏下的阶层。来自《职业地位：社会分层的指示器——上海社会结构与社会分层研究》载《社会学研究》2001年第3期。</p>\n<ol

11:16:38\n---\n\n该怀着何种的心情来看待2020年呢？真的想了好久都想不到一个具体的词。因为2020年有着太多的回忆可以书写纪念了。于我而言，可以用一个词来形容，那就是戛然而止。以下都是写给自己的怀念，一不小心写了四千六百多字。\n<!--more-->\n\n年初，当在网上出现SARS的零星报道时，想着也没什么吧，毕竟当年SARS出现的时候，我还很小，完全没有任何记忆，但是谁也没想到这次突然变成了很长时间的封锁。我也是后来查资料才知道，当年山西是一个重灾区。本来还想着绕道北京去回家，最后选择了直接买机票回去。还有本来准备春节后去四川参加同学的婚礼，也不得不取消掉了。于是，整个上半年突然就变成了戛然而止。关于疫情，有着太多太多的事迹可以书写了。但，当时代的尘埃落在一个个人的头上时，就是生死决别了。\n\n\n于我个人而言，我自己获得了难得的喘息机会，因为之前给自己弄了太多的压力，一时之间突然可以停下来思考一下自己到底想要什么，想要如何行走，反而也许是一件庆幸的事情。一切的一切都有着需要停下来思考的必要。\n\n上半年，因为封锁，厨艺有了进步，学了一些新的菜，也能成功分清楚很多蔬菜的名字了，成功把自己喂胖了很多，直到最近才又开始减下来。就也算是学到了一项新的技能，还有很多自己还不会做的，就留给以后的自己打磨吧。\n\n\n整个2020年，看了两百多部番剧和电影，有很多非常棒的作品，真的非常优秀，里面带着大量的思考和表达，每一代人都有着相同的迷惘和思考，其中最多的问题就是如何活下去，怎样活下去。每一代人也都有着不一样的困境，面对着不一样的具体问题，但是如何活下去却是贯穿在整个历史长河中的过程。\n\n\n《吹响悠风号》里高中少女在青春的上低音号。《极速车王》里对自己执着的坚持。《何以为家》里战乱弱国下的孩童的生存。《凪的新生活》中为了追求真实的自己付出的行动。《乔乔的异想世界》和《帝国的毁灭》中对于疯狂不一样的视角。《理查德·朱维尔的哀歌》根据现实改编的事件。《卡拉是条狗》中对现实的隐喻。《钢琴家》中，人间地狱，满目疮痍，活着就是一种幸运了。《牯岭街少年杀人事件》和《一秒钟》中时代的映照。《隐秘的角落》中恶的距离。《恋恋笔记本》和《花与爱丽丝》中兜兜转转的爱。《菊次郎的夏天》中菊次郎的成长。《八佰》中纵身一跳，家国难两全。《妙先生》和《姜子牙》中的善恶抉择。《雾山五行》、《一人之下》等一系列国漫的崛起。《人工智能》、《幸福终点站》、《遗愿清单》、《绿里奇迹》、《穿条纹睡衣的男孩》、《阳光灿烂的日子》等老片所带来的经典回味。《汉密尔顿》、《迷墙》等音乐带来的魅力。有着太多太多的的优秀作品可以拿来仔细品味了。即便如此，我也还有巨长的看片清单还没看完。\n\n\n当停下来的时候，仔细想想，这个世界有答案吗？我们总是试图去解释自己，试图去解释这个世界，可是很多时候，这个世界并没有答案。很多时候得到的答案，都是我们自己希望得到的答案，这个世界也许并不在乎。可是即便如此，我们依然需要寻找自己的答案，自己内心的答案究竟在什么地方，也许就在身边，也许还需要去远方寻找。\n\n\n2020年，对自己的包容心，又有了新的认知。我想，这就是所谓的阅历吧，随着阅历的增加，对事物的理解也开始有了更多不一样的内容，也越来越不会被无关的东西困扰了，也能分的了孰轻孰重。要说起来，2019年，是自己脾气见涨的一年，那么2020年就是趋于缓和的一年，重新开始包容理解，而不是之前的同情和赐予。\n\n2020年很惭愧，读的书很少，一部分原因是因为有些书真的难读，需要花费很多时间，另一部分原因还是自己心态的调节问题，自己去理解东西比别人塞给你东西，还是要难坚持一些。其中有一些和社会学相关的书，仔细思考之后发现，自己只是喜欢社会学中关于一些现象的解读，而不是喜欢整个社会学学科，也不会打算深入去研究社会学，获取见解观点对我来说已经足够了。毕竟作为一整个社会学学科来说，真的有太多的东西要去学习和理解。在这里重点说几本我读过的书。\n\n\n《资本主义的未来》，本来对这本书没报什么期待，毕竟是对西方世界的思考，但是读完作者对当下社会的思考之后，的确深感佩服，也会发现，中国也开始有一些这些问题的影子了。当下的社会的主要问题有，民粹主义和意识形态分子的问题。我想，尤其关注过美国大选和香港问题的人，对这些有更多的深刻印象。简单的道德确定性和对立的二元关系，非黑即白，造就了当下的社会环境，不管是国内还是国外，尤其我们现在身处的互联网时代，信息茧房带来的封闭环境，问题尤其明显，稍微出圈一点点，就会发现有大量的网络暴力存在。相关的案例有很多，这里不做表述。这就是我们现在的社会现实，书中关于这一点也提出了很多自己的解决之道。其中有一条就是，构建新的共同身份的认同。可是和而不同这句话，老祖宗很早就留给我们了，但是新的问题依然出现，依然需要很多的努力。\n\n\n这就涉及到第二本书了《现实的社会构建》，这是一本社会学入门的书，讲了很多基础社会学要素。有几个很关键的观点，其中提到，知识社会的分析对象就是现实的社会构建，社会的传统是会被继承的，但是同时又存在代际间的差异。很多习惯并非是明文规定的，或者对生存真的有帮助的东西，但是会被传承下去，仅仅是因为这种模式被惯例化了下来。也有的会因为代际传承的太多，导致出现了变异，比如你和你爷爷一辈的习惯可能完全不一样，也许仅仅是因为权威的被打破与生存无关。里面讲了很多在社会的构建过程中，会出现的问题和原因。对于理解社会学来说，真的很有帮助。\n\n\n还有一本书是《当代中国社会分层》，总听到一句话，当下的中国社会在渐渐地阶层固化中，但是这个问题到底有多严重，这本书提供了一些数据上的支持。整体而言，我们的国家并不是一个纺锤形的社会阶层，更像是哑铃形的，就是中间阶层比较少，穷人比较多的一个样子。2020年，是国家全面脱贫的一年，虽然书上的数据很多是五六年前的数据了，但是依然对我们在现实中思考中国的时候提供了很多参考。比如里面有提到，在当前中国的场景下，决定社会地位的因素。第一，权力地位。第二，经济地位。第三，教育地位。第四，技术职称。第五，户籍身份地位。第六，家庭出身。这些也恐怕依然是现实。\n\n\n对于小说，读完了《魔山》《你当像鸟飞往你的山》《人间失格》等，这几本书都很有意思。《魔山》中提到了大量的历史主义，现实主义等等的辩论，对于那个20世纪上半叶来说，真的是很出色的作品，就是有些难读，花了蛮长时间才读完的。《你当像鸟飞往你的山》是一本回忆录，讲的是一个17岁之前都是家里面上课的，然后考上大学接受教育的故事，确实会感慨，原生家庭对人的影响巨大，作者花了大量的时间走出来原生家庭的阴影。\n\n\n另外还买了很多书，很多只是开了一个头，还有很多还没看完的。接下来一年要认真看书，把书都看完了，不然堆积的书越来越多了，还有一些读了，但不在这里记录了，比如马斯克韦伯的《经济与社会》就还没读完。\n\n\n今年的疫情真的改变了很多东西。下半年，疫情开始渐渐好转，航空业承压，推出了随心飞，我买了东航的随心飞，所以2020年坐飞机还比较多。先去了成都，没想到一趟来回就回本了。国庆，去了甘肃和江西参加了同学的婚礼，也终于，没结婚的朋友又少了几个。有时候也会想，我的出路会在哪里呢？所追寻的答案，依然是一个虚无缥缈的东西。\n\n\n所幸，2020年，我终于找了我所爱的人，一个可可爱爱的姑娘，一切都是我喜欢的模样，人生所有的追寻，也许经历过的所有一切都只是为了这一刻的相遇。有时候会止不住地想她在做什么。第一见面的时候，是约了电影《金刚川》，刚好那几天在上映，但我第一次去竟然就迟到了，特别糗，但是没想到意外的很和谐，究竟是因为她擅长聊天，还是因为那天聊的都是我擅长的话题，也许并不重要了，重要的是，现在能在一起了。还有一件很糗的事就是，吃饭的时候一定要等把东西咽下去，再说话，“嗯”。\n\n\n2020年，写过的诗很少，产量严重下降，突然失去了很多写诗的灵感，要么之前写过了，要么就是写的不好，始终组不成句子。这里记录一下，我觉得还可以的几首。\n其中《浓夜挑灯（修改其一）》里面，我最喜欢的是“春风不与秋解衣”，其他几句更像是拿来凑数的。\n\n\n> 花行\n断柳残红孤映月，落雨停思人烟瘦。\n千里疾行花寻色，多情空等绿枝头。\n\n\n>浓夜挑灯（修改其一）\n风歌独娱云卧醉，挑灯揽窗夜无浓。\n春风不与秋解衣，过山趟客影稀零。\n\n\n>小梦起雨（修改其一）\n画舞披月色，婀娜映湖树。\n小梦云游处，相思落惊雨。\n\n\n时光荏苒，白驹过隙，时间真的是自顾自的一往无前，也不在乎后面的人是否能够追的上，咆哮着一路疾驰，转眼间2020年就结束了，仔细想想这一年的经历，想起一句话，身处历史中的人们并不知道自己是身处其中的，因为他们就是历史的一部分。此刻的我们，就是在经历历史，也在见证历史，发生历史。\n\n\n在2020年年末，有两件事要提及一下，一个是B站的晚会，新认识了五条人乐队，《世界的理想》，好喜欢这首歌，也好喜欢这次的晚会特效，特别好奇到底是如何做到的，也是厉害的很。还有裘继戎的《惊·鸿》舞蹈，串起来了现代和传统，特别的惊艳。当下的年轻人又有多少是喜欢戏曲的？老掉牙？古板？时代确实变了，很多东西都不再和之前一样流行了。反叛，永远是年轻的主题。不要用刻板的思路和教条去思考这个世界。在《十三邀》采访张亚东的一期中，因为他的母亲是晋剧演员，所以张亚东从小就学过晋剧，这一期中张亚东就提到晋剧的没落，已经很难被现代化改良了。这就是传统艺术的窘境，是否能在当下找到自己的语境就变成了生存之道，也许永远都找不到呢？\n\n\n还有一件就是，罗振宇的时间的朋友的演讲，一是里面有提到一句，政府“解决问题可以没有边界，但是给资源，那是有边界的”，我想这就是现在国内经济快速回暖的原因之一吧，想想年初的时候，一片哀嚎遍野，谁能想到下半年迅速企稳。还有一句是，“数字化对你来说是蜜糖还是毒药，只取决于你是对人负责，还是对事负责。”，当然这句话，我没有全部认同，但是显而易见的事实是，现在很多岗位正在逐渐被取代掉，世界正在更加快速地发展中，唯有不停的学习，不断的进步，才能跟上这个时代。\n\n\n也是这一年的突然暂停，让我产生了一个疑问，那就是这个时代还能接受田园牧歌吗？快与慢真的是二元对立的吗？因为时代的关系，总被逼着往前走，否则就是那个被淘汰的人。接受被淘汰，是否真的需要很大的勇气？在快中找到自己心里的绿洲，可以随时按下暂停键，也就变成了一个期望，也可能只是单纯的美好期望。\n\n犹记得多年前，问过别人一个问题，读书有什么用。那正是人生最迷茫的时候，一切都无从回答答案，一切都不知道该从何说起。当时得到的建议是，如果你不知道读书是为了什么，那就放下执念，就把读书当成一件功利的事情来看待，可以涨薪，可以撩妹，可以炫耀。现在再回头来看，读书有什么用，我想我可以回答自己了，那就是读书并没有什么用，只是让自己相比较没读书的时候，多了更多的充实的时光。感谢这一年的暂停，也感谢这美好的岁月，终究不会是完全错付。虽然并不都是读书带来的思考，但也让自己明白了，选择本身也是一种答案。\n\n写到最后，记一个教训。不要总觉得简单就不去做，很多技能是会渐渐遗忘和生疏的，哪怕是最简单的东西，只要不使用就是会被遗忘的。在接下来，自己也该明白，是时候捡起荒废已久的技能来了，不然在荒草丛生的岁月中，很难前行的。\n\n今天也就是2021年1月4号，《海贼王》正式发布了第1000话漫画，所以今天也是幸福的一天，也是值得纪念的一天。在《十三邀》采访罗翔那一期中，提到一个词，消极道德主义，也即道德是自律的，而不是他律的。希望更多人意识到这句话，也希望自己可以做到。愿2020年，能够心想事成吧。也祝愿2020年LOVE&PEACE。\n","slug":"戛然而止的2020年","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.504Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vksm004vpmnk0xs489vz","content":"<p>该怀着何种的心情来看待2020年呢？真的想了好久都想不到一个具体的词。因为2020年有着太多的回忆可以书写纪念了。于我而言，可以用一个词来形容，那就是戛然而止。以下都是写给自己的怀念，一不小心写了四千六百多字。\n<span

画舞披月色，婀娜映湖树。\n小梦云游处，相思落惊雨。</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>时光荏苒，白驹过隙，时间真的是自顾自的一往无前，也不在乎后面的人是否能够追的上，咆哮着一路疾驰，转眼间2020年就结束了，仔细想想这一年的经历，想起一句话，身处历史中的人们并不知道自己是身处其中的，因为他们就是历史的一部分。此刻的我们，就是在经历历史，也在见证历史，发生历史。</p>\n<p>在2020年年末，有两件事要提及一下，一个是B站的晚会，新认识了五条人乐队，《世界的理想》，好喜欢这首歌，也好喜欢这次的晚会特效，特别好奇到底是如何做到的，也是厉害的很。还有裘继戎的《惊·鸿》舞蹈，串起来了现代和传统，特别的惊艳。当下的年轻人又有多少是喜欢戏曲的？老掉牙？古板？时代确实变了，很多东西都不再和之前一样流行了。反叛，永远是年轻的主题。不要用刻板的思路和教条去思考这个世界。在《十三邀》采访张亚东的一期中，因为他的母亲是晋剧演员，所以张亚东从小就学过晋剧，这一期中张亚东就提到晋剧的没落，已经很难被现代化改良了。这就是传统艺术的窘境，是否能在当下找到自己的语境就变成了生存之道，也许永远都找不到呢？</p>\n<p>还有一件就是，罗振宇的时间的朋友的演讲，一是里面有提到一句，政府“解决问题可以没有边界，但是给资源，那是有边界的”，我想这就是现在国内经济快速回暖的原因之一吧，想想年初的时候，一片哀嚎遍野，谁能想到下半年迅速企稳。还有一句是，“数字化对你来说是蜜糖还是毒药，只取决于你是对人负责，还是对事负责。”，当然这句话，我没有全部认同，但是显而易见的事实是，现在很多岗位正在逐渐被取代掉，世界正在更加快速地发展中，唯有不停的学习，不断的进步，才能跟上这个时代。</p>\n<p>也是这一年的突然暂停，让我产生了一个疑问，那就是这个时代还能接受田园牧歌吗？快与慢真的是二元对立的吗？因为时代的关系，总被逼着往前走，否则就是那个被淘汰的人。接受被淘汰，是否真的需要很大的勇气？在快中找到自己心里的绿洲，可以随时按下暂停键，也就变成了一个期望，也可能只是单纯的美好期望。</p>\n<p>犹记得多年前，问过别人一个问题，读书有什么用。那正是人生最迷茫的时候，一切都无从回答答案，一切都不知道该从何说起。当时得到的建议是，如果你不知道读书是为了什么，那就放下执念，就把读书当成一件功利的事情来看待，可以涨薪，可以撩妹，可以炫耀。现在再回头来看，读书有什么用，我想我可以回答自己了，那就是读书并没有什么用，只是让自己相比较没读书的时候，多了更多的充实的时光。感谢这一年的暂停，也感谢这美好的岁月，终究不会是完全错付。虽然并不都是读书带来的思考，但也让自己明白了，选择本身也是一种答案。</p>\n<p>写到最后，记一个教训。不要总觉得简单就不去做，很多技能是会渐渐遗忘和生疏的，哪怕是最简单的东西，只要不使用就是会被遗忘的。在接下来，自己也该明白，是时候捡起荒废已久的技能来了，不然在荒草丛生的岁月中，很难前行的。</p>\n<p>今天也就是2021年1月4号，《海贼王》正式发布了第1000话漫画，所以今天也是幸福的一天，也是值得纪念的一天。在《十三邀》采访罗翔那一期中，提到一个词，消极道德主义，也即道德是自律的，而不是他律的。希望更多人意识到这句话，也希望自己可以做到。愿2020年，能够心想事成吧。也祝愿2020年LOVE&amp;PEACE。</p>\n","related_posts":[],"length":4120,"excerpt":"<p>该怀着何种的心情来看待2020年呢？真的想了好久都想不到一个具体的词。因为2020年有着太多的回忆可以书写纪念了。于我而言，可以用一个词来形容，那就是戛然而止。以下都是写给自己的怀念，一不小心写了四千六百多字。","more":"</p>\n<p>年初，当在网上出现SARS的零星报道时，想着也没什么吧，毕竟当年SARS出现的时候，我还很小，完全没有任何记忆，但是谁也没想到这次突然变成了很长时间的封锁。我也是后来查资料才知道，当年山西是一个重灾区。本来还想着绕道北京去回家，最后选择了直接买机票回去。还有本来准备春节后去四川参加同学的婚礼，也不得不取消掉了。于是，整个上半年突然就变成了戛然而止。关于疫情，有着太多太多的事迹可以书写了。但，当时代的尘埃落在一个个人的头上时，就是生死决别了。</p>\n<p>于我个人而言，我自己获得了难得的喘息机会，因为之前给自己弄了太多的压力，一时之间突然可以停下来思考一下自己到底想要什么，想要如何行走，反而也许是一件庆幸的事情。一切的一切都有着需要停下来思考的必要。</p>\n<p>上半年，因为封锁，厨艺有了进步，学了一些新的菜，也能成功分清楚很多蔬菜的名字了，成功把自己喂胖了很多，直到最近才又开始减下来。就也算是学到了一项新的技能，还有很多自己还不会做的，就留给以后的自己打磨吧。</p>\n<p>整个2020年，看了两百多部番剧和电影，有很多非常棒的作品，真的非常优秀，里面带着大量的思考和表达，每一代人都有着相同的迷惘和思考，其中最多的问题就是如何活下去，怎样活下去。每一代人也都有着不一样的困境，面对着不一样的具体问题，但是如何活下去却是贯穿在整个历史长河中的过程。</p>\n<p>《吹响悠风号》里高中少女在青春的上低音号。《极速车王》里对自己执着的坚持。《何以为家》里战乱弱国下的孩童的生存。《凪的新生活》中为了追求真实的自己付出的行动。《乔乔的异想世界》和《帝国的毁灭》中对于疯狂不一样的视角。《理查德·朱维尔的哀歌》根据现实改编的事件。《卡拉是条狗》中对现实的隐喻。《钢琴家》中，人间地狱，满目疮痍，活着就是一种幸运了。《牯岭街少年杀人事件》和《一秒钟》中时代的映照。《隐秘的角落》中恶的距离。《恋恋笔记本》和《花与爱丽丝》中兜兜转转的爱。《菊次郎的夏天》中菊次郎的成长。《八佰》中纵身一跳，家国难两全。《妙先生》和《姜子牙》中的善恶抉择。《雾山五行》、《一人之下》等一系列国漫的崛起。《人工智能》、《幸福终点站》、《遗愿清单》、《绿里奇迹》、《穿条纹睡衣的男孩》、《阳光灿烂的日子》等老片所带来的经典回味。《汉密尔顿》、《迷墙》等音乐带来的魅力。有着太多太多的的优秀作品可以拿来仔细品味了。即便如此，我也还有巨长的看片清单还没看完。</p>\n<p>当停下来的时候，仔细想想，这个世界有答案吗？我们总是试图去解释自己，试图去解释这个世界，可是很多时候，这个世界并没有答案。很多时候得到的答案，都是我们自己希望得到的答案，这个世界也许并不在乎。可是即便如此，我们依然需要寻找自己的答案，自己内心的答案究竟在什么地方，也许就在身边，也许还需要去远方寻找。</p>\n<p>2020年，对自己的包容心，又有了新的认知。我想，这就是所谓的阅历吧，随着阅历的增加，对事物的理解也开始有了更多不一样的内容，也越来越不会被无关的东西困扰了，也能分的了孰轻孰重。要说起来，2019年，是自己脾气见涨的一年，那么2020年就是趋于缓和的一年，重新开始包容理解，而不是之前的同情和赐予。</p>\n<p>2020年很惭愧，读的书很少，一部分原因是因为有些书真的难读，需要花费很多时间，另一部分原因还是自己心态的调节问题，自己去理解东西比别人塞给你东西，还是要难坚持一些。其中有一些和社会学相关的书，仔细思考之后发现，自己只是喜欢社会学中关于一些现象的解读，而不是喜欢整个社会学学科，也不会打算深入去研究社会学，获取见解观点对我来说已经足够了。毕竟作为一整个社会学学科来说，真的有太多的东西要去学习和理解。在这里重点说几本我读过的书。</p>\n<p>《资本主义的未来》，本来对这本书没报什么期待，毕竟是对西方世界的思考，但是读完作者对当下社会的思考之后，的确深感佩服，也会发现，中国也开始有一些这些问题的影子了。当下的社会的主要问题有，民粹主义和意识形态分子的问题。我想，尤其关注过美国大选和香港问题的人，对这些有更多的深刻印象。简单的道德确定性和对立的二元关系，非黑即白，造就了当下的社会环境，不管是国内还是国外，尤其我们现在身处的互联网时代，信息茧房带来的封闭环境，问题尤其明显，稍微出圈一点点，就会发现有大量的网络暴力存在。相关的案例有很多，这里不做表述。这就是我们现在的社会现实，书中关于这一点也提出了很多自己的解决之道。其中有一条就是，构建新的共同身份的认同。可是和而不同这句话，老祖宗很早就留给我们了，但是新的问题依然出现，依然需要很多的努力。</p>\n<p>这就涉及到第二本书了《现实的社会构建》，这是一本社会学入门的书，讲了很多基础社会学要素。有几个很关键的观点，其中提到，知识社会的分析对象就是现实的社会构建，社会的传统是会被继承的，但是同时又存在代际间的差异。很多习惯并非是明文规定的，或者对生存真的有帮助的东西，但是会被传承下去，仅仅是因为这种模式被惯例化了下来。也有的会因为代际传承的太多，导致出现了变异，比如你和你爷爷一辈的习惯可能完全不一样，也许仅仅是因为权威的被打破与生存无关。里面讲了很多在社会的构建过程中，会出现的问题和原因。对于理解社会学来说，真的很有帮助。</p>\n<p>还有一本书是《当代中国社会分层》，总听到一句话，当下的中国社会在渐渐地阶层固化中，但是这个问题到底有多严重，这本书提供了一些数据上的支持。整体而言，我们的国家并不是一个纺锤形的社会阶层，更像是哑铃形的，就是中间阶层比较少，穷人比较多的一个样子。2020年，是国家全面脱贫的一年，虽然书上的数据很多是五六年前的数据了，但是依然对我们在现实中思考中国的时候提供了很多参考。比如里面有提到，在当前中国的场景下，决定社会地位的因素。第一，权力地位。第二，经济地位。第三，教育地位。第四，技术职称。第五，户籍身份地位。第六，家庭出身。这些也恐怕依然是现实。</p>\n<p>对于小说，读完了《魔山》《你当像鸟飞往你的山》《人间失格》等，这几本书都很有意思。《魔山》中提到了大量的历史主义，现实主义等等的辩论，对于那个20世纪上半叶来说，真的是很出色的作品，就是有些难读，花了蛮长时间才读完的。《你当像鸟飞往你的山》是一本回忆录，讲的是一个17岁之前都是家里面上课的，然后考上大学接受教育的故事，确实会感慨，原生家庭对人的影响巨大，作者花了大量的时间走出来原生家庭的阴影。</p>\n<p>另外还买了很多书，很多只是开了一个头，还有很多还没看完的。接下来一年要认真看书，把书都看完了，不然堆积的书越来越多了，还有一些读了，但不在这里记录了，比如马斯克韦伯的《经济与社会》就还没读完。</p>\n<p>今年的疫情真的改变了很多东西。下半年，疫情开始渐渐好转，航空业承压，推出了随心飞，我买了东航的随心飞，所以2020年坐飞机还比较多。先去了成都，没想到一趟来回就回本了。国庆，去了甘肃和江西参加了同学的婚礼，也终于，没结婚的朋友又少了几个。有时候也会想，我的出路会在哪里呢？所追寻的答案，依然是一个虚无缥缈的东西。</p>\n<p>所幸，2020年，我终于找了我所爱的人，一个可可爱爱的姑娘，一切都是我喜欢的模样，人生所有的追寻，也许经历过的所有一切都只是为了这一刻的相遇。有时候会止不住地想她在做什么。第一见面的时候，是约了电影《金刚川》，刚好那几天在上映，但我第一次去竟然就迟到了，特别糗，但是没想到意外的很和谐，究竟是因为她擅长聊天，还是因为那天聊的都是我擅长的话题，也许并不重要了，重要的是，现在能在一起了。还有一件很糗的事就是，吃饭的时候一定要等把东西咽下去，再说话，“嗯”。</p>\n<p>2020年，写过的诗很少，产量严重下降，突然失去了很多写诗的灵感，要么之前写过了，要么就是写的不好，始终组不成句子。这里记录一下，我觉得还可以的几首。\n其中《浓夜挑灯（修改其一）》里面，我最喜欢的是“春风不与秋解衣”，其他几句更像是拿来凑数的。</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>花行

\n虽然，生活很多时候并不见得会一直向好。可人活着，总是想要乐观的活着的，不然那也活的太累了。可总感觉，时间好像对我而言少了很多，也许真的是年纪大了，也开始爱回忆过去了，不再有矫情的顾影自怜了，也不再有长夜的漫漫哀叹了，有的只是生活的不断忙碌和各种繁琐，有的只是日落月升的平凡时光，有的只是和爱人的时影相随。\n\n2021年，只有年初的时候读了几本书，比如：《对空言说：传播的观念史》，讲的关于媒体中的传播和交流在观念上的改变和变迁，交流的意义在当下的时代里面依然具有很重要的位置，即便有着各种各样的偏差和误解，即便有着各种各样的异化和隐藏，交流，尤其是现身交流依然有着无可比拟的重要性。\n\n《刘擎：西方现代思想讲义》，系统的讲解了从韦伯、黑格尔时代，一直到现代的迈克尔·沃尔泽、查尔斯·泰勒、西弗朗斯·福山、罗伯特·诺齐克等等各种各样的观点，这些构建了我们现代思想的大家们的思考和观点，各种批判，都构成了我们现代社会的一个个的个体。比如不同版本的“社会契约论”，关于政治权威的依据理由。这些都帮助我自己来更好的思考这个时代，思考我们存在的意义，思考社会上的一件件普普通通的事件，强烈推荐这本书。\n\n比如，死亡和贪欲，精神分析学，“可证伪”，萨特的自由选择与积极行动，存在主义哲学，视角主义，“恶的平庸性”，“证伪主义”理论，科学的“可证伪性”和“可证实性”，“整体主义”，“自发秩序”，以赛亚·柏林的价值多元论与“两种自由”的理论，“消极自由”和“积极自由”，赫伯特·马尔库塞的“虚假的需求”，被消费主义带起来的伪需求，“劳动异化”，无知之幕，“自由至上论”，诺奇克的“持有的正义”，“平等的关怀”，桑德尔提出的“构成性的社群”，西弗朗斯·福山的“历史终结论”，塞缪尔·亨廷顿的“文明冲突论”。\n\n人类因为理性而伟大，因为知道理性的局限而成熟。\n\n比如说，齐格门·鲍曼通过《现代性和大屠杀》拿来批判纳粹，让我们时刻坚守，我们是一个人，对面的也是一个人，这条最基本的底线，又有多少人能做到呢？大量的讨论和争辩，最后都变成了党同伐异，完全忘记了对面那个人也是一个真实存在的人。\n\n想想年初江歌案的判决，江歌受到了多少无耻的污蔑啊，江歌的妈妈选择拿起法律的武器，终究让这一部分人受到了应有的惩罚，隔着网线，我们少了很多真实的距离，原本以为可以随意的说话，可是想没想过这些话，这些话你自己真的能为其负责吗？\n\n比如最近的刘学州事件，刘学州选择了自杀，一个少年，扛过了无数的磨难，只想安安静静的上个学，有个活下去的理由，被亲生父母卖掉，养父母出了事故过世，从此在这个世界没了依靠，全靠爷爷奶奶活着。好不容易找到了亲生父母，以为生活会变好，可是亲生父母不要他，污蔑抹黑他，不想负责，怕他赖上自己，只想拿他为自己赚个好名声。然后还被网暴谩骂。终于扛不住，选择了自杀。\n \n2021年，还看了《看不见的城市》，这是一本卡尔维诺很经典的书，很久之前看了一半，2021年终于看完了，虚构了一个忽必烈和马可波罗的很多对话，讲了很多城市的故事，一个是征服者和一个旅行者的故事，很有意思。《敞开 : 人与动物》是南京大学出版社弄得一个翻译最近的一些新的哲学思想的一个系列，这是其中一本，不适合我，讲了人和动物的区别，作者提了很多自己的思观点和思考过程。我还看了《红与黑》，司汤达的小说，讲小人物爬上去又迷失的故事。\n\n我把毛主席的《论持久战》看了一遍，不得不说主席的远见，关于当时的战争形势和战争态势和敌我双方的判断，从现在事后的我们来看，真的很准确，难怪能走到最后。还有《战天京 : 晚清军政传信录》，作者谭伯牛，讲了晚清时期曾国藩带兵灭掉太平天国的事情，写的很生动，从中也可以看出晚清的一滩烂泥，已经深入骨髓了，无力挽救了。还有《中国的经济制度 : 中国经济改革三十年》，作者张五常，主要的观点就是认为，过往的经济发展主要得益于县际竞争。还有《一切且有可能》，一本畅销小说，文笔不错，是个半自传性质的。\n\n还有一些看了一半的书，大概率懒得再去看另一半了。《合作的进化》讲囚徒困境的。《下沉年代》，讲美国的一些社会变迁的。《参与胜利》，讲网络时代的参与文化。\n\n2021年，一共看了161部影视作品。记录下，比较好看的一些，比如《76天》，讲武汉封城期间的故事。《约定的梦幻岛第二季》，大烂尾。《沉默的真相》、《扎克·施奈德版正义联盟》、《刺杀小说家》、《岸边露伴一动不动》、《悬崖之上》。《魁拔之殊途》，不得不说，魁拔只能是粉丝向的东西了，这画风，真的很难吸引更广大的受众来看了。《大明劫》讲的是明末孙传庭被贬潼关，遇到瘟疫，吴又可帮助消灭瘟疫，并写了《温疫论》的故事。故事的结尾，因为李自成，朝廷告急，又重新启用孙传庭，为了尽快启程，临走之前，把所有带不走的患病士兵都杀了，可惜战败，从此明朝再没有可一战的兵力。里面有一个故事很深刻，孙传庭需要用兵，需要钱粮，就找当地的地主们借，没一个借的，明朝的兼并已经到了这种程度。\n\n还有《活死人军团》，这都拍了些啥啊，真的从此对扎克·施奈德毫不期待。还有《酒精计划》这片都能拿奥斯卡外语奖，是我没想到的。还有《困在时间里的父亲》，年华易老啊。《花束的恋爱》，菅田将晖和有村架纯谈恋爱，从有趣到平淡，再到结束，这是多少人的恋爱的故事。有一个细节，男主和女主，之前都喜欢《黄金神威》，但后面男主忙于生活就再也不知道后面的剧情，可是女主还是一直在追。我也喜欢《黄金神威》。还有《长津湖》和《冰雪长津湖》，那么艰难的环境都能赢，前辈们真的很不容易。还有《浪客剑心》、《星之梦》、《回忆三部曲》、《一直游到海水变蓝》、《千里走单骑》、《JOJO的奇妙冒险 石之海》、《平家物语》、《漂流少年》、《鱿鱼游戏》、《紫罗兰永恒花园 剧场版》、《吉祥如意》等等。《成瘾剂量》尤其深刻的是，鸦片类药物的成瘾性和资本的险恶，一个剂量不够那就再来更多，直到深深上瘾，自己却不受任何的处罚，简直了。还有《不要抬头》，真的把当下美国社会黑了一个遍，可是，然后呢？好像并没有看到他们有新的动作，美国的社会依然在大分裂。尤其是，哈利波特二十周年纪念版里面居然没有J.K.罗琳，简直离了大谱，尤其还是因为J.K.罗琳发表的关于各种什么性别的话题，难道她说的有错吗？这样的话，女性的权益不就是会被侵害到吗？你不能因为你自己宣称你自己是女性，你就可以是女的，再怎么变化，也要尊重物理规律。至于说把男性，女性标签化，这就是另一个话题了，性别，不该是对立和矛盾的存在。\n\n2021年，一共离开上海两次，两次都是回家，一次是过年，一次是带我女朋友回去，现在出行真的很少了，也好久没有出去旅行了，不知道什么时候才能够正常啊，可以正常旅行，可以正常出去。\n\n2021年，各种展也很少去看了，只在网上看了《一个无政府主义者的死亡》的官摄，还有马克夏加尔和莫奈的画展，就这些了。\n\n2021年，才子赵英俊过世了，有非常多的很不错的歌是他写的。袁隆平过世，愿袁爷爷好好休息。《剑风传奇》的作者三浦建太郎过世了，再也等不到漫画完结了。人生也终于是遗憾的。\n\n2021年，新垣结衣嫁给了星野源，菅田将晖也结婚了，啥时候到我自己呢？\n\n于是，2021年就这样结束了，发生了很多事，但依然超快速的结束了，也只能去期待下一年了。媒体的客观性在大量的消失，我在看一部作品之前一定会先看下评价如何，不会再为垃圾作品浪费时间了。一年里，也没有写任何的诗，文章也写的很少了。可依然感觉自己没什么时间。厨艺见长，做的也越来好吃了。手上的钱却也不见得增加的足够多。微信公众号的推荐流里面，长文越来越少，我也没那么多耐心都看一本书了，只想快速的获取信息，然后结束。\n\n接下来，要开始准备写毕业论文，学习新的知识，学好多好多东西，希望能有一颗平静的心。工作量又增加了，忙碌的一年又要开始了。\n\n于是，只能怀着有一个已经存在过的期待走入下一个2021年了，美好祝愿。\n","source":"_posts/超快速的2021年.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

中国经济改革三十年》，作者张五常，主要的观点就是认为，过往的经济发展主要得益于县际竞争。还有《一切且有可能》，一本畅销小说，文笔不错，是个半自传性质的。\n\n还有一些看了一半的书，大概率懒得再去看另一半了。《合作的进化》讲囚徒困境的。《下沉年代》，讲美国的一些社会变迁的。《参与胜利》，讲网络时代的参与文化。\n\n2021年，一共看了161部影视作品。记录下，比较好看的一些，比如《76天》，讲武汉封城期间的故事。《约定的梦幻岛第二季》，大烂尾。《沉默的真相》、《扎克·施奈德版正义联盟》、《刺杀小说家》、《岸边露伴一动不动》、《悬崖之上》。《魁拔之殊途》，不得不说，魁拔只能是粉丝向的东西了，这画风，真的很难吸引更广大的受众来看了。《大明劫》讲的是明末孙传庭被贬潼关，遇到瘟疫，吴又可帮助消灭瘟疫，并写了《温疫论》的故事。故事的结尾，因为李自成，朝廷告急，又重新启用孙传庭，为了尽快启程，临走之前，把所有带不走的患病士兵都杀了，可惜战败，从此明朝再没有可一战的兵力。里面有一个故事很深刻，孙传庭需要用兵，需要钱粮，就找当地的地主们借，没一个借的，明朝的兼并已经到了这种程度。\n\n还有《活死人军团》，这都拍了些啥啊，真的从此对扎克·施奈德毫不期待。还有《酒精计划》这片都能拿奥斯卡外语奖，是我没想到的。还有《困在时间里的父亲》，年华易老啊。《花束的恋爱》，菅田将晖和有村架纯谈恋爱，从有趣到平淡，再到结束，这是多少人的恋爱的故事。有一个细节，男主和女主，之前都喜欢《黄金神威》，但后面男主忙于生活就再也不知道后面的剧情，可是女主还是一直在追。我也喜欢《黄金神威》。还有《长津湖》和《冰雪长津湖》，那么艰难的环境都能赢，前辈们真的很不容易。还有《浪客剑心》、《星之梦》、《回忆三部曲》、《一直游到海水变蓝》、《千里走单骑》、《JOJO的奇妙冒险 石之海》、《平家物语》、《漂流少年》、《鱿鱼游戏》、《紫罗兰永恒花园 剧场版》、《吉祥如意》等等。《成瘾剂量》尤其深刻的是，鸦片类药物的成瘾性和资本的险恶，一个剂量不够那就再来更多，直到深深上瘾，自己却不受任何的处罚，简直了。还有《不要抬头》，真的把当下美国社会黑了一个遍，可是，然后呢？好像并没有看到他们有新的动作，美国的社会依然在大分裂。尤其是，哈利波特二十周年纪念版里面居然没有J.K.罗琳，简直离了大谱，尤其还是因为J.K.罗琳发表的关于各种什么性别的话题，难道她说的有错吗？这样的话，女性的权益不就是会被侵害到吗？你不能因为你自己宣称你自己是女性，你就可以是女的，再怎么变化，也要尊重物理规律。至于说把男性，女性标签化，这就是另一个话题了，性别，不该是对立和矛盾的存在。\n\n2021年，一共离开上海两次，两次都是回家，一次是过年，一次是带我女朋友回去，现在出行真的很少了，也好久没有出去旅行了，不知道什么时候才能够正常啊，可以正常旅行，可以正常出去。\n\n2021年，各种展也很少去看了，只在网上看了《一个无政府主义者的死亡》的官摄，还有马克夏加尔和莫奈的画展，就这些了。\n\n2021年，才子赵英俊过世了，有非常多的很不错的歌是他写的。袁隆平过世，愿袁爷爷好好休息。《剑风传奇》的作者三浦建太郎过世了，再也等不到漫画完结了。人生也终于是遗憾的。\n\n2021年，新垣结衣嫁给了星野源，菅田将晖也结婚了，啥时候到我自己呢？\n\n于是，2021年就这样结束了，发生了很多事，但依然超快速的结束了，也只能去期待下一年了。媒体的客观性在大量的消失，我在看一部作品之前一定会先看下评价如何，不会再为垃圾作品浪费时间了。一年里，也没有写任何的诗，文章也写的很少了。可依然感觉自己没什么时间。厨艺见长，做的也越来好吃了。手上的钱却也不见得增加的足够多。微信公众号的推荐流里面，长文越来越少，我也没那么多耐心都看一本书了，只想快速的获取信息，然后结束。\n\n接下来，要开始准备写毕业论文，学习新的知识，学好多好多东西，希望能有一颗平静的心。工作量又增加了，忙碌的一年又要开始了。\n\n于是，只能怀着有一个已经存在过的期待走入下一个2021年了，美好祝愿。\n","slug":"超快速的2021年","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-14T07:04:39.811Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vkso005lpmnk44bu6c9j","content":"<p>2021年就这样结束了，再上一年的结束，感觉就在眨眼间，回头来看，疫情并没有消失，时不时就会出来闹腾一下，可见的未来，疫情并不会短期消失。\n<span

位置147\n此外，将行为视作一种功能的条件也被人们忽略了。对于好奇心，人们最终得出的往往是心理的解释。在日常交谈中，我们常常会看到这一点。如果我们问某人“你为什么要去看戏剧？”，他回答说“因为我想去”，我们很容易把他的回答当成一种解释。我们更应该了解的是他以前去看戏剧时曾发生过什么，他去看戏时曾听到或看到过什么，他过去或当前的环境中有哪些东西可能会促使他去看戏（而不是去做其他事情）。但实际上，我们往往会将“我想去”这三个字看成对上述这些问题的总结，而且很可能不会再去询问更多的细节。\n<!--more-->\n第一章行为技术 - 位置167\n内在人（innerman）的作用在于提供一种解释，但反过来，这种解释本身却不能获得解释。于是，解释便在他这里中止了。内在人不是过去经历和当前行为之间的中介，而是产生行为的中心。他的作用在于启动、开启、创造，这样一来，他便一直被覆盖着一层神秘的面纱，就像他在希腊人心目中的样子一样。因此，我们说，他是自主的——从行为科学的角度说，这意味着他是不可思议的。与之相似，还有外在人（outerman）的概念。\n\n第一章 行为技术 - 位置275\n科学是人类行为，与科学相对立的也是人类行为。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置317\n几乎所有生物的行为都是为了让自己摆脱有害的接触。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置325\n行为还有一个更为重要的作用，它能以另一种方式削弱有害的刺激。虽然它不是以条件反射的形式获得的，但却是一种不同的被称为操作性条件作用的过程的产物。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置341\n他们也可能是“有意”让人厌恶的——他们可能会为了某种结果而以让人厌恶的方式来对待他人。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置347\n厌恶性控制（aversivecontrol）\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置348\n如果有人以令人厌恶的方式对待一个人，直到这个人就范，那么，当这个人做出前者所要求的行为以逃开或避免这种令人厌恶的对待方式时，其结果就强化了前者的行为。不过，他也可以采用别的方式来逃避。另一种变相的逃避方式是攻击那些设置厌恶性条件的人，并削弱或摧毁他们的力量。\n\n第二章 自由- 位置362\n蓄意破坏和暴动骚乱常常是无明确指向对象或指向错误对象的攻击行为。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置391\n在约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒看来，“自由是指一个人能做他想做之事”。自由文献在改变实践的过程中发挥了重要的作用（无论是在什么时候，也无论它在其中发挥了怎样的作用，它都改变了实践），但它却把自己的任务确定为改变心理状态和情感状态。自由是一种“占有”（possession）。人逃避或摧毁控制者的权力是为了感受自由，而一旦他感受到了自由，能做自己想做之事后，自由文献除了提醒他要永远保持警惕以防控制者再次实施控制之外，或许再也推荐不了任何更进一步的行动，也指定不了什么东西了。\n\n第二章 自由  - 位置399\n工资则例证了另一种不同的原则：一个人若按某一特定的方式行事，他就会获得报酬，这样一来，他就会继续以那一特定的方式行事。尽管人们很早以前就已经认识到了奖赏所具有的有效作用，但工资制度的发展却非常缓慢。在19世纪，人们认为，工业社会需要一支饥饿的劳动力队伍。只有当饥饿的工人可以用工资来换取食物时，工资才能发挥实际的效用。如果减少工人对劳动的厌恶感——例如，缩短劳动时间，改善劳动条件——那么，即使报酬降低，也有可能让工人愿意劳动。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置412\n人们通常所说的条件性正强化物（conditioned positive reinforcer），使用后，往往会带来延迟的厌恶性结果。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置483\n还有一个例子是邀请囚犯自愿参加那些很可能有危险的实验——例如，新药物的实验。如果参加实验，囚犯便可以获得更好的生活条件或者减刑。如果囚犯是被迫参加实验的，那么，人人都将反对。但是，当囚犯受到正强化，尤其是当政府施行这种改善生活条件或缩短刑期的做法时，他们真的是自由的吗？\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置491\n自由文献中经常出现的两种观点清楚地表明了人们对于积极控制（positive control）的不确定态度。有人提出，虽然行为完全是被决定的，但一个人“感觉自由”或“认为他自己是自由的”总是要好一些。如果这意味着采取不会产生厌恶性结果的控制方式会更好一些，那我们或许会赞同；但如果这意味着采取不会招致任何人反抗的控制方式更好，那么，这种说法就没有考虑到存在延迟的厌恶性结果的可能性。第二种说法似乎更为恰当一些：“做一个意识清醒的奴隶（slave）比做一个快乐的奴隶好。”“奴隶”这个词澄清了我们正在思考的那些最终后果的实质：它们是剥削性的，因而是令人厌恶的。奴隶所能意识到的是他所经历的悲惨遭遇，而一种精心设计以致不会招来任何反抗的奴隶制度才是真正的威胁所在。自由文献意在让人们“意识到”这种厌恶性控制，但它所选择的方法却不能拯救快乐的奴隶。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置500\n尽管事实上一直是你 [教师]在控制孩子，但你也应该让 [孩子]相信，他一直是在他自己的掌控之中。没有任何形式的征服像保持表面上的自由那样完美，因为在这种征服中，你可以俘获意志本身。可怜的婴儿，一无所知，一无所能，一无所学，难道他不是任你摆布吗？难道你不能为他安排周围世界的一切吗？难道你不能随心所欲地影响他吗？他的学业和游戏、他的痛苦和快乐，难道不都在你的掌控之中而不为他所知吗？毫无疑问，他本应该只做他想做的事情；但他却只应该想做你想让他做的事情；他不应该迈出你没有预见到的步子；在你不知道他要说什么的时候，他就不应该开口。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置520\n如果不是因为有“一切控制都是错误的”这个毫无根据的概括，我们应该可以像处理非社会问题那样简单地解决社会环境的问题。虽然科技的发展已经让人们摆脱了环境所具有的一些厌恶性特征，但它并没有让人摆脱环境。我们承认我们依赖于周围世界这一事实，而我们要改变的仅仅只是这种依赖的性质。同样，要使社会环境尽可能地摆脱厌恶性刺激，我们并不需要去破坏环境或逃离环境，我们需要重新设计它。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置532\n任何表明一个人的行为可能由外界环境引起的证据，都似乎会对这个人的尊严或价值产生威胁。一个人的成就如果事实上是通过一些他无法控制的力量而取得的，那么，我们往往不会表扬他。我们可以在一定程度上容忍这样的证据，就像我们满不在乎地接受一些表明人并不自由的证据一样。当我们将艺术作品、文学作品、政治生涯、科学发现中的重要成就归因于艺术家、作家、政治家和科学家在各自的生活中所受到的“影响”时，没有谁会因此而感到非常困扰。但是，当行为分析提出的进一步证据表明，一个人之所以取得成就，几乎完全都是外界的原因，而没有他自身的原因时，这种证据及其所依据的科学便会遭到挑战。\n**自由是由于行为的厌恶性结果而引发的一个问题，而尊严（dignity）却与正强化有关。**\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置546\n我们往往会去强化那些强化我们的人，这可能是一种自然倾向，就像我们会攻击那些攻击我们的人一样。不过，相似的行为往往产生于许多不同的社会性相倚联系。我们之所以赞扬那些为我们的利益而工作的人，是因为他们继续那样做便会使我们得到强化。当我们因为某事赞扬某人，我们就确定出了一种额外的强化结果。我们表彰一个赢得比赛的人，是为了强调这样一个事实，即比赛的胜利有赖于他的行为，因此，胜利对他而言可能更具有强化作用。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置573\n我们之所以习惯于称赞那些过独身生活、将所属财产捐赠他人，或者在遭受迫害时仍忠于某项事业的人，是因为他们都有明确的理由可以做出不同的行为。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置576\n就像拉罗什富科所观察到的：“无论是谁，如果他的性格中没有为恶的力量，他的善就不值得称赞。除此之外，其他一切所谓的善都只不过是意志的懒散或软弱而已。”\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置578\n当行为明确受到刺激控制时，褒奖与行为原因的可见性之间的反比关系就表现得尤其明显。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置616\n我们通过让自己置身于通常只会引起无价值行为的条件，同时避免以无价值的方式行事，以此来夸大我们应得的褒奖。我们总是努力找出使行为获得正强化的那些条件，然后又拒绝做出那种行为；我们追求诱惑，就像在沙漠中行走的圣徒在附近安排美女和美食，借此将自己苦行生活的美德最大化。我们就像自行鞭笞者一样，在本可以住手时，却依然继续惩罚自己，或者，在本可以逃脱时，却依然屈从于殉道者的命运。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置656\n我们对于不理解的事物总是心生敬畏，因此，我们越不了解某个行为，就越可能羡慕它，这就不足为奇了。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置671\n我们所说的尊严之战与自由之战有许多共同的特征。移除一种正强化物是令人厌恶的，因此，当人们被剥夺奖赏、赞美或者受赞扬或赞美的机会时，他们也会产生相似的反应。他们会逃离那些剥夺他们的人，或者向其发起攻击，以削弱这些人的力量。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置711\n虽然从事危险、艰苦且令人痛苦的工作的人常常受人称赞，但几乎所有人都愿意放弃因做这些工作而获得的称赞。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置728\n我们因一个人的所作所为而给予他奖赏，意味着我们认识到了他的尊严或价值。而我们所给予的奖赏的量通常与他的行为原因的明显性成反比。如果我们不知道一个人为何会如此行事，那我们就会把他的行为归因于他自身。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置748\n惩罚一词通常仅限于由他人蓄意安排的相倚性，而他们之所以要安排这些相倚性，是因为由此产生的结果对他们而言具有强化作用。（我们注意不要将惩罚性相倚联系与厌恶性控制相混淆。厌恶性控制通常被用来引导人们以某些特定的方式行事，而惩罚性相倚联系则常被用来引导人们不以某些特定的方式行事。）\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置759\n惩罚被设计出来，是为了将那些难以处理的、危险的或者不适宜的行为从人的整个行为中清除出去。惩罚的设计基于这样一种假设，即一个人在受到惩罚之后，便不太可能再以同样的方式行事。但不幸的是，事情并非如此简单。奖励与惩罚的不同不仅仅表现在它们所引发之改变的方向上。一个曾因玩性游戏而遭受严厉惩罚的孩子，并不一定不会继续表现出这样的行为；一个曾因其暴行而锒铛入狱的人，也不一定在今后不再表现出暴力行为。被惩罚的行为在惩罚性相倚联系被撤销后，很可能会再次表现出来。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置768\n毫不夸张地说，受过惩罚的人在以后很可能会“为了逃避惩罚”而采取一些行为。他可能会为了避免受罚而采取不会受罚的行为方式，但也存在其他的可能性。其中有些逃避惩罚的方式是破坏性的、适应不良的或者神经症性的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置777\n或者将他人的行为解释为应该受罚，从而投射（projecting）他自己的倾向。他还可以合理化（rationalize）自己的行为，向自己或他人提供一大堆理由，从而使得本该受罚的行为成为不该受罚的行为——例如，他声称，他之所以打孩子，是为了孩子好。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置784\n一个经常因为易于动怒而受罚的人，在下一次动怒前可以先从一数到十。如果在数数的过程中，他做出攻击性行为的倾向降低到了可控的水平，那么，他就可以避免受到惩罚了。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置788\n惩罚性相倚联系还可以包括引导一个人去寻找或建构他在其中能够采取一些行为来取代受罚行为的环境。他会一天到晚忙着做一些不会受罚的事情，从而让自己远离麻烦，譬如坚持不懈地“做着其他一些事情”。（许多似乎不产生积极强化效果因而显得不合理的行为，可能具有取代受罚行为的作用。）个体甚至还可以采取措施来强化那些教导他不要做出受罚行为的相倚联系。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置795\n通过创造一些行为不易受罚的环境，人们便可以减少受罚行为。还有一种可以采取的策略是打破那些使得受罚行为得到强化的相倚联系。另一种策略是安排环境，使得行为在其中可以发生，但不会受到惩罚。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置854\n人们常常会告诉自己该做什么、不该做什么，但却往往忽略了这样一个事实，即他这样做，都是社会一直以来通过言语的方式教导他的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置874\n善就像尊严或价值的其他方面一样，会随着可见控制的减弱而增强。当然，自由同样也是如此。因此，善与自由往往密切相关。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置899\n一个人“打算怎么做”，通常取决于他过去做过的事情，以及在他做过这些事情之后所发生的事情。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置904\n**“只有自由的人才能为自己的行为负责”**，这一观点有两层含义，要看我们是对自由还是对责任感兴趣。如果我们想说人是负有责任的，那么我们就不能干涉他们的自由，因为如果他们没有行动的自由，他们就不能承担起责任。而如果我们想说人是自由的，那么我们就必须通过维持惩罚性相倚联系来促使他们为其行为负责，因为如果他们在明显不具有惩罚性的相倚联系下仍以同样的方式行事，那他们显然就是不自由的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置924\n我们无法通过增强责任感来解决酗酒和青少年犯罪的问题。该为不良行为“负责”的是环境，必须要改变的也是环境，而不是个体的某种特性。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置944\n酗酒者常常第一个声称自己生了病，而犯下了罪行的青少年则往往会说自己是不良环境的牺牲品。如果他们不用为自己的所作所为承担责任，那他们就不能受到公正的惩罚。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置948\n**但现在人们普遍认为，没有愚笨的学生，只有不会教的教师；没有不好的孩子，只有不好的父母；青少年犯罪都是执法机构造成的；没有懒惰的人，只有不恰当的激励制度。当然，我们必须反问一句：为什么错的总是教师、父母、政府官员和企业家？正如我们在后面将会看到的，这种观点的错误在于：它总想把责任推给某个人，而且总认为其中存在着某种因果关系。**\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置1007\n一个人不会因为受过惩罚而不再以某种特定的方式行事，他至多能学会如何逃避惩罚而已。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023\n放任自流（permissiveness）\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023\n目前，有人已经严肃认真地提出用一种彻头彻尾的放任自流的做法来取代惩罚。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1038\n助产士式的控制（the controller as midwife），一个人帮助另一个人“生出”行为。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1061\n如果我们对一本书的内容已经滚瓜烂熟，或者如果我们对这本书的内容一窍不通，那我们是不会碰这本书的。我们愿意阅读的，通常是那些能帮助我们说出我们想说但又不能靠自己说出来的内容的书籍。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1071\n行为是可以“培养”的。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1073\n教师不能教，他只能帮助学生学。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1074\n弗洛伊德认为，一个人的成长必须经历好几个发展阶段，\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1080\n不过，只有施加控制，指导才会有效。指导意味着要开辟新的机会，或者阻止行为朝某个特定的方向发展。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1089\n如果创造出一种环境，让人们在其中快速学会有效的行为，并持续有效地表现出这一行为，那无疑将很有价值。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1097\n依赖于事物而不是依赖于他人的做法，其优点之一在于可以节省他人的时间和精力。一个人应当依赖的“事物”中，还包括那些没有专为改变他的行为而采取行动的人。依赖于事物还有一个重要的优点，那就是：与他人安排的相倚联系相比，与事物有关的相倚联系通常更为精确，且能塑造更为有用的行为。 事物的世界可能是一个专断、暴虐的世界。依赖于事物并不等于独立。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1125\n一个人永远都不可能真正自立。即使他能有效地处理各种事情，他也必定依赖于那些曾经教他这样做的人。是这些人为他选定了他该依赖的事物，并决定了他依赖的形式和程度。（因此，他们不能推卸对结果所应承担的责任。）\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1137\n任何人都不会对提示、暗示、建议做出任何反应，除非他已经拥有某种以某一特定方式行事的倾向。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1140\n树立榜样也是在施加某种类似的控制，它利用了人们会模仿他人言行的一般性倾向。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1150\n只有在个体已经有了某种行动的倾向时，敦促和劝说才会产生效果，而且，只要这种倾向无法解释，我们就可以把他的行为归因于一个内在人。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1172\n我们可以改变一种行为发生的可能性，但我们改变不了需要。我们常以特定的方式来强化行为，但我们给不了一个人目的或意图。我们可以改变对待某物的行为，但改变不了对它的态度。我们可以抽取并改变言语行为，但改变不了观点。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1174\n改变思想的另一种方式，是指明一个人以某种特定方式行为的原因，而这些原因几乎都可能相倚于行为的结果。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1199\n像放任自流、助产术、指导、依赖于事物等方法一样，自由与尊严的捍卫者也对改变思想的方法持容忍的态度，因为它是一种不太有效的改变行为的方法，而且，改变思想者也可以因此而逃避指责，不让别人说他是在控制人。事情出错时，他也可以不用承担责任。这样，自主人就幸存了下来，他会因为所取得的成就受到褒奖，也会因为犯下的错误而受到指责。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1211\n只有存在可利用的其他形式的控制时，控制最少的政府才是最好的政府。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1213\n**自由经济并不意味着不要经济控制，这是因为，只要货物与金钱依然具有强化作用，经济就无自由可言。**\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1295\n通过说某物好或坏来进行价值判断，其实是根据这个物体的强化效果对其作一归类。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1388\n正如我们已经看到的，公正或公平的问题常常不过是一个善于管理资源的问题。这个问题在于强化物是否得到了明智的运用。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1428\n任何规则或法律都包含一条有关普遍相倚联系（可能是自然的相倚联系，也可能是社会性的相倚联系）的陈述。\n\n第六章 价值  - 位置1431\n建筑工人戴上安全帽，从而遵守了一条规则。这里的自然相倚联系（涉及保护建筑工人不被下落物击中头部）并不十分有效，因而必须强制实施另一条规则：如果有建筑工人不戴安全帽，他就将被解雇。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1450\n教育领域也是如此：非正式群体的成员通常在有意或无意指导之下相互学习，而有组织的教育则会雇用被我们称为教师的专家，让他们在特定的地方（即我们所说的学校）通过安排与特定强化物（如成绩、文凭）相关的相倚联系来进行教育。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1484\n减少冲突，使用更为有力的强化物，增强相倚联系的作用，从而加强原初的控制。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1488\n如果学生不学习，那不是因为他们对学习不感兴趣，而是因为学习标准太低，或者是因为所学的课程与一种让人满意的生活早已没有任何关联。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1496\n第一步要做的是：确定一个人在为他人利益效力而受到控制时所能获得的利益有哪些。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1528\n人作为一种社会性动物拥有一种优势，那就是：不需要亲自去发现所有的实践活动。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1537\n人作为一种社会性动物还有另外一个优势：每一个个体归根结底都是“他人”中的一员，都会实施控制，而且，他们都是为了自己的利益而实施控制的。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1590\n人类学家经常强调，应该用这种能容忍不同观点的相对论来替代宗教狂热，因为宗教狂热力图将所有的文化都转化为一套单一的伦理、政府、宗教或经济方面的价值。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1629\n**文化是一套习俗体系，但不是一套不可与其他习俗体系相融合的体系。**\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1657\n物种和文化首先要面对的都是与自然环境的“竞争”。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1674\n而一个人对自己文化之生存的感受，则取决于该文化采用什么样的手段来诱使其成员为其生存而效力。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1695\n生存是我们最终评价一种文化的唯一价值，从定义上看，任何能促进生存的习俗都具有生存价值。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1721\n文化的演进是“进步”吗？它的目标是什么？它的目标是产生一种与那些诱使个体为其文化之生存而努力的结果。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1765\n我们说某些文化尚未充分发展或不成熟，那是相对于我们所说的其他“先进”文化而言的。但是，如果有人说有哪种政府、宗教或经济制度是成熟的制度，那么，这实际上是一种低级的沙文主义。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置1860\n通过改变行为发挥作用的条件，便可以改变行为。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置1933\n失败并不总是错误，它或许只是一个人在当时的情形之下所能做出的最好选择。其实真正的错误是停止尝试。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置2037\n这个世界之所以会被喜欢，是因为人们所接受的教育要求他们要喜欢它，而至于为什么要喜欢，则并非总有人去做细细的审查。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置2186\n生存价值会随着环境的改变而改变。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2277\n一个人的行为在某种程度上应归因于先前的事件，而且相比于人自身，环境更可能对人的行为产生影响。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2357\n**有人说，人之所以有别于其他动物，主要是因为他能“意识到他自己的存在”。**\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2456\n这个问题在神学中占有奇妙的地位。人是因为邪恶才犯罪，还是因为犯了罪才邪恶？事实上，这两种问法都不能说明任何有用的东西。说一个人是因为犯了罪才邪恶，其实是给犯罪下了一个操作性定义。而说一个人是因为邪恶才犯罪，也只不过是把他的行为归咎到了一种假想的内在特性上。但是，一个人是否会做出那种被称为犯罪的行为，通常取决于上述两种问法都没有提及的环境条件。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2475\n自我就是一整套与某一既定系列的相倚联系相适应的行为。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2568\n人自身可能会受到周围环境的控制，但周围的环境几乎全部都是由他自己创造的。大多数人的物质环境基本上都是人造的。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2595\n人所造就的人，其实是人所设计之文化的产物。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2615\n甚至在组织最为严密的文化中，每一个人的经历也都是独特的。任何有意设计的文化都不能消除这种独特性，而且正如我们已经看到的，任何旨在消除独特性的努力都是糟糕的设计。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2622\n**个人主义（individualism）面临的最大问题是死亡——它是个体无法逃避的命运，是对自由和尊严的致命打击。**\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2656\n再有一种影响就是怀旧感（nostalgia）。当人们抓住并夸大了现在与过去之间的相似之处时，旧有的技能便会涌现出来。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2661\n任何事物都不会因为我们审视它、谈论它或以一种新的方式分析它而有所改变。\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2690\n一种新理论可以改变的只不过是我们对其研究对象所做的事情。一种关于人的科学观点提供了各种让人兴奋的可能性。我们至今尚未看到人到底将人造就成了什么样子。\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2809\n当我们让某人喝一两杯酒从而让他高兴起来，或者当他自己喝了点酒或抽了点大麻从而“减少了他内在世界的厌恶性特征”时，他的感受似乎发生了改变。但是，真正发生改变的不是感受，而是所感觉到的身体状态。一种文化的设计者往往会改变伴随与环境相关之行为的感受，而且，他通常是通过改变环境做到这一点的。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2884\n由于传递模式的不同，“一代人”在生物进化和文化演进过程中的含义往往会有很大的差异。在文化演进过程中，它只不过是一个衡量时间的尺度。仅在一代人的身上，文化方面的变化（“变异”）就有可能出现，而且可能会被传递很多次。\n","source":"_posts/超越自由与尊严.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 《超越自由与尊严》摘录\ntags: 随笔\ncomments: false\ncategories: 随笔\ndate: 2020-04-20 17:23:41\n---\n第一章 行为技术 - 位置147\n此外，将行为视作一种功能的条件也被人们忽略了。对于好奇心，人们最终得出的往往是心理的解释。在日常交谈中，我们常常会看到这一点。如果我们问某人“你为什么要去看戏剧？”，他回答说“因为我想去”，我们很容易把他的回答当成一种解释。我们更应该了解的是他以前去看戏剧时曾发生过什么，他去看戏时曾听到或看到过什么，他过去或当前的环境中有哪些东西可能会促使他去看戏（而不是去做其他事情）。但实际上，我们往往会将“我想去”这三个字看成对上述这些问题的总结，而且很可能不会再去询问更多的细节。\n<!--more-->\n第一章行为技术 - 位置167\n内在人（innerman）的作用在于提供一种解释，但反过来，这种解释本身却不能获得解释。于是，解释便在他这里中止了。内在人不是过去经历和当前行为之间的中介，而是产生行为的中心。他的作用在于启动、开启、创造，这样一来，他便一直被覆盖着一层神秘的面纱，就像他在希腊人心目中的样子一样。因此，我们说，他是自主的——从行为科学的角度说，这意味着他是不可思议的。与之相似，还有外在人（outerman）的概念。\n\n第一章 行为技术 - 位置275\n科学是人类行为，与科学相对立的也是人类行为。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置317\n几乎所有生物的行为都是为了让自己摆脱有害的接触。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置325\n行为还有一个更为重要的作用，它能以另一种方式削弱有害的刺激。虽然它不是以条件反射的形式获得的，但却是一种不同的被称为操作性条件作用的过程的产物。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置341\n他们也可能是“有意”让人厌恶的——他们可能会为了某种结果而以让人厌恶的方式来对待他人。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置347\n厌恶性控制（aversivecontrol）\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置348\n如果有人以令人厌恶的方式对待一个人，直到这个人就范，那么，当这个人做出前者所要求的行为以逃开或避免这种令人厌恶的对待方式时，其结果就强化了前者的行为。不过，他也可以采用别的方式来逃避。另一种变相的逃避方式是攻击那些设置厌恶性条件的人，并削弱或摧毁他们的力量。\n\n第二章 自由- 位置362\n蓄意破坏和暴动骚乱常常是无明确指向对象或指向错误对象的攻击行为。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置391\n在约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒看来，“自由是指一个人能做他想做之事”。自由文献在改变实践的过程中发挥了重要的作用（无论是在什么时候，也无论它在其中发挥了怎样的作用，它都改变了实践），但它却把自己的任务确定为改变心理状态和情感状态。自由是一种“占有”（possession）。人逃避或摧毁控制者的权力是为了感受自由，而一旦他感受到了自由，能做自己想做之事后，自由文献除了提醒他要永远保持警惕以防控制者再次实施控制之外，或许再也推荐不了任何更进一步的行动，也指定不了什么东西了。\n\n第二章 自由  - 位置399\n工资则例证了另一种不同的原则：一个人若按某一特定的方式行事，他就会获得报酬，这样一来，他就会继续以那一特定的方式行事。尽管人们很早以前就已经认识到了奖赏所具有的有效作用，但工资制度的发展却非常缓慢。在19世纪，人们认为，工业社会需要一支饥饿的劳动力队伍。只有当饥饿的工人可以用工资来换取食物时，工资才能发挥实际的效用。如果减少工人对劳动的厌恶感——例如，缩短劳动时间，改善劳动条件——那么，即使报酬降低，也有可能让工人愿意劳动。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置412\n人们通常所说的条件性正强化物（conditioned positive reinforcer），使用后，往往会带来延迟的厌恶性结果。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置483\n还有一个例子是邀请囚犯自愿参加那些很可能有危险的实验——例如，新药物的实验。如果参加实验，囚犯便可以获得更好的生活条件或者减刑。如果囚犯是被迫参加实验的，那么，人人都将反对。但是，当囚犯受到正强化，尤其是当政府施行这种改善生活条件或缩短刑期的做法时，他们真的是自由的吗？\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置491\n自由文献中经常出现的两种观点清楚地表明了人们对于积极控制（positive control）的不确定态度。有人提出，虽然行为完全是被决定的，但一个人“感觉自由”或“认为他自己是自由的”总是要好一些。如果这意味着采取不会产生厌恶性结果的控制方式会更好一些，那我们或许会赞同；但如果这意味着采取不会招致任何人反抗的控制方式更好，那么，这种说法就没有考虑到存在延迟的厌恶性结果的可能性。第二种说法似乎更为恰当一些：“做一个意识清醒的奴隶（slave）比做一个快乐的奴隶好。”“奴隶”这个词澄清了我们正在思考的那些最终后果的实质：它们是剥削性的，因而是令人厌恶的。奴隶所能意识到的是他所经历的悲惨遭遇，而一种精心设计以致不会招来任何反抗的奴隶制度才是真正的威胁所在。自由文献意在让人们“意识到”这种厌恶性控制，但它所选择的方法却不能拯救快乐的奴隶。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置500\n尽管事实上一直是你 [教师]在控制孩子，但你也应该让 [孩子]相信，他一直是在他自己的掌控之中。没有任何形式的征服像保持表面上的自由那样完美，因为在这种征服中，你可以俘获意志本身。可怜的婴儿，一无所知，一无所能，一无所学，难道他不是任你摆布吗？难道你不能为他安排周围世界的一切吗？难道你不能随心所欲地影响他吗？他的学业和游戏、他的痛苦和快乐，难道不都在你的掌控之中而不为他所知吗？毫无疑问，他本应该只做他想做的事情；但他却只应该想做你想让他做的事情；他不应该迈出你没有预见到的步子；在你不知道他要说什么的时候，他就不应该开口。\n\n第二章 自由 - 位置520\n如果不是因为有“一切控制都是错误的”这个毫无根据的概括，我们应该可以像处理非社会问题那样简单地解决社会环境的问题。虽然科技的发展已经让人们摆脱了环境所具有的一些厌恶性特征，但它并没有让人摆脱环境。我们承认我们依赖于周围世界这一事实，而我们要改变的仅仅只是这种依赖的性质。同样，要使社会环境尽可能地摆脱厌恶性刺激，我们并不需要去破坏环境或逃离环境，我们需要重新设计它。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置532\n任何表明一个人的行为可能由外界环境引起的证据，都似乎会对这个人的尊严或价值产生威胁。一个人的成就如果事实上是通过一些他无法控制的力量而取得的，那么，我们往往不会表扬他。我们可以在一定程度上容忍这样的证据，就像我们满不在乎地接受一些表明人并不自由的证据一样。当我们将艺术作品、文学作品、政治生涯、科学发现中的重要成就归因于艺术家、作家、政治家和科学家在各自的生活中所受到的“影响”时，没有谁会因此而感到非常困扰。但是，当行为分析提出的进一步证据表明，一个人之所以取得成就，几乎完全都是外界的原因，而没有他自身的原因时，这种证据及其所依据的科学便会遭到挑战。\n**自由是由于行为的厌恶性结果而引发的一个问题，而尊严（dignity）却与正强化有关。**\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置546\n我们往往会去强化那些强化我们的人，这可能是一种自然倾向，就像我们会攻击那些攻击我们的人一样。不过，相似的行为往往产生于许多不同的社会性相倚联系。我们之所以赞扬那些为我们的利益而工作的人，是因为他们继续那样做便会使我们得到强化。当我们因为某事赞扬某人，我们就确定出了一种额外的强化结果。我们表彰一个赢得比赛的人，是为了强调这样一个事实，即比赛的胜利有赖于他的行为，因此，胜利对他而言可能更具有强化作用。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置573\n我们之所以习惯于称赞那些过独身生活、将所属财产捐赠他人，或者在遭受迫害时仍忠于某项事业的人，是因为他们都有明确的理由可以做出不同的行为。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置576\n就像拉罗什富科所观察到的：“无论是谁，如果他的性格中没有为恶的力量，他的善就不值得称赞。除此之外，其他一切所谓的善都只不过是意志的懒散或软弱而已。”\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置578\n当行为明确受到刺激控制时，褒奖与行为原因的可见性之间的反比关系就表现得尤其明显。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置616\n我们通过让自己置身于通常只会引起无价值行为的条件，同时避免以无价值的方式行事，以此来夸大我们应得的褒奖。我们总是努力找出使行为获得正强化的那些条件，然后又拒绝做出那种行为；我们追求诱惑，就像在沙漠中行走的圣徒在附近安排美女和美食，借此将自己苦行生活的美德最大化。我们就像自行鞭笞者一样，在本可以住手时，却依然继续惩罚自己，或者，在本可以逃脱时，却依然屈从于殉道者的命运。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置656\n我们对于不理解的事物总是心生敬畏，因此，我们越不了解某个行为，就越可能羡慕它，这就不足为奇了。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置671\n我们所说的尊严之战与自由之战有许多共同的特征。移除一种正强化物是令人厌恶的，因此，当人们被剥夺奖赏、赞美或者受赞扬或赞美的机会时，他们也会产生相似的反应。他们会逃离那些剥夺他们的人，或者向其发起攻击，以削弱这些人的力量。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置711\n虽然从事危险、艰苦且令人痛苦的工作的人常常受人称赞，但几乎所有人都愿意放弃因做这些工作而获得的称赞。\n\n第三章 尊严 - 位置728\n我们因一个人的所作所为而给予他奖赏，意味着我们认识到了他的尊严或价值。而我们所给予的奖赏的量通常与他的行为原因的明显性成反比。如果我们不知道一个人为何会如此行事，那我们就会把他的行为归因于他自身。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置748\n惩罚一词通常仅限于由他人蓄意安排的相倚性，而他们之所以要安排这些相倚性，是因为由此产生的结果对他们而言具有强化作用。（我们注意不要将惩罚性相倚联系与厌恶性控制相混淆。厌恶性控制通常被用来引导人们以某些特定的方式行事，而惩罚性相倚联系则常被用来引导人们不以某些特定的方式行事。）\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置759\n惩罚被设计出来，是为了将那些难以处理的、危险的或者不适宜的行为从人的整个行为中清除出去。惩罚的设计基于这样一种假设，即一个人在受到惩罚之后，便不太可能再以同样的方式行事。但不幸的是，事情并非如此简单。奖励与惩罚的不同不仅仅表现在它们所引发之改变的方向上。一个曾因玩性游戏而遭受严厉惩罚的孩子，并不一定不会继续表现出这样的行为；一个曾因其暴行而锒铛入狱的人，也不一定在今后不再表现出暴力行为。被惩罚的行为在惩罚性相倚联系被撤销后，很可能会再次表现出来。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置768\n毫不夸张地说，受过惩罚的人在以后很可能会“为了逃避惩罚”而采取一些行为。他可能会为了避免受罚而采取不会受罚的行为方式，但也存在其他的可能性。其中有些逃避惩罚的方式是破坏性的、适应不良的或者神经症性的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置777\n或者将他人的行为解释为应该受罚，从而投射（projecting）他自己的倾向。他还可以合理化（rationalize）自己的行为，向自己或他人提供一大堆理由，从而使得本该受罚的行为成为不该受罚的行为——例如，他声称，他之所以打孩子，是为了孩子好。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置784\n一个经常因为易于动怒而受罚的人，在下一次动怒前可以先从一数到十。如果在数数的过程中，他做出攻击性行为的倾向降低到了可控的水平，那么，他就可以避免受到惩罚了。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置788\n惩罚性相倚联系还可以包括引导一个人去寻找或建构他在其中能够采取一些行为来取代受罚行为的环境。他会一天到晚忙着做一些不会受罚的事情，从而让自己远离麻烦，譬如坚持不懈地“做着其他一些事情”。（许多似乎不产生积极强化效果因而显得不合理的行为，可能具有取代受罚行为的作用。）个体甚至还可以采取措施来强化那些教导他不要做出受罚行为的相倚联系。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置795\n通过创造一些行为不易受罚的环境，人们便可以减少受罚行为。还有一种可以采取的策略是打破那些使得受罚行为得到强化的相倚联系。另一种策略是安排环境，使得行为在其中可以发生，但不会受到惩罚。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置854\n人们常常会告诉自己该做什么、不该做什么，但却往往忽略了这样一个事实，即他这样做，都是社会一直以来通过言语的方式教导他的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置874\n善就像尊严或价值的其他方面一样，会随着可见控制的减弱而增强。当然，自由同样也是如此。因此，善与自由往往密切相关。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置899\n一个人“打算怎么做”，通常取决于他过去做过的事情，以及在他做过这些事情之后所发生的事情。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置904\n**“只有自由的人才能为自己的行为负责”**，这一观点有两层含义，要看我们是对自由还是对责任感兴趣。如果我们想说人是负有责任的，那么我们就不能干涉他们的自由，因为如果他们没有行动的自由，他们就不能承担起责任。而如果我们想说人是自由的，那么我们就必须通过维持惩罚性相倚联系来促使他们为其行为负责，因为如果他们在明显不具有惩罚性的相倚联系下仍以同样的方式行事，那他们显然就是不自由的。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置924\n我们无法通过增强责任感来解决酗酒和青少年犯罪的问题。该为不良行为“负责”的是环境，必须要改变的也是环境，而不是个体的某种特性。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置944\n酗酒者常常第一个声称自己生了病，而犯下了罪行的青少年则往往会说自己是不良环境的牺牲品。如果他们不用为自己的所作所为承担责任，那他们就不能受到公正的惩罚。\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置948\n**但现在人们普遍认为，没有愚笨的学生，只有不会教的教师；没有不好的孩子，只有不好的父母；青少年犯罪都是执法机构造成的；没有懒惰的人，只有不恰当的激励制度。当然，我们必须反问一句：为什么错的总是教师、父母、政府官员和企业家？正如我们在后面将会看到的，这种观点的错误在于：它总想把责任推给某个人，而且总认为其中存在着某种因果关系。**\n\n第四章 惩罚 - 位置1007\n一个人不会因为受过惩罚而不再以某种特定的方式行事，他至多能学会如何逃避惩罚而已。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023\n放任自流（permissiveness）\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023\n目前，有人已经严肃认真地提出用一种彻头彻尾的放任自流的做法来取代惩罚。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1038\n助产士式的控制（the controller as midwife），一个人帮助另一个人“生出”行为。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1061\n如果我们对一本书的内容已经滚瓜烂熟，或者如果我们对这本书的内容一窍不通，那我们是不会碰这本书的。我们愿意阅读的，通常是那些能帮助我们说出我们想说但又不能靠自己说出来的内容的书籍。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1071\n行为是可以“培养”的。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1073\n教师不能教，他只能帮助学生学。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式- 位置1074\n弗洛伊德认为，一个人的成长必须经历好几个发展阶段，\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1080\n不过，只有施加控制，指导才会有效。指导意味着要开辟新的机会，或者阻止行为朝某个特定的方向发展。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1089\n如果创造出一种环境，让人们在其中快速学会有效的行为，并持续有效地表现出这一行为，那无疑将很有价值。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1097\n依赖于事物而不是依赖于他人的做法，其优点之一在于可以节省他人的时间和精力。一个人应当依赖的“事物”中，还包括那些没有专为改变他的行为而采取行动的人。依赖于事物还有一个重要的优点，那就是：与他人安排的相倚联系相比，与事物有关的相倚联系通常更为精确，且能塑造更为有用的行为。 事物的世界可能是一个专断、暴虐的世界。依赖于事物并不等于独立。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1125\n一个人永远都不可能真正自立。即使他能有效地处理各种事情，他也必定依赖于那些曾经教他这样做的人。是这些人为他选定了他该依赖的事物，并决定了他依赖的形式和程度。（因此，他们不能推卸对结果所应承担的责任。）\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1137\n任何人都不会对提示、暗示、建议做出任何反应，除非他已经拥有某种以某一特定方式行事的倾向。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1140\n树立榜样也是在施加某种类似的控制，它利用了人们会模仿他人言行的一般性倾向。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1150\n只有在个体已经有了某种行动的倾向时，敦促和劝说才会产生效果，而且，只要这种倾向无法解释，我们就可以把他的行为归因于一个内在人。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1172\n我们可以改变一种行为发生的可能性，但我们改变不了需要。我们常以特定的方式来强化行为，但我们给不了一个人目的或意图。我们可以改变对待某物的行为，但改变不了对它的态度。我们可以抽取并改变言语行为，但改变不了观点。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1174\n改变思想的另一种方式，是指明一个人以某种特定方式行为的原因，而这些原因几乎都可能相倚于行为的结果。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1199\n像放任自流、助产术、指导、依赖于事物等方法一样，自由与尊严的捍卫者也对改变思想的方法持容忍的态度，因为它是一种不太有效的改变行为的方法，而且，改变思想者也可以因此而逃避指责，不让别人说他是在控制人。事情出错时，他也可以不用承担责任。这样，自主人就幸存了下来，他会因为所取得的成就受到褒奖，也会因为犯下的错误而受到指责。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1211\n只有存在可利用的其他形式的控制时，控制最少的政府才是最好的政府。\n\n第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1213\n**自由经济并不意味着不要经济控制，这是因为，只要货物与金钱依然具有强化作用，经济就无自由可言。**\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1295\n通过说某物好或坏来进行价值判断，其实是根据这个物体的强化效果对其作一归类。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1388\n正如我们已经看到的，公正或公平的问题常常不过是一个善于管理资源的问题。这个问题在于强化物是否得到了明智的运用。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1428\n任何规则或法律都包含一条有关普遍相倚联系（可能是自然的相倚联系，也可能是社会性的相倚联系）的陈述。\n\n第六章 价值  - 位置1431\n建筑工人戴上安全帽，从而遵守了一条规则。这里的自然相倚联系（涉及保护建筑工人不被下落物击中头部）并不十分有效，因而必须强制实施另一条规则：如果有建筑工人不戴安全帽，他就将被解雇。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1450\n教育领域也是如此：非正式群体的成员通常在有意或无意指导之下相互学习，而有组织的教育则会雇用被我们称为教师的专家，让他们在特定的地方（即我们所说的学校）通过安排与特定强化物（如成绩、文凭）相关的相倚联系来进行教育。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1484\n减少冲突，使用更为有力的强化物，增强相倚联系的作用，从而加强原初的控制。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1488\n如果学生不学习，那不是因为他们对学习不感兴趣，而是因为学习标准太低，或者是因为所学的课程与一种让人满意的生活早已没有任何关联。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1496\n第一步要做的是：确定一个人在为他人利益效力而受到控制时所能获得的利益有哪些。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1528\n人作为一种社会性动物拥有一种优势，那就是：不需要亲自去发现所有的实践活动。\n\n第六章 价值 - 位置1537\n人作为一种社会性动物还有另外一个优势：每一个个体归根结底都是“他人”中的一员，都会实施控制，而且，他们都是为了自己的利益而实施控制的。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1590\n人类学家经常强调，应该用这种能容忍不同观点的相对论来替代宗教狂热，因为宗教狂热力图将所有的文化都转化为一套单一的伦理、政府、宗教或经济方面的价值。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1629\n**文化是一套习俗体系，但不是一套不可与其他习俗体系相融合的体系。**\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1657\n物种和文化首先要面对的都是与自然环境的“竞争”。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1674\n而一个人对自己文化之生存的感受，则取决于该文化采用什么样的手段来诱使其成员为其生存而效力。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1695\n生存是我们最终评价一种文化的唯一价值，从定义上看，任何能促进生存的习俗都具有生存价值。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1721\n文化的演进是“进步”吗？它的目标是什么？它的目标是产生一种与那些诱使个体为其文化之生存而努力的结果。\n\n第七章 一种文化的演进 - 位置1765\n我们说某些文化尚未充分发展或不成熟，那是相对于我们所说的其他“先进”文化而言的。但是，如果有人说有哪种政府、宗教或经济制度是成熟的制度，那么，这实际上是一种低级的沙文主义。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置1860\n通过改变行为发挥作用的条件，便可以改变行为。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置1933\n失败并不总是错误，它或许只是一个人在当时的情形之下所能做出的最好选择。其实真正的错误是停止尝试。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置2037\n这个世界之所以会被喜欢，是因为人们所接受的教育要求他们要喜欢它，而至于为什么要喜欢，则并非总有人去做细细的审查。\n\n第八章 一种文化的设计 - 位置2186\n生存价值会随着环境的改变而改变。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2277\n一个人的行为在某种程度上应归因于先前的事件，而且相比于人自身，环境更可能对人的行为产生影响。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2357\n**有人说，人之所以有别于其他动物，主要是因为他能“意识到他自己的存在”。**\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2456\n这个问题在神学中占有奇妙的地位。人是因为邪恶才犯罪，还是因为犯了罪才邪恶？事实上，这两种问法都不能说明任何有用的东西。说一个人是因为犯了罪才邪恶，其实是给犯罪下了一个操作性定义。而说一个人是因为邪恶才犯罪，也只不过是把他的行为归咎到了一种假想的内在特性上。但是，一个人是否会做出那种被称为犯罪的行为，通常取决于上述两种问法都没有提及的环境条件。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2475\n自我就是一整套与某一既定系列的相倚联系相适应的行为。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2568\n人自身可能会受到周围环境的控制，但周围的环境几乎全部都是由他自己创造的。大多数人的物质环境基本上都是人造的。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2595\n人所造就的人，其实是人所设计之文化的产物。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2615\n甚至在组织最为严密的文化中，每一个人的经历也都是独特的。任何有意设计的文化都不能消除这种独特性，而且正如我们已经看到的，任何旨在消除独特性的努力都是糟糕的设计。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2622\n**个人主义（individualism）面临的最大问题是死亡——它是个体无法逃避的命运，是对自由和尊严的致命打击。**\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2656\n再有一种影响就是怀旧感（nostalgia）。当人们抓住并夸大了现在与过去之间的相似之处时，旧有的技能便会涌现出来。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2661\n任何事物都不会因为我们审视它、谈论它或以一种新的方式分析它而有所改变。\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2690\n一种新理论可以改变的只不过是我们对其研究对象所做的事情。一种关于人的科学观点提供了各种让人兴奋的可能性。我们至今尚未看到人到底将人造就成了什么样子。\n\n第九章 人是什么- 位置2809\n当我们让某人喝一两杯酒从而让他高兴起来，或者当他自己喝了点酒或抽了点大麻从而“减少了他内在世界的厌恶性特征”时，他的感受似乎发生了改变。但是，真正发生改变的不是感受，而是所感觉到的身体状态。一种文化的设计者往往会改变伴随与环境相关之行为的感受，而且，他通常是通过改变环境做到这一点的。\n\n第九章 人是什么 - 位置2884\n由于传递模式的不同，“一代人”在生物进化和文化演进过程中的含义往往会有很大的差异。在文化演进过程中，它只不过是一个衡量时间的尺度。仅在一代人的身上，文化方面的变化（“变异”）就有可能出现，而且可能会被传递很多次。\n","slug":"超越自由与尊严","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.506Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vkso005rpmnk8lwdc2m2","content":"<p>第一章 行为技术 - 位置147\n此外，将行为视作一种功能的条件也被人们忽略了。对于好奇心，人们最终得出的往往是心理的解释。在日常交谈中，我们常常会看到这一点。如果我们问某人“你为什么要去看戏剧？”，他回答说“因为我想去”，我们很容易把他的回答当成一种解释。我们更应该了解的是他以前去看戏剧时曾发生过什么，他去看戏时曾听到或看到过什么，他过去或当前的环境中有哪些东西可能会促使他去看戏（而不是去做其他事情）。但实际上，我们往往会将“我想去”这三个字看成对上述这些问题的总结，而且很可能不会再去询问更多的细节。\n<span id=\"more\"></span> 第一章行为技术 - 位置167\n内在人（innerman）的作用在于提供一种解释，但反过来，这种解释本身却不能获得解释。于是，解释便在他这里中止了。内在人不是过去经历和当前行为之间的中介，而是产生行为的中心。他的作用在于启动、开启、创造，这样一来，他便一直被覆盖着一层神秘的面纱，就像他在希腊人心目中的样子一样。因此，我们说，他是自主的——从行为科学的角度说，这意味着他是不可思议的。与之相似，还有外在人（outerman）的概念。</p>\n<p>第一章 行为技术 - 位置275\n科学是人类行为，与科学相对立的也是人类行为。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置317\n几乎所有生物的行为都是为了让自己摆脱有害的接触。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置325\n行为还有一个更为重要的作用，它能以另一种方式削弱有害的刺激。虽然它不是以条件反射的形式获得的，但却是一种不同的被称为操作性条件作用的过程的产物。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置341\n他们也可能是“有意”让人厌恶的——他们可能会为了某种结果而以让人厌恶的方式来对待他人。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置347 厌恶性控制（aversivecontrol）</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置348\n如果有人以令人厌恶的方式对待一个人，直到这个人就范，那么，当这个人做出前者所要求的行为以逃开或避免这种令人厌恶的对待方式时，其结果就强化了前者的行为。不过，他也可以采用别的方式来逃避。另一种变相的逃避方式是攻击那些设置厌恶性条件的人，并削弱或摧毁他们的力量。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由- 位置362\n蓄意破坏和暴动骚乱常常是无明确指向对象或指向错误对象的攻击行为。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置391\n在约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒看来，“自由是指一个人能做他想做之事”。自由文献在改变实践的过程中发挥了重要的作用（无论是在什么时候，也无论它在其中发挥了怎样的作用，它都改变了实践），但它却把自己的任务确定为改变心理状态和情感状态。自由是一种“占有”（possession）。人逃避或摧毁控制者的权力是为了感受自由，而一旦他感受到了自由，能做自己想做之事后，自由文献除了提醒他要永远保持警惕以防控制者再次实施控制之外，或许再也推荐不了任何更进一步的行动，也指定不了什么东西了。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置399\n工资则例证了另一种不同的原则：一个人若按某一特定的方式行事，他就会获得报酬，这样一来，他就会继续以那一特定的方式行事。尽管人们很早以前就已经认识到了奖赏所具有的有效作用，但工资制度的发展却非常缓慢。在19世纪，人们认为，工业社会需要一支饥饿的劳动力队伍。只有当饥饿的工人可以用工资来换取食物时，工资才能发挥实际的效用。如果减少工人对劳动的厌恶感——例如，缩短劳动时间，改善劳动条件——那么，即使报酬降低，也有可能让工人愿意劳动。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置412 人们通常所说的条件性正强化物（conditioned\npositive reinforcer），使用后，往往会带来延迟的厌恶性结果。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置483\n还有一个例子是邀请囚犯自愿参加那些很可能有危险的实验——例如，新药物的实验。如果参加实验，囚犯便可以获得更好的生活条件或者减刑。如果囚犯是被迫参加实验的，那么，人人都将反对。但是，当囚犯受到正强化，尤其是当政府施行这种改善生活条件或缩短刑期的做法时，他们真的是自由的吗？</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置491\n自由文献中经常出现的两种观点清楚地表明了人们对于积极控制（positive\ncontrol）的不确定态度。有人提出，虽然行为完全是被决定的，但一个人“感觉自由”或“认为他自己是自由的”总是要好一些。如果这意味着采取不会产生厌恶性结果的控制方式会更好一些，那我们或许会赞同；但如果这意味着采取不会招致任何人反抗的控制方式更好，那么，这种说法就没有考虑到存在延迟的厌恶性结果的可能性。第二种说法似乎更为恰当一些：“做一个意识清醒的奴隶（slave）比做一个快乐的奴隶好。”“奴隶”这个词澄清了我们正在思考的那些最终后果的实质：它们是剥削性的，因而是令人厌恶的。奴隶所能意识到的是他所经历的悲惨遭遇，而一种精心设计以致不会招来任何反抗的奴隶制度才是真正的威胁所在。自由文献意在让人们“意识到”这种厌恶性控制，但它所选择的方法却不能拯救快乐的奴隶。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置500 尽管事实上一直是你\n[教师]在控制孩子，但你也应该让\n[孩子]相信，他一直是在他自己的掌控之中。没有任何形式的征服像保持表面上的自由那样完美，因为在这种征服中，你可以俘获意志本身。可怜的婴儿，一无所知，一无所能，一无所学，难道他不是任你摆布吗？难道你不能为他安排周围世界的一切吗？难道你不能随心所欲地影响他吗？他的学业和游戏、他的痛苦和快乐，难道不都在你的掌控之中而不为他所知吗？毫无疑问，他本应该只做他想做的事情；但他却只应该想做你想让他做的事情；他不应该迈出你没有预见到的步子；在你不知道他要说什么的时候，他就不应该开口。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置520\n如果不是因为有“一切控制都是错误的”这个毫无根据的概括，我们应该可以像处理非社会问题那样简单地解决社会环境的问题。虽然科技的发展已经让人们摆脱了环境所具有的一些厌恶性特征，但它并没有让人摆脱环境。我们承认我们依赖于周围世界这一事实，而我们要改变的仅仅只是这种依赖的性质。同样，要使社会环境尽可能地摆脱厌恶性刺激，我们并不需要去破坏环境或逃离环境，我们需要重新设计它。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置532\n任何表明一个人的行为可能由外界环境引起的证据，都似乎会对这个人的尊严或价值产生威胁。一个人的成就如果事实上是通过一些他无法控制的力量而取得的，那么，我们往往不会表扬他。我们可以在一定程度上容忍这样的证据，就像我们满不在乎地接受一些表明人并不自由的证据一样。当我们将艺术作品、文学作品、政治生涯、科学发现中的重要成就归因于艺术家、作家、政治家和科学家在各自的生活中所受到的“影响”时，没有谁会因此而感到非常困扰。但是，当行为分析提出的进一步证据表明，一个人之所以取得成就，几乎完全都是外界的原因，而没有他自身的原因时，这种证据及其所依据的科学便会遭到挑战。\n<strong>自由是由于行为的厌恶性结果而引发的一个问题，而尊严（dignity）却与正强化有关。</strong></p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置546\n我们往往会去强化那些强化我们的人，这可能是一种自然倾向，就像我们会攻击那些攻击我们的人一样。不过，相似的行为往往产生于许多不同的社会性相倚联系。我们之所以赞扬那些为我们的利益而工作的人，是因为他们继续那样做便会使我们得到强化。当我们因为某事赞扬某人，我们就确定出了一种额外的强化结果。我们表彰一个赢得比赛的人，是为了强调这样一个事实，即比赛的胜利有赖于他的行为，因此，胜利对他而言可能更具有强化作用。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置573\n我们之所以习惯于称赞那些过独身生活、将所属财产捐赠他人，或者在遭受迫害时仍忠于某项事业的人，是因为他们都有明确的理由可以做出不同的行为。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置576\n就像拉罗什富科所观察到的：“无论是谁，如果他的性格中没有为恶的力量，他的善就不值得称赞。除此之外，其他一切所谓的善都只不过是意志的懒散或软弱而已。”</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置578\n当行为明确受到刺激控制时，褒奖与行为原因的可见性之间的反比关系就表现得尤其明显。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置616\n我们通过让自己置身于通常只会引起无价值行为的条件，同时避免以无价值的方式行事，以此来夸大我们应得的褒奖。我们总是努力找出使行为获得正强化的那些条件，然后又拒绝做出那种行为；我们追求诱惑，就像在沙漠中行走的圣徒在附近安排美女和美食，借此将自己苦行生活的美德最大化。我们就像自行鞭笞者一样，在本可以住手时，却依然继续惩罚自己，或者，在本可以逃脱时，却依然屈从于殉道者的命运。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置656\n我们对于不理解的事物总是心生敬畏，因此，我们越不了解某个行为，就越可能羡慕它，这就不足为奇了。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置671\n我们所说的尊严之战与自由之战有许多共同的特征。移除一种正强化物是令人厌恶的，因此，当人们被剥夺奖赏、赞美或者受赞扬或赞美的机会时，他们也会产生相似的反应。他们会逃离那些剥夺他们的人，或者向其发起攻击，以削弱这些人的力量。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置711\n虽然从事危险、艰苦且令人痛苦的工作的人常常受人称赞，但几乎所有人都愿意放弃因做这些工作而获得的称赞。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置728\n我们因一个人的所作所为而给予他奖赏，意味着我们认识到了他的尊严或价值。而我们所给予的奖赏的量通常与他的行为原因的明显性成反比。如果我们不知道一个人为何会如此行事，那我们就会把他的行为归因于他自身。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置748\n惩罚一词通常仅限于由他人蓄意安排的相倚性，而他们之所以要安排这些相倚性，是因为由此产生的结果对他们而言具有强化作用。（我们注意不要将惩罚性相倚联系与厌恶性控制相混淆。厌恶性控制通常被用来引导人们以某些特定的方式行事，而惩罚性相倚联系则常被用来引导人们不以某些特定的方式行事。）</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置759\n惩罚被设计出来，是为了将那些难以处理的、危险的或者不适宜的行为从人的整个行为中清除出去。惩罚的设计基于这样一种假设，即一个人在受到惩罚之后，便不太可能再以同样的方式行事。但不幸的是，事情并非如此简单。奖励与惩罚的不同不仅仅表现在它们所引发之改变的方向上。一个曾因玩性游戏而遭受严厉惩罚的孩子，并不一定不会继续表现出这样的行为；一个曾因其暴行而锒铛入狱的人，也不一定在今后不再表现出暴力行为。被惩罚的行为在惩罚性相倚联系被撤销后，很可能会再次表现出来。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置768\n毫不夸张地说，受过惩罚的人在以后很可能会“为了逃避惩罚”而采取一些行为。他可能会为了避免受罚而采取不会受罚的行为方式，但也存在其他的可能性。其中有些逃避惩罚的方式是破坏性的、适应不良的或者神经症性的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置777\n或者将他人的行为解释为应该受罚，从而投射（projecting）他自己的倾向。他还可以合理化（rationalize）自己的行为，向自己或他人提供一大堆理由，从而使得本该受罚的行为成为不该受罚的行为——例如，他声称，他之所以打孩子，是为了孩子好。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置784\n一个经常因为易于动怒而受罚的人，在下一次动怒前可以先从一数到十。如果在数数的过程中，他做出攻击性行为的倾向降低到了可控的水平，那么，他就可以避免受到惩罚了。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置788\n惩罚性相倚联系还可以包括引导一个人去寻找或建构他在其中能够采取一些行为来取代受罚行为的环境。他会一天到晚忙着做一些不会受罚的事情，从而让自己远离麻烦，譬如坚持不懈地“做着其他一些事情”。（许多似乎不产生积极强化效果因而显得不合理的行为，可能具有取代受罚行为的作用。）个体甚至还可以采取措施来强化那些教导他不要做出受罚行为的相倚联系。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置795\n通过创造一些行为不易受罚的环境，人们便可以减少受罚行为。还有一种可以采取的策略是打破那些使得受罚行为得到强化的相倚联系。另一种策略是安排环境，使得行为在其中可以发生，但不会受到惩罚。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置854\n人们常常会告诉自己该做什么、不该做什么，但却往往忽略了这样一个事实，即他这样做，都是社会一直以来通过言语的方式教导他的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置874\n善就像尊严或价值的其他方面一样，会随着可见控制的减弱而增强。当然，自由同样也是如此。因此，善与自由往往密切相关。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置899\n一个人“打算怎么做”，通常取决于他过去做过的事情，以及在他做过这些事情之后所发生的事情。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置904\n<strong>“只有自由的人才能为自己的行为负责”</strong>，这一观点有两层含义，要看我们是对自由还是对责任感兴趣。如果我们想说人是负有责任的，那么我们就不能干涉他们的自由，因为如果他们没有行动的自由，他们就不能承担起责任。而如果我们想说人是自由的，那么我们就必须通过维持惩罚性相倚联系来促使他们为其行为负责，因为如果他们在明显不具有惩罚性的相倚联系下仍以同样的方式行事，那他们显然就是不自由的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置924\n我们无法通过增强责任感来解决酗酒和青少年犯罪的问题。该为不良行为“负责”的是环境，必须要改变的也是环境，而不是个体的某种特性。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置944\n酗酒者常常第一个声称自己生了病，而犯下了罪行的青少年则往往会说自己是不良环境的牺牲品。如果他们不用为自己的所作所为承担责任，那他们就不能受到公正的惩罚。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置948\n<strong>但现在人们普遍认为，没有愚笨的学生，只有不会教的教师；没有不好的孩子，只有不好的父母；青少年犯罪都是执法机构造成的；没有懒惰的人，只有不恰当的激励制度。当然，我们必须反问一句：为什么错的总是教师、父母、政府官员和企业家？正如我们在后面将会看到的，这种观点的错误在于：它总想把责任推给某个人，而且总认为其中存在着某种因果关系。</strong></p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置1007\n一个人不会因为受过惩罚而不再以某种特定的方式行事，他至多能学会如何逃避惩罚而已。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023 放任自流（permissiveness）</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1023\n目前，有人已经严肃认真地提出用一种彻头彻尾的放任自流的做法来取代惩罚。</p>\n<p>第五章 惩罚以外的方式 - 位置1038

位置147\n此外，将行为视作一种功能的条件也被人们忽略了。对于好奇心，人们最终得出的往往是心理的解释。在日常交谈中，我们常常会看到这一点。如果我们问某人“你为什么要去看戏剧？”，他回答说“因为我想去”，我们很容易把他的回答当成一种解释。我们更应该了解的是他以前去看戏剧时曾发生过什么，他去看戏时曾听到或看到过什么，他过去或当前的环境中有哪些东西可能会促使他去看戏（而不是去做其他事情）。但实际上，我们往往会将“我想去”这三个字看成对上述这些问题的总结，而且很可能不会再去询问更多的细节。","more":"第一章行为技术

位置362\n蓄意破坏和暴动骚乱常常是无明确指向对象或指向错误对象的攻击行为。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置391\n在约翰·斯图亚特·穆勒看来，“自由是指一个人能做他想做之事”。自由文献在改变实践的过程中发挥了重要的作用（无论是在什么时候，也无论它在其中发挥了怎样的作用，它都改变了实践），但它却把自己的任务确定为改变心理状态和情感状态。自由是一种“占有”（possession）。人逃避或摧毁控制者的权力是为了感受自由，而一旦他感受到了自由，能做自己想做之事后，自由文献除了提醒他要永远保持警惕以防控制者再次实施控制之外，或许再也推荐不了任何更进一步的行动，也指定不了什么东西了。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置399\n工资则例证了另一种不同的原则：一个人若按某一特定的方式行事，他就会获得报酬，这样一来，他就会继续以那一特定的方式行事。尽管人们很早以前就已经认识到了奖赏所具有的有效作用，但工资制度的发展却非常缓慢。在19世纪，人们认为，工业社会需要一支饥饿的劳动力队伍。只有当饥饿的工人可以用工资来换取食物时，工资才能发挥实际的效用。如果减少工人对劳动的厌恶感——例如，缩短劳动时间，改善劳动条件——那么，即使报酬降低，也有可能让工人愿意劳动。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置412 人们通常所说的条件性正强化物（conditioned\npositive reinforcer），使用后，往往会带来延迟的厌恶性结果。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置483\n还有一个例子是邀请囚犯自愿参加那些很可能有危险的实验——例如，新药物的实验。如果参加实验，囚犯便可以获得更好的生活条件或者减刑。如果囚犯是被迫参加实验的，那么，人人都将反对。但是，当囚犯受到正强化，尤其是当政府施行这种改善生活条件或缩短刑期的做法时，他们真的是自由的吗？</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置491\n自由文献中经常出现的两种观点清楚地表明了人们对于积极控制（positive\ncontrol）的不确定态度。有人提出，虽然行为完全是被决定的，但一个人“感觉自由”或“认为他自己是自由的”总是要好一些。如果这意味着采取不会产生厌恶性结果的控制方式会更好一些，那我们或许会赞同；但如果这意味着采取不会招致任何人反抗的控制方式更好，那么，这种说法就没有考虑到存在延迟的厌恶性结果的可能性。第二种说法似乎更为恰当一些：“做一个意识清醒的奴隶（slave）比做一个快乐的奴隶好。”“奴隶”这个词澄清了我们正在思考的那些最终后果的实质：它们是剥削性的，因而是令人厌恶的。奴隶所能意识到的是他所经历的悲惨遭遇，而一种精心设计以致不会招来任何反抗的奴隶制度才是真正的威胁所在。自由文献意在让人们“意识到”这种厌恶性控制，但它所选择的方法却不能拯救快乐的奴隶。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置500 尽管事实上一直是你\n[教师]在控制孩子，但你也应该让\n[孩子]相信，他一直是在他自己的掌控之中。没有任何形式的征服像保持表面上的自由那样完美，因为在这种征服中，你可以俘获意志本身。可怜的婴儿，一无所知，一无所能，一无所学，难道他不是任你摆布吗？难道你不能为他安排周围世界的一切吗？难道你不能随心所欲地影响他吗？他的学业和游戏、他的痛苦和快乐，难道不都在你的掌控之中而不为他所知吗？毫无疑问，他本应该只做他想做的事情；但他却只应该想做你想让他做的事情；他不应该迈出你没有预见到的步子；在你不知道他要说什么的时候，他就不应该开口。</p>\n<p>第二章 自由 - 位置520\n如果不是因为有“一切控制都是错误的”这个毫无根据的概括，我们应该可以像处理非社会问题那样简单地解决社会环境的问题。虽然科技的发展已经让人们摆脱了环境所具有的一些厌恶性特征，但它并没有让人摆脱环境。我们承认我们依赖于周围世界这一事实，而我们要改变的仅仅只是这种依赖的性质。同样，要使社会环境尽可能地摆脱厌恶性刺激，我们并不需要去破坏环境或逃离环境，我们需要重新设计它。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置532\n任何表明一个人的行为可能由外界环境引起的证据，都似乎会对这个人的尊严或价值产生威胁。一个人的成就如果事实上是通过一些他无法控制的力量而取得的，那么，我们往往不会表扬他。我们可以在一定程度上容忍这样的证据，就像我们满不在乎地接受一些表明人并不自由的证据一样。当我们将艺术作品、文学作品、政治生涯、科学发现中的重要成就归因于艺术家、作家、政治家和科学家在各自的生活中所受到的“影响”时，没有谁会因此而感到非常困扰。但是，当行为分析提出的进一步证据表明，一个人之所以取得成就，几乎完全都是外界的原因，而没有他自身的原因时，这种证据及其所依据的科学便会遭到挑战。\n<strong>自由是由于行为的厌恶性结果而引发的一个问题，而尊严（dignity）却与正强化有关。</strong></p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置546\n我们往往会去强化那些强化我们的人，这可能是一种自然倾向，就像我们会攻击那些攻击我们的人一样。不过，相似的行为往往产生于许多不同的社会性相倚联系。我们之所以赞扬那些为我们的利益而工作的人，是因为他们继续那样做便会使我们得到强化。当我们因为某事赞扬某人，我们就确定出了一种额外的强化结果。我们表彰一个赢得比赛的人，是为了强调这样一个事实，即比赛的胜利有赖于他的行为，因此，胜利对他而言可能更具有强化作用。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置573\n我们之所以习惯于称赞那些过独身生活、将所属财产捐赠他人，或者在遭受迫害时仍忠于某项事业的人，是因为他们都有明确的理由可以做出不同的行为。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置576\n就像拉罗什富科所观察到的：“无论是谁，如果他的性格中没有为恶的力量，他的善就不值得称赞。除此之外，其他一切所谓的善都只不过是意志的懒散或软弱而已。”</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置578\n当行为明确受到刺激控制时，褒奖与行为原因的可见性之间的反比关系就表现得尤其明显。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置616\n我们通过让自己置身于通常只会引起无价值行为的条件，同时避免以无价值的方式行事，以此来夸大我们应得的褒奖。我们总是努力找出使行为获得正强化的那些条件，然后又拒绝做出那种行为；我们追求诱惑，就像在沙漠中行走的圣徒在附近安排美女和美食，借此将自己苦行生活的美德最大化。我们就像自行鞭笞者一样，在本可以住手时，却依然继续惩罚自己，或者，在本可以逃脱时，却依然屈从于殉道者的命运。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置656\n我们对于不理解的事物总是心生敬畏，因此，我们越不了解某个行为，就越可能羡慕它，这就不足为奇了。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置671\n我们所说的尊严之战与自由之战有许多共同的特征。移除一种正强化物是令人厌恶的，因此，当人们被剥夺奖赏、赞美或者受赞扬或赞美的机会时，他们也会产生相似的反应。他们会逃离那些剥夺他们的人，或者向其发起攻击，以削弱这些人的力量。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置711\n虽然从事危险、艰苦且令人痛苦的工作的人常常受人称赞，但几乎所有人都愿意放弃因做这些工作而获得的称赞。</p>\n<p>第三章 尊严 - 位置728\n我们因一个人的所作所为而给予他奖赏，意味着我们认识到了他的尊严或价值。而我们所给予的奖赏的量通常与他的行为原因的明显性成反比。如果我们不知道一个人为何会如此行事，那我们就会把他的行为归因于他自身。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置748\n惩罚一词通常仅限于由他人蓄意安排的相倚性，而他们之所以要安排这些相倚性，是因为由此产生的结果对他们而言具有强化作用。（我们注意不要将惩罚性相倚联系与厌恶性控制相混淆。厌恶性控制通常被用来引导人们以某些特定的方式行事，而惩罚性相倚联系则常被用来引导人们不以某些特定的方式行事。）</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置759\n惩罚被设计出来，是为了将那些难以处理的、危险的或者不适宜的行为从人的整个行为中清除出去。惩罚的设计基于这样一种假设，即一个人在受到惩罚之后，便不太可能再以同样的方式行事。但不幸的是，事情并非如此简单。奖励与惩罚的不同不仅仅表现在它们所引发之改变的方向上。一个曾因玩性游戏而遭受严厉惩罚的孩子，并不一定不会继续表现出这样的行为；一个曾因其暴行而锒铛入狱的人，也不一定在今后不再表现出暴力行为。被惩罚的行为在惩罚性相倚联系被撤销后，很可能会再次表现出来。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置768\n毫不夸张地说，受过惩罚的人在以后很可能会“为了逃避惩罚”而采取一些行为。他可能会为了避免受罚而采取不会受罚的行为方式，但也存在其他的可能性。其中有些逃避惩罚的方式是破坏性的、适应不良的或者神经症性的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置777\n或者将他人的行为解释为应该受罚，从而投射（projecting）他自己的倾向。他还可以合理化（rationalize）自己的行为，向自己或他人提供一大堆理由，从而使得本该受罚的行为成为不该受罚的行为——例如，他声称，他之所以打孩子，是为了孩子好。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置784\n一个经常因为易于动怒而受罚的人，在下一次动怒前可以先从一数到十。如果在数数的过程中，他做出攻击性行为的倾向降低到了可控的水平，那么，他就可以避免受到惩罚了。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置788\n惩罚性相倚联系还可以包括引导一个人去寻找或建构他在其中能够采取一些行为来取代受罚行为的环境。他会一天到晚忙着做一些不会受罚的事情，从而让自己远离麻烦，譬如坚持不懈地“做着其他一些事情”。（许多似乎不产生积极强化效果因而显得不合理的行为，可能具有取代受罚行为的作用。）个体甚至还可以采取措施来强化那些教导他不要做出受罚行为的相倚联系。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置795\n通过创造一些行为不易受罚的环境，人们便可以减少受罚行为。还有一种可以采取的策略是打破那些使得受罚行为得到强化的相倚联系。另一种策略是安排环境，使得行为在其中可以发生，但不会受到惩罚。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置854\n人们常常会告诉自己该做什么、不该做什么，但却往往忽略了这样一个事实，即他这样做，都是社会一直以来通过言语的方式教导他的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置874\n善就像尊严或价值的其他方面一样，会随着可见控制的减弱而增强。当然，自由同样也是如此。因此，善与自由往往密切相关。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置899\n一个人“打算怎么做”，通常取决于他过去做过的事情，以及在他做过这些事情之后所发生的事情。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置904\n<strong>“只有自由的人才能为自己的行为负责”</strong>，这一观点有两层含义，要看我们是对自由还是对责任感兴趣。如果我们想说人是负有责任的，那么我们就不能干涉他们的自由，因为如果他们没有行动的自由，他们就不能承担起责任。而如果我们想说人是自由的，那么我们就必须通过维持惩罚性相倚联系来促使他们为其行为负责，因为如果他们在明显不具有惩罚性的相倚联系下仍以同样的方式行事，那他们显然就是不自由的。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置924\n我们无法通过增强责任感来解决酗酒和青少年犯罪的问题。该为不良行为“负责”的是环境，必须要改变的也是环境，而不是个体的某种特性。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置944\n酗酒者常常第一个声称自己生了病，而犯下了罪行的青少年则往往会说自己是不良环境的牺牲品。如果他们不用为自己的所作所为承担责任，那他们就不能受到公正的惩罚。</p>\n<p>第四章 惩罚 - 位置948\n<strong>但现在人们普遍认为，没有愚笨的学生，只有不会教的教师；没有不好的孩子，只有不好的父母；青少年犯罪都是执法机构造成的；没有懒惰的人，只有不恰当的激励制度。当然，我们必须反问一句：为什么错的总是教师、父母、政府官员和企业家？正如我们在后面将会看到的，这种观点的错误在于：它总想把责任推给某个人，而且总认为其中存在着某种因果关系。</strong></p>\n<p>第四章

- 海滨漫步 &gt; 位置 9826\n时间可以讲述吗？那本原的、纯粹的时间本身，可以讲述吗？不能，确实不能，要讲就真是犯傻！就只能讲什么：“时间流动着，它在流逝，像江水似的流逝。”如此这般地一个劲儿往下讲，——恐怕没有一个神经健全的人会称这是在讲述故事。这好有一比，正如把同一个音符或者和弦拼命拖长到一小时，却称自己是在——演奏音乐一样。因为这“故事”和这“音乐”，两者之间有一个共同点，就是都消磨了时间，都“实实在在地填补了时间的空虚”，都对时间进行了“分割”，都使它“有了内容”，都让它“发挥了作用”，——在此我们怀着在引述死者遗言时应有的沉痛而虔诚的心情，引述已故约阿希姆偶尔说过的这些话，这些早已音沉响绝的话，——我们不知道读者是不是清楚，他说完这些话已经过去了多久。时间是故事的要素，正如它也是生命的要素，——故事和生命，它们都与时间密不可分，正如物体与空间密不可分。时间也是音乐的要素；音乐度量时间、分割时间，在使时间显得短促的同时变得可贵。如前所述，故事的情况也类似于此，同样只能循序渐进地、一点一点地进行展现，即使企图在任何一个瞬间得到充分的表现，也仍然须耗费时间。这与一劳永逸地呈现出来的造型艺术不同，造型艺术作品只是作为物体与时间发生联系。","more":"事情一目了然。不过两者的区别也显而易见。音乐的时间因素只是一码事，只是人类地球时间的一个断面，音乐注入这个断面，就使其变得说不出的高贵。故事相反有两种时间：一为其本身的时间，亦即构成其讲述和表现条件的音乐性实际时间；二为其内容所表现的时间，即透视性的时间，也就是故事的想象时间，它与实际时间的量度差异极大，既几乎可以甚至完全可以与音乐性实际时间相吻合，也可以与其相差十万八千里。一首名为《五分钟华尔兹》的乐曲确实演奏五分钟，——它与时间的关系仅止于此，别无其他。一则故事可就不同了，它的想象时间跨度仅为五分钟，可由于讲述得格外认真仔细，实际讲述时间就可以拖长一千倍——这时，时间显得短而容易度过，尽管对于故事的想象时间而言，它是很长很长的了。反过来故事的想象时间也可以用“浓缩法”将其自身无限扩展，——我们所谓的“浓缩法”，指的就是某种幻觉的或者干脆讲病态的因素，它显然适用于我们这里的情况；也就是故事的讲述采用神秘的魔法和时间的超透视法，它们让人想起了实际生活中的某些异常现象，以及明白无误的超感知状态。有一些吸食鸦片者的笔记表明，一个处于麻醉状态的瘾君子在短时间里体验到的迷幻情景，常常相当于十年、三十年甚至六十年或者超过了人所能设定的任何时间界限，——说的当然只是幻觉，只是其幻想时间大大超过了实际时间的长度；处于这样的迷幻状态，人对时间的体验浓缩到了难以置信的程度，幻象的情景急速地拥挤到一起，用一个吸食大麻者的话说，脑子已变得仿佛“像一块取走弹簧后不再有用的破表。”</p>\n<p>故事中的时间关系跟这里说的罪恶迷幻状态类似，也可以用类似的方式对它进行处理。不过既然能够“处理”，那就明摆着，时间这一故事要素也可变成故事处理的对象；这样一来，如果说“讲述时间的故事”还嫌过分的话，那么说想要讲讲有关时间的故事，就不显得像本章开始时我们感觉的那样完全荒谬了；——结果是“时间小说”这个名称，就有了奇特的梦幻般的双重含义。事实上我们最先提出时间是否可以讲述这个问题，只是为了承认我们讲述故事实际上也是要讲述时间。接着我们又问，那些聚集在我们周围的人是否清楚，自从已故的约阿希姆发表了那一通关于音乐与时间的议论——这样的议论原本不合他的天性，只能证明他体内的化学反应大大地增强了——至今已经过去多少时间，如果得到的回答是他们眼下真的不十分清楚，那我们也不会怎么生气；是的，不怎么生气，甚至还心满意足。之所以这样，原因很简单：大家都关注小说主人公本身的境遇体验，自然符合我们的利益；对现在讲到的这个时刻，汉斯·\n卡斯托普本人绝非完全心中有数，而且早就已经不再有数了。这种情况，也是他的故事亦即一部时间小说的内容之一；过去如此——现在仍然如此。</p>\n<p>第七章

- 晴天霹雳 > 位置 13050\n我们在哪里？这是怎么回事？梦境把我们抛到了何处？薄暮、暴雨、泥泞，晦暗的天空燃烧着残霞，沉闷的雷声不断地咆哮，空中充满着湿气，尖厉的啸叫撕裂耳膜，蜂拥奔来的地狱恶犬发出狂吠，其间夹杂着崩裂声、喷溅声、撞击声，熊熊燃烧声，乒乒乓乓，轰轰隆隆，鬼哭狼嚎，鼓点的节奏越来越快，越来越急迫……那边有座森林，林子里蹿出来一群群灰白的人影，奔跑着、扑跌着、跳跃着。那边是一线连绵起伏的丘陵，丘陵背后的远方燃起了大火，火苗不时地聚集成熊熊的烈焰。在我们四周是如波浪起伏的田野，但已给炸得满目疮痍，七零八落。泥泞的公路上撒满折断的树枝，像森林里一样；一条满是沟沟坑坑的小路接着公路，在通往丘陵时划了一个弧形，树木光秃秃地立在冷雨里，枝杈嶙峋……这儿有块路标，——可想凭它找路却白费劲儿；即使它没给炸裂开，字迹也让晦明的光线弄得模模糊糊。到底是东还是西？只知道这是一片平原，而且正在打仗。我们呢只是路旁一些畏畏缩缩的影子，并且由于享有影子的安全而怀着羞惭；我们压根儿想不到夸夸其谈、自吹自擂，而是本着老老实实讲故事的精神，讲那些从树林中蜂拥而出的灰色的士兵，讲他们如何奔跑、扑跌，如何爬起来擂着战鼓继续前进；讲他们中有一个我们认识，是我们多年的旅伴，他就是那个善良却有罪的青年，我们曾经时常听见他的声音，因此想在他从我们的视线中彻底消失之前，再凝视一下他那单纯的脸。\n\n战斗已经持续一整天，上级调这些兄弟们前来增援，是为重新夺回两天前落到了敌人手里的丘陵阵地，以及背后那些燃烧着的村庄。调来了一个志愿兵团，士兵全都年纪轻轻，多数是大学生，刚上战场不久。他们半夜被集合起来，坐了一通宵火车，天亮后冒雨行军一直走到下午，道路全糟糕透了，——有时根本没有路，公路被堵塞起来了，只好穿越田野和沼泽，一走走了七个小时，穿着又重又湿的军大衣，背着突击队的简单行装，这可不像郊游那样轻松喽。要知道谁也不愿意丢掉靴子，所以走一步就必须弯下腰，用手指抠住鞋舌头把靴子跟脚一起从黏黏的烂泥里拔出来。这样过一小块草地就得花一小时。眼下他们却赶到了，一切全仗着血气方刚，尽管激动又疲乏，他们却斗志旺盛，精力充沛，没法睡觉没法进食却照样挺了过来。他们浑身湿漉漉的，溅满了污泥，头上戴着蒙上灰布的钢盔，系钢盔的带子框住了脸庞，年轻的面孔依然红彤彤的。他们这么绯红着脸，是因为行军费劲儿吃力，是因为穿过泥泞的树林时目睹了自己遭受的伤亡。敌人侦察到了他们的行军路线，于是发射来榴霰弹和大口径的榴弹炮弹进行封锁，炮弹穿过林子散落进他们队伍中间，呼啸着、喷溅着、燃烧着，把大片林地狠狠地抽打、翻搅了一遍。\n\n他们必须穿过树林，这三千名热血沸腾的男孩子，他们作为增援部队，必须端起刺刀，去一起向那丘陵前后的战壕和燃烧的村庄发起冲锋，并坚决地冲到一个在命令里已经规定的地点；而这命令正藏在他们指挥官的皮包里。他们多达三千名；之所以这么多，意义就在于夺回了丘陵和村庄之后，他们还能剩下两千。他们是一个整体，一个即使付出了重大代价还有望继续战斗并取得胜利，并千口同声地对胜利发出“乌拉”的欢呼声的整体，——至于那些单个地牺牲掉了的人，当然不值一提。还有个别的人在急行军时就掉队了，这说明他太年轻、太脆弱。他脸色惨白，步履踉跄，咬着牙要求自己做个男子汉，可最终还是落下了。他硬撑着在大队伍边上跟了一段，后面的弟兄一群一群超过了他，随后他消失了，躺在了某个糟糕的地方。接着穿过弹片横飞的森林。可从林子里边涌出来的仍旧很多；三千之众足以经受住一次次放血，放血之后仍旧是支人头攒动的大部队。他们已经漫过经受了暴雨冲刷的大地、公路、小径和泥泞的田野，我们这些站在路旁观看的影子，便混迹在他们中间。在森林边上，训练有素地一批一批上好了刺刀，军号吹得哒哒哒响，战鼓擂得跟沉雷一般，于是弟兄们拼命向前冲锋，一边冲一边高声呐喊；不幸的只是双腿像梦里似的沉甸甸的，铅一般的土块粘在了他们的靴子上面。\n\n在呼啸而来的子弹前他们扑倒了，如果未被击中的话，又跳起来再往前冲，并勇敢地发出青春的呐喊。如果被击中了，子弹射进了额头、心脏或者肚肠，便胳膊乱伸两下，倒了下去，脸浸泡在泥污里，不再动弹。他们或者仰面倒下，背让军用背囊拱得老高，后脑勺钻进了泥地里，张开两手往空中乱抓。然而森林中不断涌出来新人，他们扑跌着、奔跑着、呐喊着，或者在死者中间踉跄着，向前冲去。\n\n这些背着背囊，端着刺刀，穿着肮脏的军大衣和皮靴的年轻小伙子！看着他们，你也很容易想象出另一些更合乎人道、更神圣美丽的画面。你可以想象：眼前是一片海湾，他们或者纵马疾驰，或者领着爱人在岸边漫步，嘴唇凑近温柔的姑娘耳畔窃窃私语，或者相互指点着练习张弓射箭。可现实却是另一番景象，却是鼻子掩埋在充满硝烟味儿的污泥里。尽管心中无比恐惧，怀着对母亲和故土的无尽思念，他们仍然乐于捐躯，因为这本身就是一件崇高的事情，即使并没有真正的理由要走到这一步。\n","source":"_posts/魔山11.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

13050\n我们在哪里？这是怎么回事？梦境把我们抛到了何处？薄暮、暴雨、泥泞，晦暗的天空燃烧着残霞，沉闷的雷声不断地咆哮，空中充满着湿气，尖厉的啸叫撕裂耳膜，蜂拥奔来的地狱恶犬发出狂吠，其间夹杂着崩裂声、喷溅声、撞击声，熊熊燃烧声，乒乒乓乓，轰轰隆隆，鬼哭狼嚎，鼓点的节奏越来越快，越来越急迫……那边有座森林，林子里蹿出来一群群灰白的人影，奔跑着、扑跌着、跳跃着。那边是一线连绵起伏的丘陵，丘陵背后的远方燃起了大火，火苗不时地聚集成熊熊的烈焰。在我们四周是如波浪起伏的田野，但已给炸得满目疮痍，七零八落。泥泞的公路上撒满折断的树枝，像森林里一样；一条满是沟沟坑坑的小路接着公路，在通往丘陵时划了一个弧形，树木光秃秃地立在冷雨里，枝杈嶙峋……这儿有块路标，——可想凭它找路却白费劲儿；即使它没给炸裂开，字迹也让晦明的光线弄得模模糊糊。到底是东还是西？只知道这是一片平原，而且正在打仗。我们呢只是路旁一些畏畏缩缩的影子，并且由于享有影子的安全而怀着羞惭；我们压根儿想不到夸夸其谈、自吹自擂，而是本着老老实实讲故事的精神，讲那些从树林中蜂拥而出的灰色的士兵，讲他们如何奔跑、扑跌，如何爬起来擂着战鼓继续前进；讲他们中有一个我们认识，是我们多年的旅伴，他就是那个善良却有罪的青年，我们曾经时常听见他的声音，因此想在他从我们的视线中彻底消失之前，再凝视一下他那单纯的脸。\n\n战斗已经持续一整天，上级调这些兄弟们前来增援，是为重新夺回两天前落到了敌人手里的丘陵阵地，以及背后那些燃烧着的村庄。调来了一个志愿兵团，士兵全都年纪轻轻，多数是大学生，刚上战场不久。他们半夜被集合起来，坐了一通宵火车，天亮后冒雨行军一直走到下午，道路全糟糕透了，——有时根本没有路，公路被堵塞起来了，只好穿越田野和沼泽，一走走了七个小时，穿着又重又湿的军大衣，背着突击队的简单行装，这可不像郊游那样轻松喽。要知道谁也不愿意丢掉靴子，所以走一步就必须弯下腰，用手指抠住鞋舌头把靴子跟脚一起从黏黏的烂泥里拔出来。这样过一小块草地就得花一小时。眼下他们却赶到了，一切全仗着血气方刚，尽管激动又疲乏，他们却斗志旺盛，精力充沛，没法睡觉没法进食却照样挺了过来。他们浑身湿漉漉的，溅满了污泥，头上戴着蒙上灰布的钢盔，系钢盔的带子框住了脸庞，年轻的面孔依然红彤彤的。他们这么绯红着脸，是因为行军费劲儿吃力，是因为穿过泥泞的树林时目睹了自己遭受的伤亡。敌人侦察到了他们的行军路线，于是发射来榴霰弹和大口径的榴弹炮弹进行封锁，炮弹穿过林子散落进他们队伍中间，呼啸着、喷溅着、燃烧着，把大片林地狠狠地抽打、翻搅了一遍。\n\n他们必须穿过树林，这三千名热血沸腾的男孩子，他们作为增援部队，必须端起刺刀，去一起向那丘陵前后的战壕和燃烧的村庄发起冲锋，并坚决地冲到一个在命令里已经规定的地点；而这命令正藏在他们指挥官的皮包里。他们多达三千名；之所以这么多，意义就在于夺回了丘陵和村庄之后，他们还能剩下两千。他们是一个整体，一个即使付出了重大代价还有望继续战斗并取得胜利，并千口同声地对胜利发出“乌拉”的欢呼声的整体，——至于那些单个地牺牲掉了的人，当然不值一提。还有个别的人在急行军时就掉队了，这说明他太年轻、太脆弱。他脸色惨白，步履踉跄，咬着牙要求自己做个男子汉，可最终还是落下了。他硬撑着在大队伍边上跟了一段，后面的弟兄一群一群超过了他，随后他消失了，躺在了某个糟糕的地方。接着穿过弹片横飞的森林。可从林子里边涌出来的仍旧很多；三千之众足以经受住一次次放血，放血之后仍旧是支人头攒动的大部队。他们已经漫过经受了暴雨冲刷的大地、公路、小径和泥泞的田野，我们这些站在路旁观看的影子，便混迹在他们中间。在森林边上，训练有素地一批一批上好了刺刀，军号吹得哒哒哒响，战鼓擂得跟沉雷一般，于是弟兄们拼命向前冲锋，一边冲一边高声呐喊；不幸的只是双腿像梦里似的沉甸甸的，铅一般的土块粘在了他们的靴子上面。\n\n在呼啸而来的子弹前他们扑倒了，如果未被击中的话，又跳起来再往前冲，并勇敢地发出青春的呐喊。如果被击中了，子弹射进了额头、心脏或者肚肠，便胳膊乱伸两下，倒了下去，脸浸泡在泥污里，不再动弹。他们或者仰面倒下，背让军用背囊拱得老高，后脑勺钻进了泥地里，张开两手往空中乱抓。然而森林中不断涌出来新人，他们扑跌着、奔跑着、呐喊着，或者在死者中间踉跄着，向前冲去。\n\n这些背着背囊，端着刺刀，穿着肮脏的军大衣和皮靴的年轻小伙子！看着他们，你也很容易想象出另一些更合乎人道、更神圣美丽的画面。你可以想象：眼前是一片海湾，他们或者纵马疾驰，或者领着爱人在岸边漫步，嘴唇凑近温柔的姑娘耳畔窃窃私语，或者相互指点着练习张弓射箭。可现实却是另一番景象，却是鼻子掩埋在充满硝烟味儿的污泥里。尽管心中无比恐惧，怀着对母亲和故土的无尽思念，他们仍然乐于捐躯，因为这本身就是一件崇高的事情，即使并没有真正的理由要走到这一步。\n","slug":"魔山11","published":1,"updated":"2024-03-12T07:21:11.506Z","layout":"post","photos":[],"_id":"cm4l3vksp0062pmnkan5y6n9o","content":"<p>第七章

<!--more-->\n生命是什么？谁也不知道。谁也不知道产生生命的那个原点，燃起生命之火的那个原点。没有什么直接来自这个原点，或者只是差强人意地在生的范畴内与这个点相连接；然而，生命本身却显得直接。如果对此可以讲些什么的话，那就是：生命的形式必定已经发展得十分高级，高级到了在无生命的世界里根本没有什么可与之伦比。在有伪足的阿米巴原虫和脊椎动物之间，进化的差距微乎其微，比起最简单的生命现象与那些连死都不配称的自然物之间的差距来，真叫微不足道。之所以讲“连死都不配称”，是因为它们乃无机物。须知死只是生的逻辑否定；可在生命与无生命自然界之间张开着一个巨大的深渊，科学界努力想在上面架起一座桥梁，结果只是徒劳。人们设法用各种理论来弥合这一鸿沟，结果鸿沟吞没了这些理论，鸿沟本身的深度和宽度却丝毫未因此而减少。为了找到中间起连结作用的环节，人们不惜荒谬地假设有一种无结构的生命物质，有一些未获得生机的有机体，它们可以在蛋白溶液中自行凝结成有机物质，就像水晶在母液中结晶一样——可实际上，有机的差异始终同时是一切生命的准备和表现，还找不出任何生物，其存在不归功于双亲的生育。有人因从海洋深处打捞起来了所谓的原液而欣喜若狂，最后还是出乖露丑了事。事实表明，是把石膏沉淀物当作原生物质了。可是为了避免在一个奇迹面前止步不前——须知所谓构成生命的物质跟无生命自然界相同，并且最后也分解为同样的物质，算得上是个奇迹喽。人们就不得不进一步相信另一个奇迹，即有机物产生于无机物的原初生殖理论。如此继续下去，就得想出一些中间环节和过渡阶段，就得假定存在一些比已知所有生物都更低级的生物，而这样的低等生物本身又还有自然生命冲动的先驱，即谁也见不到的所谓原虫；因为它在多么高倍数的显微镜下也不显现出来，而其假想的产生的前提，是必须完成蛋白质的……\n\n生命到底是什么？是温暖，是某种无定型的不稳定状态的热产物，是物质在发热发烧，是由此而来的不停分解和再生的复杂过程，以及伴随着不断产生结构精巧的蛋白分子的过程。这就是那原本不可能存在的东西的存在，这就是那在分解与再生的既复杂又热烈的过程中，甜蜜、痛苦而又艰难地在生存之点上保持着平衡的东西的存在。它既不具有物质性，也不是精神。它是介乎两者之间的某种东西，是一种现象，一种以物质为依托的现象，就像瀑布上的彩虹，就像火焰。可它尽管不具物质性，却富于感性，以致于有所欲求，有所厌恶，是变得敏感而易受刺激的物质的不知羞耻，是存在的放纵状态。这是宇宙的贞节冷漠中一点点隐秘而易感的悸动，是来自养料吸收和排泄的淫秽不洁的隐私，是来源和构成不明的碳酸气及其他有害污物的排放。这是通过其非稳定性而成为可能，并注定要按其形成法则进行的滋生漫长现象，也即要从水、蛋白质、盐和脂肪的某种蒸发物不断地衍生、成形，变成所谓的肉；而这肉不但会有形，而且会形象高贵，美丽动人，然而同时又是感性和欲望的化身。因为这形象和美丽与文学和音乐作品里不一样，没有精神作为依托，也没有中性的、消耗掉了精神、以无害的方式使精神感性化了的材料作为依托，如同雕塑中的形象和美那样。它们的依托和成形，主要靠的是那种不知怎么便有肉欲觉醒了的物质，是那种有机的、不断在腐朽和再生的物质本身，是发出臭气的肉……\n","source":"_posts/魔山5.md","raw":"---\ntitle:

8167\n那是肮脏的立场，塞特姆布里尼宣布，是愚蠢的观点，对这样的观点他几乎不屑于驳斥。因为“神圣的地位”也罢，工程师跟别人讲的“基督教对苦难的敬重”也罢，统统都是谎言，都建立在欺骗、妄断和心理错觉上面。健康人同情生病的人，并将同情提高为敬重，是因为他简直无法设想，要是换上自己该如何才能忍受那样的苦难——这同情被严重地夸大了，跟病人毫无关系，只是一个思维和幻想的错误结果，表现在健康人把自己的体验方式强加给了生病的人，仿佛后者也是一个不得不承受病人的痛苦的健康人似的——这完完全全是个错觉。病人就是病人，有着病人的脾性和改变了的感受方式；疾病造就了病人，使他与它相安无事，谁也离不开谁；还有感知力的减弱、丧失、麻痹，以及自然的种种精神和道德的适应与缓解措施，都被健康人天真地忽略了。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8242\n依他的看法，在这儿胡诌什么人类的尊严实属荒谬，因为我们真正的尊严存在于精神中，而不存在于肉体里；人的心灵太过分倾向于从肉体中去吸取整个生命之乐，给肉体一些疼痛因而就成了绝对值得提倡的手段，用它可以败坏感官享乐的胃口，就像将乐趣从肉体中赶出来，让它回到精神中去，以便精神重新取得统治地位。把笞刑指责为尤其可鄙的手段，是很愚蠢的。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8267 “于是便有了死尸般的盲从一说！”</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8272\n土葬这种办法真是太陈旧、太过时了——在现代的环境条件下！城市扩张！大量吞食土地的墓园！飞涨的地价！不得不使用现代交通手段使葬礼合理化！塞特姆布里尼先生对这一切都知之甚详，言之凿凿。他特别嘲笑那种老鳏夫，还学他们弯腰驼背地每天去亡妻坟前的样子，说是去那儿和她谈谈知心话。这样的老古董该首先享用可贵的生命财富，好好度过自己所剩无多的光阴才是。再说，现代化大公墓里人挨着人，对于他们思念故旧的悠悠情怀，不也很煞风景吗？让烈焰来消灭尸体，这是多么干净卫生，多么庄严高尚，比起任它自行腐烂和蛆虫咬噬的可悲结局来，简直可以讲富有英雄气概！是啊，使用这种新的方法，心灵——人对永久存在的需要——也可以得到满足。因为在火中消失了的，原本就是那些变化着的东西，那些人体里尚在出生前就处于新陈代谢状态的成分；至于另一些很少参加新陈代谢而不变地陪伴着人一辈子的成分，也就能经住火烧，也就变成了骨灰。因此，活着的人搜集收藏骨灰，就等于将故去亲人身体里永不泯灭的一部分珍藏起来了。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8282\n噢，那还用说。塞特姆布里尼打算抓住人类对生物学事实的非理性态度不放。他指的是那些原始信仰的阶段，那时候死是一种恐怖，始终被令人战栗的神秘气氛包围着，因此人不能用理性的清醒目光去审视这一自然现象。有多野蛮啊！对死的恐惧发源于文明程度极低的时代，那时人通常都死于暴力；而事实上这样的横死总带着可怖的性质，久而久之，人一想到死，自然就感到害怕。可是，随着整个健康科学的越来越发达，个人的安全越来越有保障，自然死亡便成为常事；而对于一个劳动者来说，在辛勤一生之后想到永久地安息更一点不觉可怕，倒认为是正常的值得欢迎的了。不，死既非可怖的事，也非殉难牺牲；死纯粹是一种合乎理性的、生理学上必然的和值得欢迎的现象。不过再没完没了地讨论这个问题，将是对生命的剥夺。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8328\n他们不是“人形动物”，塞特姆布里尼先生纠正说；那是些人，跟他、工程师、以及发言者本身一样的人——只是这些人意志薄弱，成了不健全的社会的牺牲品。他讲到一个重罪犯人，一个杀死多人的凶手，属于检察官们在最后的公诉状中习惯地称之为“兽性的”或“人形禽兽”一类。这个人却在牢房的四壁写满了诗句，而且写得很不坏；这些诗句——比起他的检察官们偶尔心血来潮的创作来，不知要好多少倍。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8349\n不错。罪犯自然会全身心渗透着犯罪意识。因为罪犯就是罪犯，不可能也愿意成为别样的人；而这正是罪恶的本性。纳夫塔先生将罪恶与功勋的概念从经验范畴提升到了形而上的范畴。他说，在行为和行动中自然是前定的因素起决定作用，无所谓自由可言，但存在中显然有自由。人正好是他想要成为的那个样子，而且至死不会改变；他正是“为他的生”而乐于杀人，因此也就以他的生命作为偿还，这并不过分。他希望死，因为他已得到了最大的满足。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8363\n纳夫塔证实，德行和健康确实不是虔诚的状态。如果弄清楚了信仰与理性和道德根本没任何关系，他说，那就收获不小。须知，他补充说，信仰与生活毫无牵连。生活所依赖的条件和基础，一部分属于认识的范畴，一部分属于道德的范畴。前者系时间、空间和目的，后者指伦理和理性。所有这一切对于信仰来说不只是异己的和无意义的，而且是敌对的；须知正是它们构成了生命存在，构成了所谓健康，也就是市民的本性和庸俗平凡。而信仰世界，肯定是其绝对的反面，而且是绝对天才的反面。</p>\n<p>第六章 - 神圣的事业 &gt; 位置 8381\n“好一盘令人作呕的大杂烩！”塞特姆布里尼大声呵斥。善与恶，光明与黑暗，一切全搅和在一起！没有判断！没有意志！但有谴责该受谴责的东西的能力！纳夫塔先生是否知道，他在青年耳边将上帝与魔鬼混为一谈，并假杂乱无章的二位一体之名否定伦理的原则，他这么做结果到底否定了什么？他否定了价值——否定了任何价值判断本身——说来叫人恶心！太妙啦，不再有善恶之分，只有一个伦理上混混沌沌的宇宙！也不存在各有其批判价值的个体，只存在包容一切、平衡一切的整体，只存在整体里神秘的沉沦。个人……</p>"},{"title":"企鹅经典：《魔山》摘录

8883\n海平线挺高，宽阔的海面像还在变宽，这是因为汉斯·卡斯托普从相当高处俯瞰着海湾。山脉延伸着，突出到海中，形成长满树丛的海角，到了海湾中心又折回来形成一个半圆，逶迤直至他坐的地方并继续向前。这是一道岩岸，他蹲在让太阳晒热了的石级上。在他面前，由长满苔藓和灌木丛的巨岩构成从高到低的陡坡，渐渐演变为平缓的海滩。在那儿，在芦苇丛中，被海潮冲洗圆滑了的石头再围成无数蓝色的湾仔、小港和水塘。这块阳光灿烂的土地，这道高峻的岩岸，这片活泼愉快的滩头，还有大海、小岛以及岛与岛之间往来穿梭的船儿，真是远远近近无处不住着人，无处没有南国的阳光和大海养育的孩子们在活动和休息，一个聪明、愉快、美丽、年轻的人类，望着他们真是件美事——汉斯·卡斯托普为领受这美妙的感觉，大大地敞开心扉，痛苦而爱慕地敞开了心扉。\n\n小伙子们嬉闹着骑马狂奔，马嘶鸣着，扬鬃奋蹄。有几匹烈马，他们只好放长缰绳拽住，要不就骑在光光的马背上，用赤脚夹击马腹，赶着它们向大海冲去。阳光中，小伙子们背部的肌肉在古铜色的皮肤下颤动，他们对牲口或者彼此发出的吆喝声，不知怎的听起来异常迷人。在一片像山间湖泊似的倒映着岩岸的小海湾前，有一群年轻姑娘在跳舞。一位将颈后的头发特别富于魅力地在头上挽成髻子的少女，坐在一旁吹奏牧笛伴舞；她眼睛不看手指，而望着她的女友。舞女们长裙飘飘，或笑盈盈地舒展着双臂独舞，或耳鬓厮磨，成对成双，舞步翩跹。坐在她们背后吹牧笛的少女白皙而苗条，由于手臂弯着，侧面看上去较丰满。另一些女友或坐着，或相互搂着站在一起，边看边轻声交谈。还有一伙青年男子在练习射箭。汉斯· 卡斯托普心中油然生起幸福、快慰的感情，他看见年长者如何指导初学的小毛头张弓、搭箭，和他们一块儿瞄准目标，如何笑呵呵地去扶持被弓的反弹力弄得站立不稳的后生学子，而在前一个瞬间，箭矢已嗖的一声射出去了。还有些人在钓鱼。他们有的趴在岸边的石板上，一条小腿在空中晃来晃去，让鱼线垂在海水中，歪着脑袋，悠悠闲闲地与旁边的钓友答话；这一位呢，则仰着身子坐着，将钓饵甩得老远。还有一些人在干活儿，正拉的拉、顶的顶、推的推，把一艘船舷高高的带桅杆的大船送下海去。孩子们在防浪木中间跑跳着，欢叫着。一个少妇摊开四肢仰卧在沙滩上，眼睛望着后方，一只手撩开胸前的花衣服，一只手去抓头顶上带叶的果子；那是一个健壮男人伸长胳膊悬在她头上逗她的，叫她可望而不可即。人们或倚靠在岩隙缝中；或迟疑着是不是下海游泳，用手臂交叉抱着自己的肩，伸出脚尖去试水温。成对的情侣漫步海滩，男的把嘴凑到女的耳朵边上，悄悄说着情话。白毛长长的羊群在石坡山上跳来跳去。年轻牧人一手叉腰，一手扶着牧杖站在高处，他生有一头棕色鬈发，戴着一顶后面的边沿卷起来的小毡帽。\n\n第六章 - 雪 > 位置 8948\n“我想，我是在做梦吧，”他自言自语地喃喃着，“梦得美妙极了，可怕极了。从根本上讲，我一直清楚这是个梦，一切都是我自己想出来的——那树木繁茂的园子和滋润的空气，以及接下去的美好景象与可怕情景，我几乎全都预先知道。我怎么会知道这些，想出这些，使自己感到幸福，感到恐怖呢？我从哪儿弄来那迷人的海湾，还有那由一个美少年的目光引导我走进去的神庙群呢？我想说，一个人不单单靠自己的心灵做梦，也代替匿名的集体做梦，只不过以个人的方式。你只是那巨大心灵的一个微小分子，它通过你做梦，以你的方式，梦见一些它永远悄悄在梦想着的事物——梦见它的青春，它的希望，它的幸福，它的安宁……它的人肉宴。眼下我倚靠着自己的圆柱，头脑里实际还留着我的梦的残余，留着对人肉宴的冰冷的恐惧，以及对先前美景的由衷的喜悦——为那光明人类的幸福和高尚情操而感到的喜悦。这是属于我的，我坚持认为，我有不可剥夺的权利靠在这儿，做这样的梦。我从此地山上的人们那里知道了许多乱七八糟的东西以及理性的东西。我跟着纳夫塔和塞特姆布里尼，在极其危险的崇山峻岭中转来转去。我了解人的一切。我认识人的肉和血，我把普希毕斯拉夫· 希培的铅笔还给了有病的克拉芙迪娅· 舒舍。可是谁认识肉体，认识生命，他也就认识死。不过，这并非全部——多半还只是个开端，如果从教育的角度看问题的话。还必须加上另外一半，相对的一半。要知道，一切对疾病和死亡的兴趣，不过是对生命的兴趣的一种表现方式而已，正如人道主义的医学科学所证明的那样。这种学科总在彬彬有礼地用拉丁文谈论生命及其病患，仅仅是那个巨大而急迫的问题的一方面；我现在要直呼其名，怀着无比的好感和同情：那就是生活的问题儿童的问题，就是人和人的地位与尊严问题……我对此懂得不少，从此地山上的人那儿学到了许多。我从平原被赶上高山，可怜我几乎喘不过气来；然而，从我的圆柱脚下，我这会儿挺不坏地看见了全貌……我梦见人的地位，梦见他们那个明达知礼、互敬互爱的群体，但在这个群体背后的神庙中，却上演着吃小孩的可怕一幕。他们，太阳的孩子们，在静静地观看那可怕的情景时，相互还会一样的文质彬彬，殷勤友善吗？他们要是能这样，那可真叫风雅、大度！我从心眼儿里同情他们，而不同情纳夫塔，也不同情塞特姆布里尼，他们俩都是空谈家。一个放荡而邪恶，一个只会吹理性的小号角，还自以为用目光能震住疯子，真叫人倒胃口。说来说去，不过是庸人哲学，纯粹的道德说教，非宗教思想。同样，我对纳夫塔，对他的宗教，也不怀好感；他的宗教只是把上帝与魔鬼、善与恶搅混成一个大杂烩，正好让人一头栽进去，以达到神秘地沉沦在一般之中的目的。这两位教育家！他们的争论和矛盾本身也不过是个大杂烩，是一片乱糟糟的厮杀声，谁只要脑子稍稍自由一点，心灵稍稍虔诚一点，就不至于被蒙蔽。谈什么贵族化问题！什么高贵不高贵！什么死与生，疾病与健康，精神与自然！难道它们是矛盾？我要问：难道它们是问题？不，这不成问题。还有高贵不高贵也不成问题。死必然寓于生之中，没有必然的死也便没有生；主的人的地位正处于中央、处于混乱与理性之间，正像他的国度也处于神秘的集团与不稳定的个体之间。从我的圆柱往下看去，情形就是这样。处在这个地位上，他应该彬彬有礼，自己对自己表现得友善谦恭——因为只有他是高贵的，而非矛盾冲突。人应主宰矛盾冲突，而不是相反。也就是说，人比矛盾冲突更加高贵，比死也更高贵，对于死来说太高贵了——这便是他头脑的自由思想；比生更高贵，对于生来说太高贵了——这便是心灵的虔诚信仰。这就是我做的诗，一首关于人的梦幻之诗。我愿铭记着它。我愿做个善良人。我不容许死亡统治我的思想！因为善良与仁爱存在于我的思想中，不存在于任何其他地方。死是巨大的威力。人摘下帽子对它表示敬畏，然后便踮起脚尖擦过它身边，继续前进。死戴着往昔的庄严领圈，人们为了对它表示敬意，也穿着黑色的丧衣。理性在它面前显得一副蠢相，因为理性仅仅是道德，死却是自由、混乱、无定型和欲。欲，我的梦说，不是爱。死与爱——这是差劲儿的一对儿，乏味的一对儿，很不和谐的一对儿！爱是死的对头，只有爱，而非理性，能战胜死。还有形式，也只产生于爱与善：一个明智友善的团体，一个美好的人类之国的形式和礼仪——在静观着人肉筵时也不改变。啊，我就这么清楚地梦见了，就这么很好地‘执了政’！我要铭记着它。我要在心中对死保持忠诚，然而又牢记不忘：对死和往昔的忠诚只会造成邪恶、淫欲和对人类的敌视，要是任凭它支配我们的思想和‘执政’的话。为了善和爱的缘故，人不应让死主宰和支配自己的思想。到这儿我该醒了……因为我的梦已做完，已到达目的地。我早就在寻找这个词：到达目的地，在希培出现的地方，在我的阳台上，在随便哪儿。也是为了寻找这个目的地，我身不由己来到了风雪山野中。现在我找到了它。我的梦将它再清楚不过地铭刻在我心中，我将永远牢记。是的，我欢欣鼓舞，热血沸腾。我的心有力地跳着，我知道为什么。它这样跳不仅仅出于身体的原因，不像尸体还会长指甲似的；它跳得更富人情味，更多是因为心灵幸福的缘故。心灵的幸福是一种佳酿——我梦里的词儿——比波尔多葡萄酒和英国啤酒都醇美，像爱和生命一般流贯我周身的血管，使我猛然从睡梦里苏醒过来。我自然知道得很清楚，我年轻的生命在睡梦中处于极度的危险……醒一醒，醒一醒！睁开眼睛！在雪地里，是你的脚，是你的腿！将它们收拢，站直！快瞧——天气好了！”\n\n第六章 - 好样儿的士兵 > 位置 9179\n您瞧，造成世界混乱的根源，就在于精神的迅速进步与物质的惰性和发展极其迟缓之间的不协调。必须承认，这种不协调足以用来为精神对现实的漠不关心作辩护；须知，通常的情况都是精神早已对那些引起革命的酵素讨厌到了作呕的程度。事实上，对于鲜活的精神来说，死去了的精神比某些玄武岩还可恶，因为玄武岩至少并不要求人家承认它们为精神和生命。可往昔的现实残余结成的玄武岩，它们远远被精神抛在了背后，失去了与现实这个概念的任何联系，却凭借惰性继续存在着、维持着，乏味到了不自觉其乏味的程度。我只是一般言之，您却可以用我的话去观察那种人道主义的自由思想，它自以为在当今反对统治与权威的斗争中还可以充作英雄气概。唉，还有那些它借以证明自己的生命力的种种灾难，那些它准备有朝一日庆祝的迟到而虚幻的种种胜利！一想到这些，鲜活的精神便无聊得要死，岂知事实上恰恰只有它，将在这些灾难中成为唯一的胜利者和受益者——它，将融汇过去的因素与远大的未来于一身，成为真正的革命……\n","source":"_posts/魔山9.md","raw":"---\ntitle:
